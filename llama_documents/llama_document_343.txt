JUDGMENT
Per Sri Rajendra Singh, Member- The brief facts of the case are that, that the complainants, a
resident of 136, Tulsi Nagar, Orai, Jalaun was interested to purchase a flat in a project launched by
the opposite parties. The opposite parties provisionally allotted one plot of land bearing unit
no.P-119 in Country Homes-II at Jaypee Greens Sports City, Gutam BuddhNagar having its
allotment letter reference no.JGSP CH20P119on May 9, 2012. The plot in question has been located
as per location plan, having area of 167.06 sq. mtrs. for consideration of Rs.63,36,058.00 and the
parties are ready for the same.
It is also stated that in the allotment letter that for the purpose of clause 6.8 of the Standard Terms
and Conditions, any increase or decrease in the super area shall be payable or refundable on pro rata
basis. From the perusal of allotment letter, it transpires that the opposite parties have never
informed or provided the copy of standard terms and condition at any stage. It is further specifically
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/19813068/ 3Mahendra Gupta vs Jai Prakash Associates Ltd on 14 September, 2022
mentioned in the provisional allotment letter in respect of the schedule of the payment as follows:
"The consideration and the other amounts (as defined in the standard terms and conditions) shall
be payable on the dates as specifically mentioned in the payment plan enclosed as annexure III. All
payments are to be made by local cheques/ demand drafts drawn in favour of Jaypee Sports
InternationalLimited and payment at Delhi."
The complainant has been allotted a unique customer ID, which is "JGSPCH20P119" and opposite
parties has further requested to the complainant that to quote customer ID and unit reference
number in all future communication. It is further stated that subject to the standard terms and
condition, the possession of the said plot is expected to be delivered to the complainant with in a
period of 18 (eighteen) months thereof.
The opposite parties stated that "the standard terms and conditions, of provisional allotment
include the undertaking given by the applicant. Further subject to the standard terms and condition
and undertaking given by the applicant, this provisional allotment letter shall prevail over all over
terms and conditions, specification, etc. given in our brochures, advertisement, price list and any
other sale documents. This cancels and supersedes all other previous written and oral
understandings in respect of the provisional allotment contemplated by this letter.
In respect of the terms and conditions as mentioned in the present provisional allotment letter the
complainant has paid the part consideration amount as per the payment plan since April 20, 2012
till23.3.2013.
In respect of the payment plan, the complainant paid up to Rs.56,45,418.00 since the first
installment i.e.April 20, 2012 till 23.3.2013 against the consideration amount. The complainant has
paid maximum of the construction amount but the opposite parties failed to provide the possession
of plot in question by execution of sale deed as per the terms and conditions and also failed to
handover the possession of the plot in 18 months. The complainant made several requests to the
opposite parties but in vein. The complainant met with the opposite parties but they have not paid
any attention. The opposite parties were bound to provide the possession of the plot in the promised
period of 18 months but they failed to do so. It is deficiency in service and also unfair trade practice.
After the mail conversation the complainant met with the opposite parties several times but they
did not pay any attention. Hence, the complainant has filed this complaint before this Hon'ble State
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/19813068/ 4Mahendra Gupta vs Jai Prakash Associates Ltd on 14 September, 2022
Commission with the following releifs:
Opposite parties be directed to provide the possession of the plot by executing of sale deed as
allotted provisionally bearing unit referenceno.P-119in Country Homes-II at Jaypee Greens Sports
City, GutamBuddh Nagar having its allotment letter reference no.JGSPCH20 P119 on May 9, 2012.
Refund the cost of flat as exist today according to report of valuver as valuate with the interest of 9%
on the amount which has been hold by the opposite parties as paid by the complainant till date.
Opposite parties be directed to pay the compensation for making delay in possession of plot i.e.
Rs.5,00,000.00 along with 9% from the date of initial payment till the date of possession.
Opposite parties be directed to pay the cost of suit.
Any other order which this Hon'ble Commission may deem fit just and proper may kindly by passed
in favour of the complainant.
The opposite party no.1 has filed itswritten statement stating that there is no deficiency in service on
their part and they were not involved in any unfair trade practice. The purported delay in
completion of flat due to force majeure conditions. It is submitted that moratorium has been
imposed over the respondent no.2 vide order dated 9.8.2017 passed by NCLT, Allahabad and the
same has been taken into consideration by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of Chitra
Sharma&ors. vs. Union of India &ors. stay of proceedings against the respondent no.2 has been
ordered vide its order dated 11.9.2017.
It is also pertinent to mention herein that, the order of possession of unit in question have been
already issued to the complainants vide offer of possession letter dated 12.12.2014. Respondent have
already performed its obligations but the complainants have not performed their obligations and did
not complete the registration formalities with the respondent. The complainants have been violating
the terms of the allotment by failing to make payment of the installments as per the payment plan
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/19813068/ 5Mahendra Gupta vs Jai Prakash Associates Ltd on 14 September, 2022
opted by the complainants. As on dated i.e. 5.4.2018, the complainants have to make the payment of
Rs.44,26,725.00. It is pertinent to mention herein that the complainants are already in default and
in breach of the terms of the allotment and standard terms and condition agreed between the
parties. Therefore, the complainants have no right to file the instant complaint against the
respondents and the said complaint is liable to be dismissed on the ground alone.
It is also evident to mention that the respondent has also given rebate on delay possession of
Rs.1,52,231.00 to the complainant. Respondent has always co-operate with the complainant but it is
the complainant who is not perform his obligations and complete the registration formalities till
date.
Further at that movement under the directions of the order of Hon'ble Supreme Court dated
10.1.2016 the home buyers who have invested in Jaiprakash Associates Limited (JAL) raised their
grievance before the Hon'ble Suprme Court in the matter of writ petition Civil no.744/2017, Chitra
Sharma &ors. vs. Union of India &ors. and contended that for redressal of their grievance a
web-portal be created. The Hon'ble Supreme Court vide its order dated 10.1.2018 directed Mr.
Pawan Shree Agarwal, learned Amicus Curie to create an independent web-portal in respect of the
home buyer of JAL, which shall reflect the details of the home buyers.
Further the Hon'ble Supreme Court vide its order dated21.3.2018 has also directed as under:-
"We should intent to make it absolutely clear that for the present, we are only concerned with those
home buyers who intent to have refund. In the next phase, we may consider the grievances, if any, of
the home buyers who intent to have the flats. In that regards, we think it appropriate to hear Mr.
Parag Tripathi, learned senior counsel appearing for interim resolution professional (IRP) and Mr.
Jayant Bhushan and Mr. Sanjay Hegde and others, learned senior counsel appearing for some
associations of home buyers who intend to have their flats."
As our order for deposit of Rs.2000 crores has not been complied with, we intend to pass the
following directions:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/19813068/ 6Mahendra Gupta vs Jai Prakash Associates Ltd on 14 September, 2022
JAL shall deposit a further sum of Rs.200 crores in two installments, as agreed by the Managing
Director who is present in court today. The first installment of Rs.100 crores shall be deposited by
15th April, 2018 and the second installment of Rs.100 crores shall be deposited by 10th May, 2018;
It is submitted by Mr. Pawan Shree Agarwal, learned amicus curie that as per his portal an amount
of Rs.1300 crores, at present, is required to be refunded towards the principal sum of those home
buyers who, as of today, seek refund. The figure of Rs.1300 crores is a per record of JAL.
In view of the aforesaid, we would require Mr. Agarwal to prepare a project wise chart indicating the
number of persons in respect of that project and the stage of completion of the respective projects so
that appropriate order can be passed for disbursement of amount on prorate basis to the home
buyers;
Mr. Agarwal, learned amicus curie shall keep the portal operational. However, the requests of only
those persons on the portal who have sought refund as of today will be considered at this stage.
In view of the above, it is crystal clear that the grievance of the home buyers who have invested in
Jaiprakash Associates Limited (JAL) is now being looked into and considered by Hon'ble Supreme
Court. Therefore, the complainant have any grievance so he can file on the web-portal created by
Supreme Court. It is desirable in view of the judicial propriety that the instant complaint is not
proceeded further as the Hon'ble Supreme Court is ceased of the cases regarding housing projects of
JAL.
It is submitted that the claim regarding mental agony being imaginative & without any basis, do not
relate to claim regarding the subject apartment. It is to be proved by the claimant with strict proofs
and therefore, the same is untenable in the eyes of law and liable to be dismissed.
The complainants have prayed a compensation of Rs.5 lacs alongwith 9% from the date of initial
payment till the date of possession. It is submitted that Hon'ble Supreme Court in its various
judgments has held that any compensation for delay in delivery is to be the loss incurred by the
allottee, the complainants have failed ot submit any proof before this Hob'ble Commission ot show
the loss incurred by it. Such prayers seeking unreasonable compensation only show the speculative
intention f the complainant and as such it is clear that the complainants have filed the complaint for
making undue profits and this is an abuse of the process of court and the provisions of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/19813068/ 7Mahendra Gupta vs Jai Prakash Associates Ltd on 14 September, 2022
Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
It is also stated that as per the contents of the instant complaint the complainants are residing at
136,Tulsi Nagar, Orai, Jalaun, Uttar Pradesh. Further in the instant complaint the complainants
have no where alleged that they are presently residing in any rented house and have not submitted
any proof in this behalf. This shows the speculative/ commercial intention of the complainant.
From the facts detailed above, it is crystal clear that the complainants are not consumers and have
filed the instant complaint only for making undue profits and this is an abuse of the process of court
and the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Therefore, the complainants are not a
consumers as defined in section 2(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and the present
complaint is liable to be dismissed on this ground alone.
The complainants herein approached respondent and submitted an application dated 17.4.2012
seeking allotment of one apartment in the said project of the respondent clause 6 of the undertaking
given by the complainants attached with the said application read as under:
"6. I/we have seen and understood the scheme of development, tentative plans/other documents at
Jaypee Greens and I/we also agree to abide by all the terms and conditions of NOIDA or any other
statutory or civic authority, to which the JIL and consequently, the applicant, is subject to or any
other condition which the company/JIL may prescribe."
Pursuant to the above, the respondent as promoters herein issued a provisional allotment letter
dated 9.5.2012 allotting a plot bearing unit reference no.PCH02P0119 in Country Homes-II project
of the respondent admeasuring a super area of 1370 sq. ft. in favour of the complainants herein. The
provisional allotment letter provided the total consideration of the said unit as Rs.50,14,170.00
excluding other charges and a payment plan was also provided therein. The time period for
possession was provided as 36 months in the said provisional allotment letter subject to the
standard terms and conditions agreed by the complainants.
Clause 7.1 and 7.2 of the standard terms and conditions as agreed by the prospective
buyer/customers/complainants provides that:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/19813068/ 8Mahendra Gupta vs Jai Prakash Associates Ltd on 14 September, 2022
"7.1 The company/JIL shall make best efforts to deliver possession of the said premises to the
applicant within the period more specifically described in the provisional allotment letter with a
further grace period of 90 days. If the completion of the said premises is delayed by reasons of
non-availability or scarcity of steel and/or cement and/or other building materials and/or water
supply and for electric power and/or slow down, strike and/or due to dispute with the construction
agency employed by the company, lock-out or civil commotion or nay militant action or by reason of
war or enemy action or earthquake or any act of God or if non-
delivery of possession is as a result of any law or as a result of any restrictions imposed by a
Government Authority or delay in the sanction of building/zoning plans/grant of
completion/occupation certificates by any Governmental Authority or for any other reason beyond
the control of the Company hereinafter referred to as "force Majeure Events" and each individual
event referred to as a (force Majeure Event) the company/JIL shall be entitled to a reasonable
extension of time for delivery of possession of the said premises."
"7.2 Nothing contained herein shall be construed to give rise to any right to a claim by way of
compensation/damages/ loss of profit or consequential losses against the company/JIL on account
of delay in handing over possession for any of the aforesaid conditions beyond the control of the
Company. If however the company/JIL fails to deliver possession of the aid premises within the
stipulated period as mentioned herein above, and within the further grace period of 90 days
thereafter, the applicant shall be entitled to compensation for delay thereafter @ Rs.5/- per sq. ft.
per month for the super area of he said premises ("rebate"). The time consumed by the occurrences
of force majure events shall be excluded while computing the time delay for the delivery of
possession of the said premises."
Apart from above, it is also relevant to mention herein that the Hon'ble National Green Tribunal
(NGT) vide its order dated 11.1.2013 retrained all builders of Noida & Greater Noida, including the
respondent, from extracting nay quantity of underground water for the purpose of construction or
otherwise and the said restriction is operative even today.
Even otherwise, the respondent is duly paying delay compensation the allottee who had been
payment the demanded raised on them as per payment plan in terms of clause 7.2 of the standard
terms and conditions and therefore, the prayers made in the instant complaint are clearly untenable
as the complainants therein is trying to extort money towards excess interest beyond the agreed
terms of the contract executed between the parties. Further, as has been established herein above,
there is no negligence on the part of the respondent herein and the delay has been only due to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/19813068/ 9Mahendra Gupta vs Jai Prakash Associates Ltd on 14 September, 2022
orders passed by the National Green Tribunal subsequently affirmed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court
as well as other factors not attributable to the respondent herein and therefore, the respondent
cannot be directed to pay any compensation to the complainants herein.
It is evident that the complainants herein has deliberately suppressed material facts in his complaint
and has made fake allegations against the respondent herein. It is therefore evident that he has not
approached this Hob'ble Commission with clean hands and therefore the instant complaint is liable
to be dismissed.
In view of above, it is evident that the respondent has always acted in a bonafide manner and has
acted in a professional and efficient manner keeping the best interests of its consumer in sight. It is
therefore, incorrect to allege that the respondent has committed any deficiency in service. On the
other hand, it is the complainant who has filed the instant complaint as an afterthought, raising
completely false and specious allegations in order to launch a malicious prosecution against the
respondent herein and to extort illegal benefits on the basis of the same. Such illegal design of the
complainant is clearly an abuse of the process of law and is liable to be rejected.
We have heard ld. Counsel for the complainant Mr. Abhishek Singh and ld. Counsel for the Opposite
Party no.1 Mr. Pratul Pratap Singh. None appeared for the opposite parties no.2 & 3. We perused
the pleadings, evidence and documents on record.
This case has been filed under Consumer Protection Act 1986. First we have to see the aim and
object of the Consumer Protection Act.
This Consumer Protection Act covers entire goods and services of all sectors that are public, private,
or cooperative sectors, except those exempted by the central government. The act provides a floor
for a consumer where one can file their complaint against the product and the forum takes an action
against the concerned supplier and compensation is granted to the consumer for the inconvenience
he/she has encountered. The main objects of the consumer protection act are ;
To Provide better and all round protection to consumer.
To Provide machinery for the speedy redressal of the grievances.
To Create framework for consumers to seek redressal.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/19813068/ 10Mahendra Gupta vs Jai Prakash Associates Ltd on 14 September, 2022
To Provide rights to consumers.
To Safeguarde rights of Consumers.
Let us know more about the rights and responsiblities of consumer . Listed below are the Rights of
the Consumer Right to Safety- Before buying, a consumer can examine on the quality and guarantee
of the goods and opt for ISI or AGMARK products.
Right to Choose- Consumer must have the right to choose from a variety and number of goods and

and inhumane practices or exploitation of the consumer.
Listed below the responsibilities of the consumers Responsibility to be aware - A consumer has to be
careful of the safety and quality of products and services before purchasing.
Responsibility to think independently- Consumer should be well bothered about what they want and
need and hence make independent choices.
Responsibility to speak out- The buyer should be fearless to speak out their problems and tell to

The Consumer Protection Act 1986 was enacted to provide for better protection of the interests of
consumers and for that purpose to make provision for the establishment of Consumers Councils and
other authorities for the settlement of consumers' disputes and for matters connected therewith
(Preamble).
The Act Inter alia, seeks to promote and protect the rights of consumers such as --
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/19813068/ 11Mahendra Gupta vs Jai Prakash Associates Ltd on 14 September, 2022
right to be protected against marketing of goods which are hazardous to life and property;
(2) right to be informed about the quality, quantity, potency, purity, standard and price of goods to
protect the consumer against unfair trade practices;
(3) right to be assured, wherever possible, access to variety of goods at competitive prices;
(4) right to be heard and to assured that customers' interests will receive due consideration at
appropriate forums.
(5) Right to seek redressal against unfair practices or unscrupulous exploitation of consumers; and
(6) Right to consumer education The objects are sought to be promoted and protected by the
Consumer Protection Councils to be established at the Central and State levels.
The Act applies to all goods and services, except if otherwise provided by the Central Government by
Notification. To provide speedy and simple redressal of consumer disputes, a quasi judicial
machinery is set up at the District, State and Central levels. The three tier system of quasi judicial
bodies will observe the principle of natural justice and are empowered to give relief of a specific
nature and to award, wherever appropriate, compensation to consumers. Penalties for
non-compliance of the orders given by the quasi judicial bodies have also been provided.
Thus the Consumer Protection Act is to serve the interests of the consumers. Consumer education
and redressal of consumers' grievances are the two aspects of the Act. It makes good the loss a
consumer suffers and increases the feeling of responsibility of the manufacturer, trader, supplier or
businessman.
The provisions of the Act have to be construed in favor of the consumer to achieve the purpose of
enactment as it is social benefit oriented legislation. The primary duty of the Court while construing
the provisions of such an Act is to adopt a constructive approach subject to that it should not do
violence to the language of the provisions and not contrary to attempted objective of the enactment.
Extent of Consumer Protection:
While other legislations may be either punitive or preventive, the Consumer Protection Act
compensates the consumer. The provisions of the Act are in addition to and not in derogation of the
provisions of any law at the time being in force (Sec 3). In Maine Container Services South Pvt Ltd v
Go Garments 1998 (3) SCC 247 it has been held that the Contract Act applies to all litigants before
the Commissioner under the Consumers Protection Act. Passengers traveling in train suffering
injuries and loss of Jewelry as a result of assault by unruly crowd are eligible for filing of complaint
before State Commission is maintainable notwithstanding the provisions of sections 100 and 103 of
Railways Act, 1889. The Consumer Protection Act therefore gives the consumer an additional
remedy besides those which may be available under other existing laws. Existence of an arbitration
clause in the agreement is no bar to the entertainment of complaint by the Redressal Agency as the
remedy under the Act is in addition to the provisions of any other law. However, the Consumer
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/19813068/ 12Mahendra Gupta vs Jai Prakash Associates Ltd on 14 September, 2022
Forums under the Act have not taken over the jurisdiction of civil Courts. If the dispute between the
parties is pending in Civil Court no Consumer Forum will adjudicate the dispute. Similarly if
evidence be laid by the parties to the dispute is voluminous or complicated the parties will be
referred to the appropriate Civil Court.
Consumers Protection Act, thus enshrines the rights of a consumer to be informed about the quality,
quantity, potency, price etc., of the goods to be protected against unfair trade practices, to seek
inexpensive and expeditious redressal of grievances before the Consumer Forums. Consumer
Protection Act is a benevolent piece of legislation to protect a large body of consumers from
exploitation.
With the passage of time, the populace of the country is on hike and so are their opinions. Their
opinion forms the basis for their interpretation, it may be a good or a bad interpretation. What
would happen in the situation where people starting interpreting the laws? We might be flooded
with several interpretations. The interpretations will be in such huge number that the laws will
become unclear. This is the reason why lawmakers, while making the law, formulate it in accordance
with the aim, set out by them, before penning down the legislations. The aim of any legislation
defines the basis of the act. It becomes the ground norm of the act, based upon which the judiciary
interprets the disputed texts.
The aim of any act forms the indispensable element, because it acts as the cord that delivers the real
intention of the legislators behind the act. Whenever there is clash between two legislations, it is the
aim of the legislation which makes the judges to derive at the endpoint in deciding which law has the
superseding effect. It is through the doctrine of pith and substance that judges are able to derive at
the major inclination towards one act over another act. This inclination is decided on the basis of the
aim/goal of the act and the facts of that particular case.
After taking account the main objects of the Consumer Protection Act, the composite the present
case. The opposite party has objected that this flat has been taken by the complainant for the
commercial use. As per his version, the complainant has booked a flat in some scheme in his name
and now the second flat has been booked by him. After perusal it is clear that this flat has been
booked by joint name of complainant and his wife while the other was only in the name of the
complainant. It does not prove that this flat has been taken for commercial use or for reselling.
We have seen the provisional allotment letter DTD 09.05.2012 which has been issued on the
letterhead of Jaypee Greens and below there is name of Jaiprakash associates Ltd. So it is clear that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/19813068/ 13Mahendra Gupta vs Jai Prakash Associates Ltd on 14 September, 2022
the area is 167.06 m², consideration is (cid:131) 6,336,058/- and it has been directed to the complainant to
make payments of in favour of "Jaypee Sports International Limited". In this provisional allotment
letter it is also written that the possession of the said plot is expected to be delivered within a period
of 18 months here of. This provisional allotment letter has been issued jointly by Jaiprakash
Associates Ltd and Jaypee Sports International Limited. We have seen the payment demand notice
dtd 09.05.2012 issued by" Jaiprakash Associates Ltd" and in this letter the complainant has been
directed to pay in accordance with the payment plan forming part of the aforesaid Provisional
Allotment Letter. So it is clear that all the work is being handled mainly by" Jaiprakash Associates
Ltd" and later on to save their skin they formed other companies but this will not exaggerate"
Jaiprakash Associates Ltd". The amount of consideration is (cid:131) 6,336,058/- the complainant has paid
(cid:131) 5,645,418/- meaning thereby more than 80% amount has already been paid till 23.03.2013 . The
possession of the plot was to be given within 18 month but it has not been delivered after now.
Taking into consideration the date of allotment letter and after adding 18 months in it, the effective
date of delivery of possession comes 08.11.2013 .So this is the cut of date by which the possession of
the plot was to be handed over to the complainant but it has not been done and it shows clear
deficiency of service on the part of opposite parties and also it is unfair trade practice including
unfair trade contract.
The opposite parties have stated that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter of Chitra Sharma
&Ors Vs Union of India &Ors stayed the proceeding against the respondent number two.
In the light of above mentioned facts we have to see the latest judicial pronouncement of Hon'ble
NCDRC in First Appeal no 380 of 2019 , Judgement dated 26.09.22 Jaiprakash associates Ltd Vs
Deepti Kumar & two ors. In this case the matter rates to " Garden Isles" and in the present case the

months from the date of allotment while in the present case they promised to deliver the possession
within 18 months from the date of allotment letter. The Hon'ble NCDRC after discussing so many
case laws and provisions of the act, passed the judgement. So it is clear that it is a foul play of the
opposite parties that they develop a new company and then put lame excuses that the new company
will be liable for payment. When the allotment letter was issued by the opposite party, there will be
liable for giving the possession of the plot.
Now it has been established that the opposite parties are liable for the compensation and damages.
The opposite parties totally failed to carry out their promise and the complainant cannot be left
unattended for long period. There is clear defeciency on the part of the opposite parties and it is a
matter of unfair trade practice and unfair contract. What should be the amount of compensation
and what should be the rate of interest, will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case as
held by on the Supreme Court in the following judgement, Hon'ble Supreme Court has held in
Ghaziabad Development Authority Vs Balbir Singh (2004) 4 SCC 65-
"The Supreme Court, at the outset, reiterated the position taken in the case of Lucknow
Development Authority v. M.K. Gupta, and held that "the Consumer Protection Act has a wide reach
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/19813068/ 17Mahendra Gupta vs Jai Prakash Associates Ltd on 14 September, 2022
and the Commission has jurisdiction even in cases of service rendered by statutory and public
authorities". It further held that the power of the NCDRC extends to awarding compensation to
consumers for misfeasance in the public office i.e. an act which is oppressive or capricious or
arbitrary or negligent provided loss or injury is suffered by a citizen. Therefore, it upheld the appeals
filed before it to the extent that it confirmed the jurisdiction of the NCDRC to award compensation
in cases of service rendered by statutory & public authorities (the land development authorities in
the present case).
As to the issue of whether the grant of interest at the rate of 18% per annum by the NCDRC in all
cases is justifiable, the Supreme Court held in the negative. It stated that "the power to and duty to
award compensation does not mean that irrespective of facts of the case compensation can be
awarded in all matters at a uniform rate of 18% per annum." It held it to be unsustainable. The
Court further stated that the "Award of compensation must be under different separate heads and
must vary from case to case depending on the facts of each case." The purpose of awarding
compensation is to recompense for a loss or injury suffered and such compensation would therefore
be proportional to the amount of loss and injury.
While considering the compensation to be awarded to the consumers in cases of deficiency of service
by Development Authorities, the Court laid down a range of principles for the determination of the
amount of compensation, summarised below:
To award compensation, the Forum or the Commission must determine that service has been
deficient and/or misfeasance in public office which has resulted in loss or injury. While no hard and
fast rule can be laid down, the Court gave a few instances where the award of compensation would
be justifiable, including where possession is not handed over within the intimated period even
though allotment is made and the price is paid. In such cases, the loss could be determined based on
loss of rent which could have been earned if possession was given. Compensation could also be the
scheme has been canceled without any justifiable cause, after the allotment.
Compensation cannot be uniform and to illustrate this, the Court lays down the principle to be
followed for the determination of compensation in two cases- - (a) where the delivery of possession
is being directed, and (b) where only the monies are directed to be returned or refunded by the
Court. In case (a), the compensation for harassment will necessarily have to be less since in a way
the aggrieved party is being compensated by an increase in the value of the property he is getting. In
case (b) however, the party is suffering a greater loss since he has been deprived of the flat/plot, and
his expectation of delivery of possession. He would also be denied the benefit of an increase in the
value of land and the compensation thereof. Therefore, the compensation to be awarded in such
cases would have to be higher than in case (a).
The Court held that "such compensation has to be worked out after looking into the facts of each
case and after determining what is the amount of harassment/loss which has been caused to the
consumer."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/19813068/ 18Mahendra Gupta vs Jai Prakash Associates Ltd on 14 September, 2022
Compensation would include compensation for physical, mental, or even emotional suffering, insult,
or injury or loss."
"The consumer protection laws have a wide reach and the consumers are entitled to receive
compensation for deficiency in services rendered by statutory and public authorities. The Consumer
Commissions have been vested with the jurisdiction to award the value of goods or services and
compensation. On being satisfied that a complainant is entitled to compensation for loss or injury or
harassment or mental agony or oppression, it must direct the authority to pay compensation. A wide
discretion has been given to determine the quantum of compensation for any loss or damage
suffered by a consumer, to redress any injustice. However, it is a well-established principle that the
computation of compensation has to be fair, reasonable, and must reconcile with the loss or injury
suffered. The Consumer Forum is cast with the duty to take into account all relevant factors for
arriving at the compensation to be paid.
This landmark decision has set a precedent on the matter of compensation to be awarded in matters
relating to allotment of land by development authorities and has been relied upon in many
subsequent cases of the Supreme Court. In the case of H. P. Housing Board v Varinder Kumar
Garg[(2005) 9 SCC 430] and Haryana Urban Development Authority vs Darsh Kumar[(2005) 9 SCC
449], the Supreme Court directed the Commission to follow the principles laid down in the case
of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh in future cases."
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Haryana Urban Development ... vs Darsh Kumar, Etc. Etc ,
Civil Appeal no 5796 of 2002 decided on on 28 July, 2004 has held ;
"This Court has, in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh reported in
(2004) 5 SCC 65, deprecated this practice. This Court has held that interest at the rate of 18% cannot
be granted in all cases irrespective of the facts of the case. This Court has held that the Consumer
Forums could grant damages/compensation for mental agony/harassment where it finds
misfeasance in public office. This Court has held that such compensation is a recompense for the
loss or injury and it necessarily has to be based on a finding of loss or injury and must co-relate with
the amount of loss or injury. This Court has held that the Forum or the Commission thus had to
determine that there was deficiency in service and/or misfeasance in public office and that it has
resulted in loss or injury. This Court has also laid down certain other guidelines which the Forum or
the Commission has to follow in future cases.
We are informed that in spite of there being no stay, to payment of interest beyond 12% and in spite
of clarification given by this Court's order (reported in (2004) 5 SCC 65), the amounts have still not
been paid. We feel that for the lapse Appellants must pay interest at the rate of 15% from 17th
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/19813068/ 19Mahendra Gupta vs Jai Prakash Associates Ltd on 14 September, 2022
March, 2004 till payment. Appellants shall also pay costs fixed at Rs.500/- in each case to the Legal
Aid Society of the Supreme Court. The Appellants must recover the amount paid towards costs
personally from the officer/s, who were responsible for not paying even after clarification by this
Court. We clarify that this Order shall not be taken as a precedent in any other matter as the order
has been passed taking special features of the case into account. The Forum/Commission will follow
the principles laid down by this Court in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir
Singh (supra) in future cases. The Appeals are disposed off in above terms. There will be no order as
to costs."
So it is clear that the compensation and rate of interest shall depend on the facts and circumstances
of each case and no hard and fast rule can be framed. In this connection some of the judgement of
the Supreme Court and Hon'ble NCDRC should be taken into account.
In the case of PRIYANKA MITTAL & ANR. V. PARSVNATH DEVELOPERS LTD. & ANR.
(NCDRC).These appeals arise out of single order of State Commission, hence, decided by common
order. These appeals have been filed against the order dated 25.2.2015 in Complaint Nos. 18 of

Parsvnath Developers Ltd. &Anr. which complaints were partly allowed.
The Hon'ble NCDRC held that:
"Brief facts of the cases are that opposite parties/respondents are engaged in the activity of housing
construction and accordingly they have launched a project named as Parsvnath Planet situated in
Gomti Nagar, Lucknow. The project was demonstrated to be very lucrative and made attractive to
the vendees, in order to procure/collect money from the needy persons demonstrating themselves to
be excellence in the field of construction activity as compared to other builders and assured the
buyers/complainants that it has been duly approved by the Lucknow Development Authority and
necessary permission has also been obtained from them. The emphasis was made by the opposite
parties that the possession of the Unit shall be given within a scheduled period of 36+6=42 months
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/19813068/ 20Mahendra Gupta vs Jai Prakash Associates Ltd on 14 September, 2022
stipulated in agreements executed in between the parties for the project launched in the year 2006.
The complainants/appellants attracted by the promise and assurance of the opposite parties,
somehow managed and arranged the money from their personal sources as well as on loan at
attractive rate of interest and the hard earned money was paid by them to the opposite parties in a
hope that the possession of the units shall be provided to them in the year 2009 and they can leave
peacefully in their own houses, since the complainants are living in rented houses.
The complainants visited the construction site of the opposite parties after depositing the entire
amount, where it was revealed that the construction activities were on halt and the persons available
on the site told the complainants that the apartments are likely to be completed till 2015. Even the
partial construction done by the opposite parties was defective and did not match the specifications
provided in the agreement. The complainants were shocked on hearing it and observing the site. The
complainants immediately contacted the Area Manager, who told the complainants that there is
some delay in the construction of the apartment and the apartments shall be ready till June, 2010.
The complainants have to repay the amount taken on loan alongwith interest without getting the
possession of the allotted units causing irreparable loss and injury to them. The complainants have
come to know that the opposite parties have invested the funds earmarked for this project into their
other projects in other city due to which they have not been able to complete the project in time.
Besides this, it has also come to the light that although the opposite parties had collected huge funds
from the buyers but in spite of that the opposite parties have miserably failed to pay the dues of
Lucknow Development Authority which forced the Lucknow Development Authority to issue
coercive measures against the opposite parties for the recovery of their dues. Alleging deficiency on
the part of opposite parties/ respondents, complainants filed separate complaints before State
Commission. Aggrieved by the order of Hon'ble State Commission, these appeals preferred
before Hon'ble National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.
Hon'ble NCDRC discussed various case laws and after hearing the parties held, "Learned
Counsel for appellants submitted that as complainants have been deprived of possession for a long
period beyond agreed period, it amounts to restrictive trade practice under Section 2 (nnn) of
Consumer Protection Act and complainants are entitled to get compensation. Section 2 (nnn) runs
as under:- means a trade practice which tends to bring about restrictive trade practice manipulation
of price or its conditions of delivery or to affect flow of supplies in the market relating to goods or
services in such a manner as to impose on the consumers unjustified costs or restrictions and shall
include- Delay beyond the period agreed to by a trader in supply of such goods or in providing the
services which has led or is likely to lead to rise in the price; Any trade practice which requires a
consumer to buy, hire or avail of any goods, or, as the case may be, services as condition precedent
to buying, hiring or availing of other goods or services; Perusal of aforesaid provision reveals that
when opposite party delays in delivery of goods which leads to rise in the price of goods meaning
thereby, more price is charged from complainant, it amounts to restrictive trade practice. In the case
in hand, opposite party on account of delayed delivery of possession is not charging higher rate than
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/19813068/ 21Mahendra Gupta vs Jai Prakash Associates Ltd on 14 September, 2022
the agreed rate for delivery of possession of flat, so, it does not fall within the purview of restrictive
trade practice under Section 2(nnn) of Consumer Protection Act. "
"Admittedly, agreements were executed in 2006 and as per agreements, possession of flats was to be
delivered within 42 months, meaning thereby, possession was to be given in the year 2009-2010
and possession has not been handed over so far though year 2016 has started. No doubt,
complainants are entitled to get penalty amount for delayed delivery of possession as per clause 10 (
c) of the agreement but opposite party cannot be permitted to avail benefit of aforesaid clause for
indefinite period. This penalty clause should be allowed for the benefit of parties for a limited period
and in the cases in hand, I deem it appropriate to extend applicability of aforesaid clause for a
period of one year beyond 42 months and after that, complainants are certainly entitled to
compensation. Opposite party cannot be allowed to avail huge funds of complainants by paying
merely Rs. 5/- per sq. ft. for example, complainants who have purchased flat measuring 164.901 sq.
mtr., they have made payment of about Rs. 31.00 to 32 lakhs and in the garb of clause 10 (c),
opposite party is paying penalty @ approximately Rs. 9,000/- per month against enjoying funds
more than Rs. 30.00 lakhs. As complainants have been deprived to shift to their flats for a long
period which would not only have given them satisfaction of living in their own house but also have
raised their social status and opposite party has enjoyed funds of complainants for a long period, I
deem it appropriate to allow compensation @ Rs. 15,000/- p.m. to the complainants who have
applied for flats upto 175 sq. mtr and Rs. 20,000/- per month to complainants who have applied for
flats above 175 sq. after 54 months of execution of agreement till delivery of possession. "
Against this judgment, parties went to Hon'ble Supreme Court. The judgment of Hon'ble Supreme
Court is:-
In Nalin Bhargava vs. Parsvnath Developers Ltd. CA 6662/2018 @ SLP(C) 7596/2016 etc and
other related civil appeals on 13 July, 2018, Hon'ble Supreme Court held:-
"Leave granted in all the special leave petitions.CA 6662/2018 @ SLP(C) 7596/2016 etc.
It is submitted by Mr. M.L. Lahoty, learned counsel appearing for the appellants in all the appeals
that the possession has been handed over and the deficiencies have been removed and, therefore, he
has no grievance. However, Mr. Lahotywould insist that there should be imposition of costs as
compensation.
Mr. Sachin Datta, learned senior counsel appearing for the developer has raised objections with
regard to imposition of costs.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/19813068/ 22Mahendra Gupta vs Jai Prakash Associates Ltd on 14 September, 2022
Having heard learned counsel for the parties, we are of the considered opinion that the cause of
justice would be best subserved if each of the appellants in the present appeals are given
Rs.1,50,000/- (Rupees one lakh fifty thousand only) per flat, towards costs. When we say "cost", we
mean costs alone and nothing else."
These builders are just earning money from the consumers to whom they issued allotment letters
and got a huge amount. They keep this amount for a long time and earn interest on it. Property
dealing is that part of business where they never pay a penny to the consumers on their amounts
deposited for a long-term or if they pay, they pay a meagre interest of about 5% or so but they charge
18 to 24% or more if the consumers default in depositing any instalment. It reminds us the story of
"The Merchant of Venice" The Merchant of Venice is the story of a Jewish money lender Shylock
who demands that an antisemitic Christian offer "a pound of flesh" as collateral against a
loan. These acts of builders also remind us the age of Sahukari during ancient India and also during
British Raj. Whether these builders have power to frame their own law? They put their terms and
conditions in such a way that the sufferer will always be the consumer. The Consumer Protection Act
1986 has been enacted for the benefits of consumers, so the courts dealing with Consumer
Protection Act 1986 should come forward for their rescue. The courts are not governed by the
builders but they are governed by the law, Custom and Usages. Now in the background of all the
facts and also the facts of the present case, we will also discuss something more. We should also see
the objects of the Consumer Protection Act 1986."
After discussing all the facts and circumstances of the case it is clear that the opposite parties failed
to fulfil their promise and after getting the money from the complainant , failed to deliver the
possession of the plot in time. Now they have taken so many lame excuses but they are primary
responsible towards the complainant. The opposite party has stated that the complainant are
already in default and in breach of the terms of the allotment and standard terms and condition
agreed between the parties. But the person who has deposited more than 80% of the amount, cannot
be said defaulter but the defaulter is the opposite party who could not deliver the possession of the
plot in time. The condition mentioned in the allotment letter are one-sided and such conditions
cannot be binding on the complainant.
We can see highhandedness of the opposite parties. The opposite party vide letter dtd 19.03.2014 to
the complainant has said "keeping in the fact that you have failed to make the payment as per
payment plan, despite various opportunity is having been granted to you, we are constrained to
issue a final notice as per the standard terms and conditions to you to make the payment of the
amount due as on date along with interest from the respective dates the amount became due and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/19813068/ 23Mahendra Gupta vs Jai Prakash Associates Ltd on 14 September, 2022
payable. The amount due and payable as on 12.03.2014 comes to (cid:131) 1,143,189/- as per details. Hence,
by means of this letter, we hereby give you final notice to make the aforesaid payment within 30
days of the date of this notice failing which the provisional allotment shall stand cancelled."
This is purely a letter of extortion. The plot was to be delivered by 08.11.2013 and this letter has
been issued on 19.03.2014 , which shows that the opposite parties can do any thing for the benefit of
their own but there is rule of law and court of law which always comes to the rescue of the aggrieved
person. The opposite parties have never disclosed as to how much interest he will pay to the
opposite parties on the deposition from the date of their deposits. So all these rules are one-sided.
The terms and conditions made by the opposite parties are totally for their benefit and against the
principle of natural justice. After considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and also
keeping in mind the various judicial pronouncements of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and Hon'ble
NCDRC we come to conclude that the complainant is entitled for the following reliefs are against the
opposite parties jointly and severally.
The complainant is entitled to get the possession of the plot within eight weeks from the date of
judgement of this complaint case after getting sale deed executed by the opposite parties regarding
unit number P-119 , Country Homes -II at Jaypee Greens Sports City, Gautam Budh Nagar on
depositing the rest amount as per allotment letter and if the possession was not delivered to him
