COMMON ORDER
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111693457/ 3Mr.Vijay Mohan vs M/S. Real Blue International Pvt. Ltd on 15 December, 2018
The main applications, i.e., Apl.Nos.917 and 918 of 2019 were filed by one Vijay Mohan, who is the
Sole Proprietor of M/s. Agri Tech, hereinafter referred to as, 'Agri Tech' for the relief of interim
prohibitory order, prohibiting the first respondent and garnishee/respondents 2 to 5 and their men,
agents or servants from delivering the cargo of 111.472 MTs. of Raw Cashew nuts in shells packed in
four containers, under two Bills of Lading, to any other person other than the applicant, pursuant to
the Sales Contract dated 15.12.2018, pending initiation and completion of Arbitration between the
applicant and the first respondent.
A.No.918 of 2019 also filed by that Agri Tech, seeking for a direction, directing the respondents to
deliver the Cargo of 111.47 MTs. of Raw Cashew cargo in shells packed in four containers, under the
two Bills of Lading, pursuant to the Sale Contract dated 15.12.2018, to the applicant.
2. Since both these main applications i.e. A.Nos.917 and 918 of 2019 have been filed with the
aforesaid prayer by the Agri Tech, at the time of moving the said application on 31.01.2019, a
learned Judge of this Court, granted an Interim Prohibitory Order, http://www.judis.nic.in
prohibiting the respondents/garnishee/respondents 2 to 5 from releasing/delivering the goods
shipped by the second respondent to the applicant, through the third respondent, at fifth
respondent's Port at Tuticorin, India, for a period of two weeks.
3. The said interim order granted by this Court on 31.01.2019, subsequently, has been extended and
it still continued.
4. Since the said interim prohibitory order was granted by this Court on 31.01.2019, the third parties
by name, Roy Cashew Products and S.R.Cashew had approached this Court, by filing applications
seeking to implead themselves as party respondents in the main applications i.e., A.Nos.917 and 918
of 2019 on the ground that, they entered into a contract directly with the second respondent, for
importing Cashews, accordingly, the Cashews with shells had been shipped, which reached the
Tuticorin Port and before taking delivery of the goods, in view of the prohibitory interim order
passed by this Court, as stated above on 31.01.2019, they are not able to take delivery of the goods,
therefore, they are necessary parties to be heard in the main applications accordingly, they sought
for impleadment.
http://www.judis.nic.in
5. This Court, after hearing them, impleaded them as party respondents in the main applications
i.e., A.Nos.917 and 918 of 2019 as R6 [Roy Cashew] and R7 [S.R.Cashew].
6. Therefore, the R6, hereinafter referred to as 'Roy Cashew' and R7, hereinafter referred to as 'SR
Cashew' have filed applications. A.No.1636/2019 and A.No.2194/2019 had been filed by Roy
Cashew in A.No.917 of 2019 and A.No.918 of 2019 respectively, seeking to vacate the interim exparte
prohibitory order dated 31.01.2019. Like that, Roy Cashew and SR Cashew, filed two applications
i.e., A.Nos.1635 and 2195 in the main Apl.No.917 and 918 of 2019 respectively, seeking to vacate the
exparte interim prohibitory order passed by this Court on 31.01.2019. That is how, all these six
applications came to be filed.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111693457/ 4Mr.Vijay Mohan vs M/S. Real Blue International Pvt. Ltd on 15 December, 2018
7. All these applications have been heard together and are being disposed of by this common order.
8. Since the issue is mainly raised with the main applications i.e., A.Nos.917 and 918 of 2019, where
also, facts are one and the same and all parties have made submissions on those applications, if a
decision is taken in A.Nos.917 and 918 of 2019, that will cover other four applications also.
http://www.judis.nic.in
9. For the sake of convenience, the array of parties at Apl.No.917 of 2019 and the facts mentioned
therein and the documents filed by each of the parties in that application are taken into account. The
applicant in Apl.No.917 of 2019 is Agri Tech., the first respondent is M/s. Real Blue International
Private Limited hereinafter called as 'Real Blue', the second respondent is M/s.Emem Trading,
hereinafter referred to as 'Emem', the third respondent is Safmarine India Private Limited and the
fourth respondent is Maersk Line India Private Limited. Since the third and fourth respondents are
Carriers, they were called as 'Carriers' and the fifth respondent is V.O.Chidambaranar Port where,
the goods reached for discharge, hereinafter called as 'Tuticorin Port', and the sixth respondent is
'Roy Cashew' and the 7th respondent is 'SR Cashew' and they are called in that name, as stated
above.
10. The case of the applicant is that, Real Bule entered into a Sales Contract with Emem for sale of
200 MTs. of Raw Cashew nuts to be delivered from Conakry, Guinea at Tuticorin, India in
December 2018.
11.Thereafter, on 15.12.2018, the Agri Tech. entered into a back to back sales contract with Real Blue
for the purchase of http://www.judis.nic.in the said 200 MTs. of Cargo at U.S.$ 2,44,000/- and the
delivery to be made in December 2018 at Tuticorin Port, India.
12. Pursuant to the said contract, the Real Bule remitted US $ 1,12,500/- covering the value of the
said Cargo weighing 111.472 MTs. which is the subject matter of the Arbitration.
13. On 24.12.2018, the Agri Tech. remitted US $ 25,000/- to Real Blue for purchase of the said
Cargo Cashew under Contract dated 15.12.2018 and the balance amount to be paid within three
working days from the submission of original documents.
14. On 24.12.2018, Emem appropriated 111.472 MTs. of Raw Cashew nuts Cargo to the sales contract
of the Real Blue dated 13.12.2018 after payment of the full sale consideration by Real Blue towards
the said 111.472 MTs. by packing the Cargo in jute bags in a 40 foot Dry containers and removing it
for the purpose of loading.
15. On the same day, i.e., on 24.12.2018, the said containers [2 in Nos.] containing 111.472 MTs. of
Cargo appropriated towards the Sales contract of the Real Blue and the http://www.judis.nic.in
Emem was loaded on Board in the Vessel GH BRICKFIELDER belongs to the third and fourth
respondents i.e., Carriers. Therefore, the risk of the goods passes to the buyer, namely the Agri Tech
and the Real Blue as the sale is a CFR Sale. Accordingly, the carriers are the agents of the buyer, i.e.,
Real Blue as well as Agri Tech.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111693457/ 5Mr.Vijay Mohan vs M/S. Real Blue International Pvt. Ltd on 15 December, 2018
16. On 29.12.2018, the Emem sent copies of two Bills of Lading, showing the Real Blue as nominee
and the Agri Tech as notified party.
17. While so, on 16.01.2019 and 17.01.2019 the Emem had issued two original Bills of Lading with
the same BL No. to the SR Cashew and Roy Cashew, wth the same goods appropriated already by
the Emem, which act of the Emem, according to the Agri Tech, is a fraudulent act, therefore, Agri
Tech approached this Court, with the main applications i.e., A.Nos.917 and 918 of 2019 and sought
for the relief as stated therein.
18. In support of the aforementioned contentions made on behalf of the Agri Tech. [applicant], it has
filed documents such as the contract entered into between Agri Tech. and the Real Blue dated
15.12.2018 and the Sales Contract entered into between http://www.judis.nic.in Emem Trading and
Real Blue International dated 13.12.2018 signed on 14.12.2018.
19. Also the Agri Tech. filed some e-mail communications between the Carriers and the Real Blue
and the Real Blue and the Carriers dated 29.01.2019 and 30.01.2019.
20. Also the Agri Tech. filed photocopy of the copy of the Bills of Lading with BL.No.580149840 and
711519089. It is to be noted that, these two Bills of Lading are only copies and not original, i.e.,
photocopy of the original had been filed by the Agri Tech.
21. By relying upon these documents, Mr.S.Vasudevan, learned counsel appearing for the
applicant/Agri Tech, submitted that, there has been a contract between the Agri Tech. and Real Blue
before which, there was a contract between the Real Blue and Emem and in the copy of the Bill of
Lading, the shipper name has been mentioned as 'Emem Trading' on account of Real Blue
International Pvt. Limited, Singapore and it has also been mentioned in the Bills of Lading, the
applicant is a notified party. According to the Bills of Lading, the goods were shipped on Board on
29.12.2018 and 30.12.2018. The counsel would further submit http://www.judis.nic.in that,
pursuant to the contract, on 24.12.2018, a US $ 24,792/- had been paid through the Agri Tech Bank
to the Real Blue. Since this amount is the 50% advance as agreed between the Emem and Real Blue,
by Agreement dated 13.12.2018 and also the Agreement between Agri Tech, by Agreement dated
15.12.2018.
22. The remaining amount would be paid by the Agri Tech on handing over the documents and in
the meanwhile since the Carriers are the Tuticorin Port, which is the discharging place, when the
Agri Tech was ready and willing to pay the balance amount and to take delivery of the goods, it came
to know that, the original Bill i.e, Bill of Lading had not been supplied either by the Emem to the
Real Blue or by the Carriers to the Real Blue. Therefore, the Real Blue, in turn was not able to supply
the original bill of lading to the Agri Tech. and in the meanwhile, it also come to light that, some
third parties on the basis of the alleged Original Bill of Lading said to have been given by Emem,
they wanted to take delivery of the Cargo, from the Carriers and only at this juncture, the Agri Tech
approached this Court, seeking for the Prohibitory Order.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111693457/ 6Mr.Vijay Mohan vs M/S. Real Blue International Pvt. Ltd on 15 December, 2018
23. In this context, it is the further submission of the Agri Tech that, since there is an Arbitration
clause between the Agri http://www.judis.nic.in Tech and Real Blue in the Agreement dated
15.12.2018, the Agri Tech, before referring the matter to the Arbitrator, in order to save the
goods/cargo, which reached the destination and to take delivery of the same and also to prevent any
third parties from taking delivery of the Cargo, for making an interim arrangement, invoked Section
9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, hereinafter referred as 'Arbitration Act', has filed these
applications.
24. Mr.M.B.Ragavan, learned counsel for the Real Blue has infact supported the case of the Agri
Tech and would state that, there has been a contract between the Real Blue and Emem for the
supply of Cashew as stated above, and the said contract was concluded between them on 13.12.2018,
signed by the parties on 14.12.2018 and only pursuant to the said contract, the Real Blue had a back
to back contract to the Agri Tech on 15.12.2018 and pursuant to the said contract, the Agri Tech,
paid the said sum of US $ 24,972/- through its bank and the same had been paid to the Emem, who
is the seller and after having realised the said amount and after having given the copy of the Bill of
Lading, where, it has been specifically mentioned that, the goods were shipped on 29.12.2018 and
30.12.2018 under two Bills of Lading referred to above and the notified party has been shown as
Agri Tech and the Bills of Lading were issued to Emem on account of Real Blue.
http://www.judis.nic.in
25. Learned counsel for Real Blue has further argued that, once the goods have been shipped by the
seller with appropriation and the same has been handed over to the Carriers or Bailee, then, the
transaction has been completed and therefore, it became the risk of the buyer to take delivery of the
goods ofcourse, after paying the remaining amount payable to the worth of the goods/cargo.
26. In this context, the learned counsel for the Real Blue has very much relied upon certain
provisions of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 especially, Section 18, Section 23, Section 25 and Section
33 as well as Section 39.
27. Though submissions have been made by the learned counsel for the Real Blue by relying upon
these provisions of Sale of Goods Act, the learned counsel has very much relied upon the Section 23
of the Sale of Goods Act which reads thus:
"Sale of unascertained goods and appropriation.
23. (1) Where there is a contract for the sale of unascertained or future goods by
description and goods of that description and in a deliverable state are
unconditionally appropriated to the contract, either by the seller with the assent of
the buyer or by the buyer with the assent of the seller, the property in the goods
thereupon passes to the buyer. Such assent may be express or
http://www.judis.nic.in implied, and may be given either before or after the
appropriation is made.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111693457/ 7Mr.Vijay Mohan vs M/S. Real Blue International Pvt. Ltd on 15 December, 2018
(2) Delivery to carrier.—Where, in pursuance of the contract, the seller delivers the
goods to the buyer or to a carrier or other bailee (whether named by the buyer or not)
for the purpose of transmission to the buyer, and does not reserve the right of
disposal, he is deemed to have unconditionally appropriated the goods to the
contract."
28. He further submitted that, if there is a contract for sale of unascertained or future goods and it is
unconditionally appropriated to the contract, either by the seller with the assent of the buyer or by
the buyer with the assent of the seller, then the goods thereupon passes to the buyer and such
assent, may be expressed or implied. Therefore, by issuance of Bill of Lading, after shipment of the
goods on 29th and 30th December 2018, and unconditional appropriation to the contract, since it
has been established on account of Real Blue International, where, the notified party also has been
mentioned as Agri Tech, then, the goods passes to the buyer i.e., either Real Blue or Agri Tech and
therefore, the Real Blue has got every right to get discharge of the goods or take delivery of the goods
from the Carriers.
29. Per contra, Mr.K.Chandrasekaran, learned counsel appearing for the Emem has raised the
preliminary objection that, the present main applications i.e., A.Nos.917 and 918 of 2019 are
http://www.judis.nic.innot maintainable before this Court, on two grounds.
30. According to him, the first ground was that, there has been a contract between Emem and Real
Blue dated 13.12.2018 and the said contract, does not contain any Arbitration clause and if at all, any
contract between the Real Blue and Agri Tech, as claimed by them on 15.12.2018, and the said
contract between them is having an Arbitration clause, on the strength of the Arbitration Clause
available in the contract between the Agri Tech and Real Blue, the Emem cannot be brought in the
dispute and on that strength, no Arbitration Proceedings could be initiated either at the instance of
Agri Tech or at the instance of the Real Blue and when there is no scope for any Arbitration
Proceedings, absolutely, there is no scope for invocation of Section 9 of the Arbitration Act.
31. The second ground raised by the learned counsel as a preliminary objection is that, even the
contract between the Real Blue and Agri Tech dated 15.12.2018, though having an Arbitration
clause, the place of Arbitration is restricted at Singapore, that to, at Singapore International
Arbitration Center, i.e., SIAC. In this context, he relied upon the clause 18 of the Contract between
Agri Tech and Real Blue which reads thus:
" 18.Arbitration: Any dispute arising out or in connection with this contract,
including any question http://www.judis.nic.in regarding its existence, validity, or
termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration in Singapore in
accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration
Centre ('SIAC Rules') for the time being in force which rules are deemed to be
incorporated by reference into this clause."
32. Assuming without admitting that, there has been an Arbitration Agreement between the Agri
Tech and Real Blue and if at all, any dispute arises out of the said Agreement, parties can refer the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111693457/ 8Mr.Vijay Mohan vs M/S. Real Blue International Pvt. Ltd on 15 December, 2018
matter to the International Arbitration Centre i.e., SIAC that too by following SIAC Rules framed
thereunder. When that being the position, in both ways, the Agri Tech cannot maintain an
application before this Court, under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act therefore, for want of
jurisdiction, in the absence of any agreement between the parties and in the absence of any expiry,
Arbitration Agreement empowers the Courts of India and confer the jurisdiction before this Court,
these applications could not have been entertained by this Court, he contended.
33. That apart, the learned counsel for the Emem also submitted on merits of the case that, the
Emem and Real Blue has entered into a Sales Contract on 13.12.2018 accordingly, 50% of advance
amount against shipped on Board, Bill of Lading should have been paid by Real Blue for the
purchase of Raw Cashew with http://www.judis.nic.inshell, which is originated from Conakry,
Guinea for 200 MTs. He would further submit that, as per the said contract one Baiju Ganesh had
been acting as the agent of the Real Blue and it is he, who brought about the contract between the
Emem and Real Blue and as an agent of Real Blue, that Baiju Ganesh owed a sum of US $ 99,750/-
and after issuance of several emails, that Baiju Ganesh admitted the outstanding and agreed to pay
the same on or before 10.11.2018, i.e., US $ 40,000/- and on or before 17.11.2018 US $ 30,000/-
and US $ 29750/-before the first week of December. That Baiju Ganesh also agreed that, until two
payments are cleared, Emem can hold the documents, since the Real Blue has not cleared the
outstanding as admitted by his agent, the original bill of lading and other documents were given to
the first respondent and accordingly, an independent contract had been entered into between Emem
and the Roy Cashew and SR Cashew. Accordingly, the original Bills of Lading had been issued to
them, therefore, based on the copy of the Bill of Lading, without complying with their contractual
obligation on the part of the Real Blue, as has been agreed upon through their agent i.e., Baiju
Ganesh, neither the Real Blue nor the Agri Tech, can claim the Cargo.
34. In this regard, the learned counsel relied upon the paragraphs 10 of the Counter affidavit filed by
Emem which reads thus:
http://www.judis.nic.in "It is often repeated in the affidavit that the Applicant will be
put to great loss this is false. He has to work out his remedy against the 1st
respondent if the goods belonged to him but it is not so. One Mr.Baiju Ganesh has
been acting as an agent of the 1st respondent. It is he who brought about the contract
between me and 1st respondent. As an agent of 1st respondent he owned a sum of US
$ 99,750/-. After issuance of several emails, Mr.Baiju Ganesh replied that he admits
the outstanding and agreed to pay the same at US $ 40,000/- on or before
10.11.2018, US $ 30,000/- on or before 17.11.2018 and US $ 29,750/- first week of
December. He has also agreed that until two payments are cleared I can hold the
documents. Since the 1st respondent has not cleared the outstanding as admitted by
his agent the original bill of lading and other documents were not given to the 1st
respondent. The Bill of Lading split into two, the two invoices, the Certificates of
Origin and packing list etc. were issued in favour Roy Cashew Products and SR
Cashews, who have filed Bill of Entry and necessary documents for clearance and the
Customs has also cleared the Cargo and but for the order of an injunction by this
Hon'ble Court, the delivery would have been effected in favour of the concerns."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111693457/ 9Mr.Vijay Mohan vs M/S. Real Blue International Pvt. Ltd on 15 December, 2018
35. The Roy Cashews and SR Cashews, i.e., R6 and R7 filed the other four applications as stated
above, seeking to vacate the exparte interim prohibitory order, passed by this Court, on 31.01.2019.
In support of their applications, they have filed a documents set, by way of typed set of papers,
where, the Roy and http://www.judis.nic.inSR Cashews, filed a Proforma Invoice dated 22.11.2018
and it was entered into between the Emem Trading and SR Cashew for purchase of Raw Cashew
nuts with Shell of 100 MTs. and the price fixed was US $ 1,225/- per MT. total value is US $
1,22,500/-. The payment details was 15% advance and the 85% CAD i.e, Cash Against Documents.
Accordingly, on 28.11.2018, an amount of US $ 13,000 had been paid to Emem through Bank of SR
Cashews i.e., Catholic Syrian bank, Cochin. Thereafter, on 16.01.2019, Bill of lading dated
16.01.2019, was issued by carrier on behalf of Emem Trading where, the consignee name had been
mentioned as SR Cashew and the notified party name also has been shown as SR Cashew. The date
of shipment on Board was mentioned as 30.12.2018. Like that, yet another Proforma Invoice dated
03.12.2018 was filed, where, it was between Emem Trading and Roy Cashew for the purchase of
Raw Cashew nuts with shell of 110 MTs. and the rate as well as payment details etc., are one and the
same, as that of SR Cashews. Payment accordingly, was made by Roy Cashew on 10.12.2018 for a
sum of US $ 13475/- to and in favour of Emem Trading. Accordingly, Bill of lading No.580149840
was issued on 17.01.2019 and the date of shipment on Board was 29.12.2018. In respect of both SR
Cashew and Roy Cashew, the Emem Trading issued commercial invoice on 31.12.2018 and those
documents have been filed in the typed set of papers filed by SR Cashews and Roy Cashews.
http://www.judis.nic.in
36. By relying upon these documents, the learned counsel for SR Cashew and Roy Cashew submitted
that, there had been an independent contract both by SR Cashews and Roy Cashews, with Emem, by
way of Proforma Invoice or Purchase contract. In so far as SR Cashew is concerned, the contract
claimed to have been entered between them on 22.11.2018 and for Roy Cashew, the contract was
entered into on 03.12.2018. Thereafter, as per the payment terms as agreed, the amount has been
paid to Emem pursuant to which, Commercial Invoices were also issued ofcourse Original Bills of
Lading also had been issued where, in respect of SR Cashews, the Bill of Lading was issued on
16.01.2019 with BL No.711519089 and in respect of Roy Cashew Bill of Lading was issued on
17.01.2019 with BL.No.580149840.
37. The learned counsel therefore, submitted that, when there has been a clear contract between the
Emem and these Cashews separately, pursuant to which, amount as agreed between the parties had
been paid in advance and the remaining amount would be paid at the time of production of
document i.e., CAD [Cash against documents] and the goods have been shipped on 29th and 30th of
December 2018 and the Original Bills of Lading had been issued on 16.01.2019 and 17.01.2019
respectively, therefore, with http://www.judis.nic.in the strength of all these documents, when the
Roy Cashew and SR Cashews were about to make the remaining payment and to take delivery of the
goods, from the carrier, which reached at the Tuticorin Port, they came to know that, a Prohibitory
Injunction order has been passed by this Court, in the main applications filed by Agri Tech and
therefore, they approached this Court, for getting impleaded themselves and after getting
impleaded, have filed these applications, to vacate the Prohibitory Order passed by this Court on
31.01.2019, in the main applications.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111693457/ 10Mr.Vijay Mohan vs M/S. Real Blue International Pvt. Ltd on 15 December, 2018
38. Also Mr.P.Giridharan, learned counsel for the third and fourth respondents/Carriers has filed
documents and made submissions that, the third and fourth respondents have issued Booking
confirmation Note, where, the Bill number corresponding to the Bill of Lading has been given on
27.12.2018 where, it has been mentioned that, the booking party is Emem Trading and the Price
Owner is Emem Trading. The original Bill of Lading dated 16.01.2019 and 17.01.2019 has been
issued only in favour of Roy Cashew and SR Cashew as consignee/notified party and once the goods
reached the discharging port at Tuticorin, the carriers cannot retain the goods, when the consignee
seek of delivery of the same on production of Original documents, either it will hand over the goods
to the Carrier with penalty as well as demurrage and those http://www.judis.nic.in amounts are
being charged by the Port, will mount burden on the Carrier and therefore, the Prohibitory order
passed by this Court on 31.01.2019 has to be vacated and the carrier shall be permitted to deliver the
goods to the consignee, which is having valid document.
39. In this regard, the learned counsel further submitted that, on 26.01.2019 cargo arrived, notices
have been issued, despite the same, Roy Cashew or SR Cashew could not take delivery of the goods
because of the Prohibitory Order passed by this Court, therefore, the said order may be vacated at
the earliest.
40. I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties, who made a detailed submissions
supporting their respective cases.
41. Since three issues were raised legally in these applications, which are to be decided by this Court
in the given facts and circumstances of the case, ofcourse, by taking the judicial prudence sought for,
by the learned respective counsel.
42. The first issue raised by the learned counsel for the parties except Agri Tech and Roy Cashew
was that, these applications are not maintainable before this Court, as Section 9
http://www.judis.nic.in cannot be invoked by the Agri Tech in the absence of any Arbitration
Agreement between the parties.
43. In order to dwell into these issues, let me take first, as to whether this Court has got jurisdiction,
to entertain Section 9 application or not.
44. As per the document filed by the parties, there has been a Sales Contract/Agreement between
Emem and Real Blue dated 13.12.2018. However, the said Sales Contract does not have any
Arbitration Clause.
45. However, in the agreement between Agri Tech and Real Blue dated 15.12.2018 under Clause 18
there is an Arbitration Clause under which, any dispute arisen in connection with the contract, it
shall be referred to and to be finally resolved by Arbitration in Singapore in accordance with the
Singapore International Arbitration Center Rules.
46. Therefore, it is quiet clear that, there has been no Arbitration Agreement between Agri Tech,
with any other party herein except the Real Blue, even in the said Arbitration clause containing in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111693457/ 11Mr.Vijay Mohan vs M/S. Real Blue International Pvt. Ltd on 15 December, 2018
the contract between them, the place of Arbitration is http://www.judis.nic.in restricted at
Singapore and the Rules to be followed in the Arbitration Proceedings is SIAC Rules.
47. In this context, learned counsel made submissions stating that, under Section 2(2) of the
Arbitration Act, where, the first part will apply in respect of the Arbitration to be conducted outside
India. In this context, they relied upon very much Section 2(2) of the Arbitration Act, which reads
thus:
" (2) This part shall apply where the place of arbitration is in India:
[Provided that subject to an agreement to the contrary, the provisions of Sections 9,
27 and clause (a) of sub-section (1) and sub-section (3) of section 37 shall also apply
to international commercial arbitration, even if the place of arbitration is outside
India, and an arbitral award made or to be made in such place is enforceable and
recognised under the provisions of Part II of this Act."
48. Section 9 of the Arbitration Act provides that, any party before or during the Arbitration
Proceedings or at any rate, after making of the Arbitral Award, before it is enforced in accordance
with Section 36, that too, a Court, by making interim arrangement, which includes a interim
injunction or appointment of receiver under Section 9(1) (ii)(d) of the Act. http://www.judis.nic.in
49. Learned counsel for Emem has very much relied upon SIAC Rules 2016, especially Rule 30,
which reads thus:
"Rule 30: Interim and Emergency Relief:
30.1 The Tribunal may, at the request of a party, issue an order or an Award granting
an injunction or any other interim relief it deems appropriate. The Tribunal may
order the party requesting interim relief to provide appropriate security in
connection with the relief sought.
30.2 A party that wishes to seek emergency interim relief prior to the constitution of
the Tribunal may apply for such relief pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Schedule 1.
30.3 A request for interim relief made by a party to a judicial authority prior to the
constitution of the Tribunal, or in exceptional circumstances thereafter, is not
incompatible with these Rules."
50. By relying upon Rule 30 of the SIAC Rules, the learned counsel for Emem submits that, if at all
any interim arrangement to be made or sought for, the same shall be made before the International
Arbitration Center at Singapore and not before this Court, invoking Section 9 of the Act. He would
also submit that, in the absence of any contract between the Emem and Agri Tech, the Agri Tech
cannot invoke Section 9 of the Arbitration Act, as the Agri Tech cannot also refer the matter for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111693457/ 12Mr.Vijay Mohan vs M/S. Real Blue International Pvt. Ltd on 15 December, 2018
Arbitration in order to resolve the dispute between Agri Tech and other roping the
http://www.judis.nic.in Emem. In this context, the learned counsel for the Emem also submit that,
it is not a Garshinee as claimed by the Agri Tech and it is the seller which had independently entered
into a contract with Real Blue and also entered into separate contract with Roy Cashew and SR
Cashew and therefore, in order to vary the terms of said contract only, parties entered into between
the said contract to entertain the same, as admittedly, there is no privity of contract between Agri
Tech and Emem. In support of this contention, the learned counsel for Emem, relied upon the
judgment of the Honourable Supreme Court reported in 1966 (2) SCR 845 where, the learned
counsel relied upon the paragraphs 3 and 4 of the said judgments.
51. However, in order to meet the said contention, the learned counsel for Emem, the learned
counsel for Agri Tech relied upon the following decisions:
1) Wheels India Limited having its Registered Officer at 37, Mount Road, Madras-6
vs. Khemchand Rajkumar and another [C.S.No.219 of 1966] reported in 1970 MLJ
648;
2) Bhatia International vs. Bulk Trading S.A. and Another reported in 2002 (4) SCC
http://www.judis.nic.in 105;
3) Raffles Design International India Prvt. Ltd. and another vs. Educomp
Professional Education Limited & Others reported in 2016 SCC Online Del. 5521;
52. In the first judgment i.e., 1970 MLJ 648, the learned counsel has relied upon the following
passage:
"Issue No. 7.--The point for consideration is whether this Court has jurisdiction to try
the suit. The second defendant is admittedly a foreign company carrying on business
and having its office in the United States of America and is not in the usual course
liable to the jurisdiction of the Madras High Court : but it is well-settled international
law that, where a foreign company had chosen to appear before the Court of another
Country and also to plead on the merits of the case, the foreign company must be
deemed to have voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of this Court, though the
company had also raised a plea that the Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit
against it. Venkataraman, J., has, in Anant Narayan v. Massey Ferguson Ltd. (1965) 1
Comp. L.J. 269 : (1965) 1 M.L.J. : 550, had affirmed the said principle and had
elaborately set out the relevant passages from the text books Private International
Law by Cheshire and Dicey's Conflict of Laws and the various decisions both English
and Indian on this aspect. Dicey has stated at page 171 of his book that the Court has
jurisdiction in an action where any person who has by his conduct precluded himself
from objecting to the http://www.judis.nic.in jurisdiction of the Court and the rule is
based on the principle of submission. This rule is recognised as stated above by the
decision of Venkataraman, J., in Anant Narayan v. Massey Ferguson Ltd. (1965) 1
Comp. L.J. 269 : (1965) 1 M.L.J. : 550, as well as in the two earlier decisions of this
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111693457/ 13Mr.Vijay Mohan vs M/S. Real Blue International Pvt. Ltd on 15 December, 2018
Court : Ramanathan Chettiar v. Kalimuthu Pillai (1914) I.L.R. 37 Mad. 163, and Rama
Ayyar v. Krishna Pattar (1916) 30 M.L.J. 148 : I.L.R. 39 Mad. 733. Admittedly, in the
present instance, the second defendant had appeared before this Court and pleaded
on the merits and there is therefore no substance in the issue that this Court has no
jurisdiction to entertain the suit. The issue is answered accordingly."
53. In Bhatia International's case, the learned counsel relied upon the following paragraphs:
"31. If a party cannot secure, before or during the pendency of the arbitral
proceedings, an interim order in respects of items provided in Section 9(i) & (ii) the
result may be that the arbitration proceedings may themselves get frustrated e.g. by
non appointment of a guardian for a minor or person of unsound mind or the subject
matter of the arbitration agreement not being preserved. This could never have been
the intention of the Legislature.
32. To conclude we hold that the provisions http://www.judis.nic.in of Part I would
apply to all arbitrations and to all proceedings relating thereto. Where such
arbitration is held in India the provisions of Part I would compulsory apply and
parties are free to deviate only to the extent permitted by the derogable provisions of
Part I. In cases of international commercial arbitrations held out of India provisions
of Part I would apply unless the parties by agreement, express or implied, exclude all
or any of its provisions. In that case the laws or rules chosen by the parties would
prevail. Any provision, in Part I, which is contrary to or excluded by that law or rules
will not apply."
54. In 2016 SCC Online Del. 5521, the learned counsel relied upon the paragraphs 100 which reads
thus:
"The SIAC Rules are clearly in conformity with the UNCITRAL Model Law and permit the parties to
approach the Court for interim relief. As pointed out earlier, UNCITRAL Model Law expressly
provides for courts to grant interim orders in aid to proceedings held outside the State. And, the
proviso to Section 2 (2) of the Act also enables a party to have recourse to Section 9 of the Act
notwithstanding that the seat of arbitration is outside India. Thus, the inescapable conclusion is that
since the parties had agreed that the arbitration be conducted as per SIAC Rules, they had impliedly
agreed that it would not be incompatible for them to approach the Courts for interim relief. This
would also include the Courts other than Singapore. It is relevant to mention that IAA is based on
UNCITRAL http://www.judis.nic.in Model Law and SIAC Rules are also complimentary to
IAA/UNCITRAL Model law."
55. On perusal of these decisions, two things are clear. One is that, as per Section 2 (ii) of the
Arbitration Act part (i) of the Act would apply to all Arbitrations and all Proceedings. If such
Arbitration is held in India, the provisions of part one would completely apply and in case of
International Commercial Arbitration held outside India, provisions of part (ii) would apply unless,
the purpose of agreement exclude all or any of the provisions.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111693457/ 14Mr.Vijay Mohan vs M/S. Real Blue International Pvt. Ltd on 15 December, 2018
56. Secondly, when there is SIAC Rules and Clause 18 of the Agreement between the Agri Tech and
Real Blue restricts that the place of Arbitration is only Singapore and the SIAC Rules would apply
and in the SIAC Rules, especially, under Rule 30, no interim arrangement has to be made, parties
can approach only the Tribunal at Singapore where under Schedule-I, by appointing Emergency
Arbitrator, interim arrangement can be made even before the matter is referred to Arbitrator, where
such an interim arrangement can be sought for before this Court by invoking Section 9 of the Act.
http://www.judis.nic.in
57. The answer is very simple because, Clause iii of Rule 30 of SIAC Rules, makes it very clear that, a
request for interim relief made by any party to judicial authority even prior to the constitution of the
Tribunal or in exceptional circumstances thereafter, such an interim relief sought for by the party is
not in compatible with the SIAC Rules.
58. Therefore, it makes unambiguously clear that, even though SIAC Rules is very exhaustive where,
any party can approach the SIAC for interim Arbitrator, even for making interim order/interim
arrangements, notwithstanding the same, if any party with a request of the interim relief approach
the judicial authority even prior to the constitution of the Tribunal or even thereafter, in case of the
exceptional circumstances, such approach, cannot be considered to be in compatible with the Rules.
59. Here in the case in hand there is an Arbitration Agreement between the Agri Tech and Real Blue
and as per Clause 18 of the Agreement, issues can be referred to International Arbitration Center at
Singapore and the SIAC Rules alone, will be applicable. However, before constitution of the Arbitral
Tribunal at Singapore, the party can approach Judicial Authority means, Law Courts, such
approach, cannot be treated as incompatible with the Rules. There is no embargo or prohibition
under the SIAC Rules http://www.judis.nic.in against any party of the Arbitration Agreement to
approach Courts of Law/ Judicial Authority, seek for interim relief, even prior to the constitution of
the Tribunal.
60. Therefore, the SIAC Rules does not prohibited the Agri Tech to approach this Court, by filing
Section 9 Application. This in fact has been made very clear by the Delhi High Court in Raffles
Design International India Pvt. Limited's case vide paragraphs 10 and 11, which has already been
extracted herein above.
61. The other objection raised by Emem was that, since there has been no Arbitration Agreement
between Emem and Agri Tech, whether the Agri Tech is right to invoke Section 9 and file these
applications seeking Prohibitory Order against Emem also.
62. In this context, it is to be noted that, Section 9 especially under Section 9(1)(ii)(d) interim
injunction can be sought for, by the party as an interim measure, before the Court of Law. Here in
the case in hand, the Cargo is being claimed by two parties, one is Agri Tech another is SR Cashew in
respect of one set of Cargo and Roy Cashew in respect of another set of Cargo and in that
circumstances, Agri Tech approached this Court, seeking for http://www.judis.nic.in Prohibitory
Injunction under Section 9(1)(ii)(d) and this kind of interim measure can be asked by any of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111693457/ 15Mr.Vijay Mohan vs M/S. Real Blue International Pvt. Ltd on 15 December, 2018
party, by approaching the judicial forum/Court of Law, strictly by invoking Section 18 of the
Arbitration Agreement between the Agri Tech and Real Blue. Therefore, such a invocation of Section
9 of Agri Tech against Real Blue, cannot be termed to be outside the scope of Arbitration and
therefore, this Court, prima facie finds that, invocation of Section 9 of the Agri Tech is sustainable.
63. At the same time, since there is no privity of contract between Agri Tech and Emem and even the
contract between the Real Blue and Emem does not contain any Arbitration Clause, whether Emem
can be roped in these proceedings, is yet another question.
64. In this context, it is the case of the Agri Tech that, Emem has been shown only as guarantor and
since the goods have already been appropriated in the name of the Agri Tech as per the Bill of
Lading [Copy of Bill of Lading], the Agri Tech claimed right over the Cargo for taking delivery,
where the Emem has only been shown as Garnishee along with Carriers. Therefore, these
applications can be maintained before this Court and in view of the aforesaid judgments, especially,
in the context of Section 2(ii) of http://www.judis.nic.in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, this
Court has got jurisdiction to entertain this application for making interim arrangement strictly
within Section 9, especially, under Section 9(1)(ii)(d) of the Arbitration Act and therefore, this Court
finds the issue of jurisdiction of this Court, for entertaining these applications in favour of the
applicant i.e., Agri Tech.
65. On the side of the merits of the case is concerned, though the learned counsel for the Agri Tech
as well as Real Blue made a unified submissions that, once the agreement had been entered into
between the Real Blue and Emem, pursuant to which, further agreement had been entered into
between the Real Blue and Agri Tech and both these agreements had been made only to purchase
the Cashews i.e., Raw Cashews from the seller i.e., Emem by the buyer i.e., Real Blue in turn, from
the buyer Agri Tech and these factors have been reflected in these two agreements between the
parties dated 13.12.2018 and 15.12.2018 and also, the same have been reflected in the two Bills of
Lading where, it has been specifically mentioned on account of Real Blue, the Bill of Lading was
issued, where, the Agri Tech has been shown as notified party, the Agri Tech is entitled to get
delivery of the Cargo, whether the said exercise was possible, that to, by way of an interim
arrangement by this Court, is yet another question on merits to be http://www.judis.nic.in decided,
in these applications.
66. In support of their case, i.e., the case of the Agri Tech and Real Blue, the learned counsel relied
upon Section 23 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, which has already been extracted herein above.
67. In this context, the learned counsel relied upon the decision in Carona Sahu Co., Pvt. Ltd., vs
State of Maharashtra reported in 1966 (2) SCR 845: AIR 1966 SC 1153 where, they very much relied
upon the paragraphs 3 and 4 which reads thus:
"3. The first question that arises for determination in this case is, whether, on the
facts and circumstances of the case, the property in the rubber consignments passed
to the appellant in Cochin i.e. outside the territorial limits of the State of Bombay. In
this connection the facts found by the Sales Tax Tribunal are that the Cochin sellers
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111693457/ 16Mr.Vijay Mohan vs M/S. Real Blue International Pvt. Ltd on 15 December, 2018
had their agents in Bombay who received the orders of the appellant and arranged for
the shipping of the goods. In accordance with these orders the goods were shipped by
the Cochin sellers from Cochin to Bombay. The Bills of Lading were in the name of
the sellers as consignors and consignees. The invoices however showed that the goods
were shipped at the “risk and on account of M/s Carona Shau and Company (P) Ltd.”
The insurance charges were borne by the appellant who also paid freight and other
http://www.judis.nic.in charges. The Bills of Lading were sent by the sellers through
the bank to be delivered to the buyers in Bombay on payment of the price of the
goods. In view of these facts, the High Court held that the property was intended by
the parties to pass in Bombay and the endorsement in the invoice that the goods were
being shipped “on account of and at the risk of the buyers” did not mean anything
more than that the insurance charges were to be paid by the buyers. On behalf of the
appellant, Mr Donde submitted that the property in the rubber consignments had
passed to the appellants in Cochin. In our opinion, there is no warrant for this
submission aid the view taken by the High Court is correct.
4. The law is well established that in the case of contract for sale of unascertained
goods the property does not pass to the purchaser unless there is unconditional
appropriation, of the goods in a deliverable state to the contract. In the case of such a
contract, delivery of the goods by the vendor to the common carrier is an
appropriation sufficient to pass the property. But there is a difference in the legal
effect of delivering goods to a common carrier on the one hand and shipment on
board a ship under a bill of lading on the other hand, where goods are delivered on
board of a vessel to be carried, and a bill of lading is taken, the delivery by the seller is
not delivery to the buyer, but to the captain as bailee for delivery to the person
indicated by the bill of lading. The seller may therefore take the bill of lading to his
own order. The effect of this transaction is to control the possession of the captain
and make the captain accountable to deliver the goods to the seller as the holder of
the bill of lading. The bill of lading is the symbol of property, http://www.judis.nic.in
and by so taking the bill of lading the seller keeps to himself the right of dealing with
property shipped and also the right of demanding possession from the captain, and
this is consistent even with a special term that the goods are shipped on account of
and at the risk of the buyer. In Gabarron v. Kreeft [(1875) LR 10 Ex 274] Lord Parker
laid down the principle as follows:
“The English cases, however, on which the Sale of Goods Act was founded seem to
show that the appropriation would not be such as to pass the property if it appears or
can be inferred that there was no actual intention to pass it. If the seller takes the bill
of lading to his own order and parts with it to a third person, not the buyer, and that
third person, by possession of the bill of lading, gets the goods, the buyer is held not
to have the property so as to enable him to recover from the third party,
notwithstanding that the act of the seller was a clear breach of the contract.” Sections
23 and 25 of the Indian Sale of Goods Act are identical in language to the
corresponding provisions of the English Sale of Goods Act. Section 25 states as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111693457/ 17Mr.Vijay Mohan vs M/S. Real Blue International Pvt. Ltd on 15 December, 2018
follows:
“(1) Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods or where goods are
subsequently appropriated to the contract, the seller may, by the terms of the
contract or appropriation, reserve the right of disposal of the goods until certain
conditions are fulfilled. In such case, notwithstanding the delivery of the goods to a
buyer, or to a carrier or other bailee for the purpose of transmission to the buyer, the
property in the goods does not pass to the buyer until the conditions imposed by the
seller are fulfilled. http://www.judis.nic.in (2) Where goods are shipped and by the
bill of lading the goods are deliverable to the order of the seller or his agent, the seller
is prima facie deemed to reserve the right of disposal."
68. They also relied upon the Division Bench Judgement of Allahabad High Court, in the case of
Hindustan Lever Ltd., and another vs. State of U.P. and Others reported in 1999 SCC Online
Allahabad 191, paragraphs 27 to 29 of the said judgement reads thus:
" 27. A perusal of Section 4(3) clearly indicates that for a sale to take place, there
must be a transfer of property. As to when the transfer of property takes, we have to
go to Chapter III of the Sale of Goods Act. Section 18. which is contained in Chapter
Hi, states "where there is a contract for the sale of unascertained goods, no property
in the goods is transferred to the buyer unless and until the goods are ascertained".
Section 19 of the Sale of Goods Act states "(1) Where there is a contract for the sale of
specific or ascertained goods, the property in them is transferred to the buyer at such
time as the parties to the contract intend it to be transferred. (2) For the purpose of
ascertaining the intention of the parties regard shall be had to the terms of the
contract, the conduct of the parties and the circumstances of the case. (3) Unless a
different intention appears, the rules contained in Sections 20 to 24 are rules for
ascertaining the intention of the parties as to the time at which the property in goods
is to pass to the buyer". Section http://www.judis.nic.in 20 of the Sale of Goods Act
states "where there is an unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods in a
deliverable state, the property in the goods passes to the buyer when the contract is
made and it is immaterial whether the time of payment of the price or the time of
delivery of goods, or both, is postponed." Section 23 of the Sale of Goods Act states
"(1) Where there is a contact for the sale of unascertained or future goods by
description and goods of that description and in a deliverable state are
unconditionally appropriated to the contract, either by the seller with the assent of
the buyer or by the buyer with the assent of the seller, the property in the goods
thereupon passed to the buyer. Such assent may be express or implied, may be given
either before or after the appropriation is made, (2) where, in pursuance of the
contract, the seller delivers goods to the buyer or to a carrier or other bailee (whether
by the buyer or not) for the purpose of transmission to the buyer, and does not
reserve the right of disposal, he is deemed to have unconditionally appropriated the
goods to the contract.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111693457/ 18Mr.Vijay Mohan vs M/S. Real Blue International Pvt. Ltd on 15 December, 2018
28. The expression specific goods has been defined in Section 2(14) of Sale of Goods
Act to mean "goods identified and agreed upon at the time a contract of sale is made".
29. The facts of the present case reveal that what is transferred from the factory to the Company
Depots (where the C and F Agents are located) are unascertained goods and not ascertained goods.
The goods becomes ascertained only after out of A.W.C. 108 the stock lying with the C and F
http://www.judis.nic.in Agent at the depot certain specifications out of the stock are separated for
being sold. To give illustration, suppose there are 10,000 tins of ghee lying at the depot with the C
and F Agents. If an order of 100 tins of ghee are received, then it is only when out of this stock of
10,000 tins of ghee (which are unascertained goods). 100 specific tins are taken out of the stock.
Under Section 23(1) of the Sale of Goods Act. it is only when these specific 100 tins are appropriated
to the contract that the sale takes place. Under Section 23(2). it is when the C and F Agents delivers
these 100 specific tins to the carrier (which may be a truck or otherwise), goods can be said to be
unconditionally appropriated to the contract. These provisions clearly show, that the exact point of
time when the sale takes place is when the C and F Agents deliver certain specific tins of ghee to the
carrier (truck or otherwise) which is meant for carrying the goods to the purchaser. Thus sales take
place at the depot of the C and F Agents because it is at the moment of handing over the goods to the
carrier for transportation to the buyer that the appropriation of the goods to the contract (i.e., the
sale) takes place. It may be noted that Section 18 to the Sale of Goods Act makes it clear that there is
no question of transfer of unascertained goods. The transfer can only be of ascertained goods. In the
present case, the goods which are transported from the factory are unascertained goods because out
of the total stock being carried in the truck from the factory, it is not clear which particular tins are
being sold to which particular buyer. The facts of the present case clearly show that in fact
unascertained goods are carried from the factory to the depots, and it is only at the depot that out of
the stock certain specific tins are separated on, http://www.judis.nic.in receiving order from the
redistribution stockist for sale of those specific tins."
69. They also relied upon, 2009(6) SCC 52 in the matter of Commissioner of Central Exercise, Noida
vs Accurate Meters Limited. The relevant paragraph, they relied upon is para 16, which reads thus:
"16. In Associated Strips Ltd. v. CCE [Associated Strips Ltd. v. CCE, (2002) 143 ELT
131 (Tri) : (2002) 49 RLT 506] the Tribunal distinguishing its earlier decision in CCE
v. Prabhat Zarda Factory Ltd. [(2000) 119 ELT 191 (Tri)] , held: (Associated Strips
Ltd. case [Associated Strips Ltd. v. CCE, (2002) 143 ELT 131 (Tri) : (2002) 49 RLT
506] , ELT pp. 138-39, paras 18-19) “18. In the case of Associated Strips Ltd. the
goods manufactured are inspected by the representative of the buyer (Electricity
Board) and thereafter the manufacturer had to mark the name of the buyer on the
poles before they are handed over to the transporter. So also in the case of Mauria
Udyog Ltd. the LPG cylinders manufactured by the appellant are inspected by the
representatives of the oil companies. After getting test certificate from the Bureau of
Indian Standards cylinders are to be marked with the name of the oil companies
before they are handed over to the transporter for the purpose of transmission to the
buyer. In the light of the provisions contained in Section 23, it has to be taken that
the goods are unconditionally appropriated to the contract when the above procedure
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111693457/ 19Mr.Vijay Mohan vs M/S. Real Blue International Pvt. Ltd on 15 December, 2018
was followed and goods handed over to the carrier thus passing on the property in
the goods to the buyer.
19. We may also refer to the provisions contained under Section 39 of the Sale of Goods Act which
refers to the legal effect of delivery of the goods to a carrier by the seller. It is provided that where, in
pursuance of a contract of sale, the seller is authorised or required to send the goods to the buyer,
delivery of the goods to a carrier, whether named by the buyer or not, for the purpose of
transmission to the buyer, is prima facie deemed to be a http://www.judis.nic.in delivery of the
goods to the buyer (Bibhuti Bhusan Bose v. National Coal Trading Co. [AIR 1966 Pat 346] ).
Admittedly, in the present cases after appropriation of the goods to the contract they were delivered
to the carrier as per terms of the contract. Therefore, delivery to the carrier has to be taken as
delivery to buyer. Revenue has no case that the goods are not sent to the buyer through carrier. On
the other hand, as mentioned earlier, the only contention raised is that since the insurance of the
goods in transit has been taken by the seller, the seller is deemed to hold the title to the goods in
transit. At this juncture we may point out that in the case of Mauria Udyog Ltd. there is no insurance
taken by the seller.”
70. By relying upon these decisions, in the context of Section 23 of the Sale of Goods Act, the learned
counsel for the Agri Tech and Real Blue submitted that, once the goods were appropriated
unconditionally by the seller, with the consent of buyer, then the right of the goods have been passed
by the buyer, who shall be at liberty to take delivery of the goods, at the discharging point.
71. This Court, on perusal of these decisions referred to above is of the considered view that,
absolutely there can be no quarrel on the Principles enunciated in this context, especially, in the
context of Section 23 of the Sale of Goods Act.
72. However, the fact remains here that, the appropriation as claimed by Real Blue as well as Agri
Tech from http://www.judis.nic.in Emem was, whether unconditionally or not is the subject matter
to be decided only by the Arbitrator or by the competent Court.
73. The reason being that, though the Agri Tech and Real Blue submitted a copy of the Bill of
Lading, the very same Bill of Lading with original had been issued only in the name of Roy Cashew
and SR Cashew. It is also claimed by Emem that, no doubt there had been an Agreement between
the Real Blue and Emem and at the same time, there had been a separate agreement between the
Roy Cashew as well as SR Cashew, it is the further case of the Emem that, as agreed by Real Blue
through its agent, the amount as agreed had not been passed on. Therefore, the Emem claimed that,
they retained the right of issuance of original document till the amount is realised, therefore, in this
context, it is the case of the Emem that, they have not realised the original document, authorising
either the Real Blue or Agri Tech, to take delivery of the goods, even though it has been shipped as
early as on 29th and 30th of December 2018. Thereafter, the original Bill of Lading was issued in
favour of SR Cashew and Roy Cashew on 16.01.2019 and 17.01.2019 and the copy of the Bill of
Lading, filed by the Agri Tech as well as the Roy Cashew does discloses any date of issue, neither the
said copy of the Bill of Lading does contain signature of the Emem or the Carriers. Therefore, it
cannot be said http://www.judis.nic.in that the seller i.e, Emem unconditionally appropriated the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111693457/ 20Mr.Vijay Mohan vs M/S. Real Blue International Pvt. Ltd on 15 December, 2018
goods to and in favour of the buyer i.e., Real Blue or Agri Tech.
74. Only in the context, whether the goods are unconditionally appropriated to the contractor either
by the seller with the assent or with the buyer with the assent of the Seller, the appropriation of the
goods thereupon passes to the buyer. Here in the case in hand, based on the document available
before this Court, it cannot be given a conclusive finding that, the goods have been unconditionally
appropriated to the contractor either by the seller with the assent of the buyer or by the buyer with
the assent of the seller. Moreover, there is no direct contract between the Agri Tech and Emem
whereas, there has been a direct contract both between Roy Cashew as well as SR Cashew with
Emem pursuant to which, original Bill of Lading had been issued in their name and they have been
shown as notified party and they have also paid the agreed amount as per the contract with Emem
and the goods have also been reached the Port where, it is ready for delivery or discharge on
payment of the remaining amount or production of documents. Here in the case in hand, since the
Original Bill of Lading is available only with the SR Cashew and Roy Cashew, the principle
enunciated under Section 23 of Sale of Goods Act, in the opinion of this Court, has been complied
with are in favour of only http://www.judis.nic.in SR Cashew or Roy Cashew atleast prima facie and
not in favour of either for Agri Tech or for Real Blue.
75. In that circumstances, what has to be done has also been considered in a similar circumstance by
a Division Bench of this Court, in the matter of Glints Global PTE Ltd., and another vs. EISA
Trading Inc., and others reported in 2014 SCC Online Madras 381, where, in a similar circumstance,
the Division Bench has made the following observation;
"9. Thus, the controversy narrows down to the question - who is to have the
proprietary right over the cargo - whether the holder of the draft bill of lading or the
holder of the original bill of lading.
10. The learned Single Judge had gone into this moot question and referring to
Section 30 of the Sale of Goods Act, concluded that unless the goods are appropriated
by the seller with the consent of the buyer or the buyer with the consent of the seller,
the proprietary rights over the goods will not pass. In the present case, since such a
situation is not in favour of the appellants, the learned Single Judge taking note of the
prima facie evidence produced by the fourth respondent in the form of original bill of
lading, held that there is no prima facie case in favour of the appellants, namely, the
title over the goods, and thus refused injunction and also directed the fourth
respondent to take delivery of the cargo in pursuance of the original bill of lading,
however, after spaying the detention charges.
11. A suit itself shall not be tried in an injunction application itself. The issues relating
to the proprietary http://www.judis.nic.in rights based on the draft bill of lading or
the original bill of lading is to be decided by the trial Court. It is needless to say that
the appellants will always have their claim with the first respondent or the original
seller. It is pertinent to note that there is no privity of contract as between the
appellants and the fourth respondent. The issue whether the fourth respondent is a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111693457/ 21Mr.Vijay Mohan vs M/S. Real Blue International Pvt. Ltd on 15 December, 2018
bona fide purchaser for value or is there any collusion or fraud practiced upon, and
jurisdiction question are matters to be decided by the trial Court.
12. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the fourth respondent fairly submits
that taking delivery of the cargo in pursuance of the interim order passed by the
learned Single Judge is always subject to the result of the suit.
13. In view of the foregoings, recording the said submission of the learned Senior
Counsel, this Original Side Appeal is disposed of. Consequently, the order of the
learned Single Judge is confirmed and the fourth respondent is entitled to take
delivery of the containers after payment of necessary charges. No costs.
Consequently, M.P. No. 1 of 2014 is closed."
76. There also only interim relief sought for by a buyer claimed to have been only prior to Bill of
Lading and such interim relief was lapsed and the 4th respondent in that case, who was having the
original Bill of Lading was given permission to take delivery of the goods and when the same was
appealed to the Division Bench, the Division Bench after having taken note of the factual matrix had
observed that, the interim relief granted by the http://www.judis.nic.in learned Judge in favour of
the fourth respondent, who is having the original Bill of Lading, was to be justified and the
appellant, who had only the draft Bill of Lading, was not entitled to get the relief. Ofcourse, the
interim relief granted was subject to the decision to be finally made in the suit.
77. Here in the case in hand, whatever order to be passed by this Court, in these applications by way
of interim arrangement, ofcourse, under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act is subject to the outcome of
the decision or whether to be made or passed by the Arbitral Tribunal i.e., International Arbitration
Center at Singapore and till such award is passed, no conclusive decision can be taken by this Court.
78. Therefore, taking clue from the said Division Bench Judgement in Glints Globle case referred to
above, this Court is of the considered view that, those who are having the original document i.e.,
original Bill of Lading would be prima facie entitled to take delivery of the goods. However, such
permission granted to the holder of the Original document would definitely be subject to the
outcome of the decision to be made by the Arbitral Tribunal at Singapore before whom, the issue
can very well be referred for final adjudication.

79. In view of the afore stated discussions and taking into account the factual matrix of the case and
further taking into account that the goods in question is Raw Cashews nuts with Shells which are
eatable items, therefore perishable, in order to make the interim arrangement, this Court is inclined
to accept the case of the Roy Cashew and SR Cashew, by rejecting the case of the Agri Tech
supported by Real Blue. At the same time, the action on the part of the Emem having entered into
two separate contract and having appropriated money paid by them, whether it is justifiable on the
part of the Emem to reject or deny the loyal claim of Real Blue on behalf of the Agri Tech is a moot
question to be answered by the Arbitrator and in that context, this Court wanted to make an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/111693457/ 22Mr.Vijay Mohan vs M/S. Real Blue International Pvt. Ltd on 15 December, 2018
observation that from the clutches of law no privity of contract apply as there is no Arbitration Claus
between Emem and Agri Tech and if at all, any Arbitration proceedings is initiated at the instance of
either Agri Tech or Real Blue, whether the issue to rope in Emem and to take a decision at the
conduct of execution of Emem in respect of these contractors can also be decided as one of the
Arbitral issue.
80. In the result, these applications are disposed of, with the following orders:
http://www.judis.nic.in
(i) That the Roy Cashew and SR Cashew are entitled to take delivery of the cargo in
question from the Carriers i.e., R3 and R4 which reached the Tuticorin Port i.e., R5.
(ii) The Agri Tech and Real Blue would be at liberty to agitate the issue before the
appropriate Arbitral Tribunal in terms of the contract between the Agri Tech and
Real Blue where, the Emem can also be roped in.
(iii) In view of the Class 1 and 2 of the above direction, the interim order granted by
this Court on 31.01.2019 extended from time to time is hereby vacated.
Resultantly, Appl.No.917 and 918 of 2019 are dismissed and all other applications are allowed.
