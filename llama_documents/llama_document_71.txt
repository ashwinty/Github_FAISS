17.05.2023
Present: Mr. Atul Dewan along with Mr. Lalit Kumar, Counsel for the
Applicant.
RA-06/2023
1.
The Applicant has preferred a review application under section 50 of the Consumer Protection Act,
2019 seeking the review/modification of the order 02.02.2023 and in specific, the direction to
dispose off the matter as settled, as mentioned in the said order. It has been submitted by the
counsel appearing for the Applicant that as per the order dated 02.02.2023, the settlement letter
dated 28.01.2020 presented by the Opposite Party was in respect of the other litigation proceeding
being conducted before D.R.T, Lucknow. It is further submitted that the Opposite Party no.1&2 have
taken an undue advantage of non-appearance of the Applicant by misrepresenting that the matter
has been settled whereas in actual circumstances, the matter has yet not been settled completely.
2. The bare perusal of the application filed by Applicant reflects that it has been preferred under
section 50 of the New Act i.e. the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. However, the entire proceedings
of the present case took place according to the Old Act. Hence, before delving into the merits of the
present application, it is imperative to ascertain whether the present application filed on 04.03.2023
for review of the order dated 02.02.2023 is maintainable under the New Act or not.
3. The repeal of a law shall not affect the previous operation of any enactment i.e. the proceedings
under Consumer Protection Act, 1986 shall continue for cases which had been filed prior to the
implementation of Consumer Protection Act, 2019 on 20.07.2020. The same can be gauged through
the DISMISSED PAGE 1 OF 7 SMT.DARSHANA DEVI VS. TATA CAPITAL HOUSING FINANCE
LTD AND ANR.
repeal and saving section (Section 107) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 which has been
reproduced below:
"107. (1) The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is hereby repealed.
(2) Notwithstanding such repeal, anything done or any action taken or purported to
have been done or taken under the Act hereby repealed shall, in so far as it is not
inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, be deemed to have been done or taken
under the corresponding provisions of this Act.

(3) The mention of particular matters in sub-section (2) shall not be held to prejudice
or affect the general application of section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 with
regard to the effect of repeal."
4. We may also take the assistance of Section 6 (b) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 to further this
view. Section 6 (b) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 has been reproduced below:
"6 Effect of repeal. : Where this Act, or any 1 [Central Act] or Regulation made after
the commencement of this Act, repeals any enactment hitherto made or hereafter to
be made, then, unless a different intention appears, the repeal shall not
(a) revive anything not in force or existing at the time at which the repeal takes effect;
or
(b) affect the previous operation of any enactment so repealed or anything duly done
or suffered thereunder"
5. Moreover, unless the legislature explicitly provides that the amendment is retrospective in nature,
it will be considered prospective. The aforesaid view DISMISSED PAGE 2 OF 7 SMT.DARSHANA
DEVI VS. TATA CAPITAL HOUSING FINANCE LTD AND ANR.
has been taken by the Apex Court in the case of CIT v. Vatika Township (P) Ltd. reported in (2015) 1
SCC 1 wherein the Court discussed the proviso to Section 113 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and held
that it was prospective and not retrospective. While deciding the case, the Constitution Bench laid
down certain general principles which have been reproduced as under:
"28. Of the various rules guiding how a legislation has to be interpreted, one
established rule is that unless a contrary intention appears, a legislation is presumed
not to be intended to have a retrospective operation. The idea behind the rule is that a
current law should govern current activities. Law passed today cannot apply to the
events of the past. If we do something today, we do it keeping in view the law of today
and in force and not tomorrow's backward adjustment of it. Our belief in the nature
of the law is founded on the bedrock that every human being is entitled to arrange his
affairs by relying on the existing law and should not find that his plans have been
retrospectively upset. This principle of law is known as lex prospicit non respicit: law
looks forward not backward. As was observed in Phillips v. Eyre [Phillips v. Eyre,
(1870) LR 6 QB 1] , a retrospective legislation is contrary to the general principle that
legislation by which the conduct of mankind is to be regulated when introduced for
the first time to deal with future acts ought not to change the character of past
transactions carried on upon the faith of the then existing law.
29. The obvious basis of the principle against retrospectivity is the principle of
"fairness", which must be the basis of every legal rule as was observed in
L'OfficeCherifien des Phosphates v.

DISMISSED PAGE 3 OF 7 SMT.DARSHANA DEVI VS. TATA CAPITAL HOUSING
FINANCE LTD AND ANR.
Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co. Ltd. [L'OfficeCherifien des Phosphates v.
Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co. Ltd., (1994) 1 AC 486 : (1994) 2 WLR 39 :
(1994) 1 All ER 20 (HL)] Thus, legislations which modified accrued rights or which
impose obligations or impose new duties or attach a new disability have to be treated
as prospective unless the legislative intent is clearly to give the enactment a
retrospective effect; unless the legislation is for purpose of supplying an obvious
omission in a former legislation or to explain a former legislation. We need not note
the cornucopia of case law available on the subject because aforesaid legal position
clearly emerges from the various decisions and this legal position was conceded by
the counsel for the parties. In any case, we shall refer to few judgments containing
this dicta, a little later."
(emphasis in original)
6. Similarly, the Apex Court in Hitendra Vishnu Thakur vs State of Maharashtra
reported in 1994 (4) SCC 602, the court has culled out the ambit and scope of an
amending Act and its retrospective operation and has held the following:
"26. The Designated Court has held that the amendment would operate
retrospectively and would apply to the pending cases in which investigation was not
complete on the date on which the Amendment Act came into force and the challan
had not till then been filed in the court. From the law settled by this Court in various
cases the illustrative though not exhaustive principles which emerge with regard to
the ambit and scope of an DISMISSED PAGE 4 OF 7 SMT.DARSHANA DEVI VS.
TATA CAPITAL HOUSING FINANCE LTD AND ANR.
Amending Act and its retrospective operation may be culled out as follows:
(i) A statute which affects substantive rights is presumed to be prospective in
operation unless made retrospective, either expressly or by necessary intendment,
whereas a statute which merely affects procedure, unless such a construction is
textually impossible, is presumed to be retrospective in its application, should not be
given an extended meaning and should be strictly confined to its clearly defined
limits.
(ii) Law relating to forum and limitation is procedural in nature, whereas law relating
to right of action and right of appeal even though remedial is substantive in nature.
(iii) Every litigant has a vested right in substantive law but no such right exists in
procedural law.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126487326/ 3Darshana Devi vs Tata Capital Housing Finance Ltd. ... on 17 May, 2023
(iv) A procedural statute should not generally speaking be applied retrospectively
where the result would be to create new disabilities or obligations or to impose new
duties in respect of transactions already accomplished.
(v) A statute which not only changes the procedure but also creates new rights and
liabilities shall be construed to be prospective in operation, unless otherwise
provided, either expressly or by necessary implication."
7. Taking into account the aforesaid discussion, we conclude that the Consumer
Protection Act, 2019 is prospective in nature. Thus, the cases pending or adjudicated
and rights/obligations created before the coming into effect of the Consumer
Protection Act, 2019 will continue to be adjudicated under the Old Act i.e. Consumer
Protection Act, 1986. Hence, the Applicant cannot resort to the provisions as
inculcated in the New Act so far as the present case is concerned as her case will be
governed by the provisions of the Old Act.
8. So far as the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 are concerned, it does not provide
the power of review to the State Commissions. This DISMISSED PAGE 5 OF 7 SMT.DARSHANA

position of law was settled in the case of Rajeev Hitendra Pathak and Ors. v. Achyut Kashinath
Karekar and Anr. reported in (2011) 9 SCC 541 wherein the Apex Court held:
"36. On careful analysis of the provisions of the Act, it is abundantly clear that the
Tribunals are creatures of the Statute and derive their power from the express
provisions of the Statute. The District Forums and the State Commissions have not
been given any power to set aside ex parte orders and power of review and the powers
which have not been expressly given by the Statute cannot be exercised.
37. The legislature chose to give the National Commission power to review its ex
parte orders. Before amendment, against dismissal of any case by the Commission,
the consumer had to rush to this Court. The amendment in Section 22 and
introduction of Section 22-A were done for the convenience of the consumers. We
have carefully ascertained the legislative intention and interpreted the law
accordingly.
38. In our considered opinion, the decision in Jyotsana's case laid down the correct
law and the view taken in the later decision of this Court in New India Assurance Co.
Ltd. is untenable and cannot be sustained.
39. In view of the legal position, in Civil Appeal No.4307 of 2007, the findings of the National
Commission are set aside as far as it has held that the State Commission can review its own orders.
After the amendment in Section 22 and introduction of Section 22A in the Act in the year 2002 by
which the power of DISMISSED PAGE 6 OF 7 SMT.DARSHANA DEVI VS. TATA CAPITAL

review or recall has vested with the National Commission only. However, we agree with the findings
of the National Commission holding that the Complaint No.473 of 1999 be restored to its original
number for hearing in accordance with law."
9. Having discussed the position of law in terms of the power of review with the State Commission,
we hold that the proceedings in Consumer Case no. 837 of 2017 will be governed by the Consumer
Protection Act, 1986 and the order dated 02.02.2023 cannot be reviewed by this Commission.
Consequently, RA-6/2023 is dismissed as not maintainable.
10. File be consigned to the record room.
