"fheériefore, the question of the State Government "issuing a second Notification either under
Section ,§/ 11(1) or under Section 16(1) or under Section 32(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure
does not arise. To hold that a notification by the State Government under Section 11(1) or 16(1) or
32(1) of the Code is necessary, to enable the Forums to exercise Magisterial powers, would
tantamount to they». imposition of an artificial restriction that a Consum.er<'»,':'x_"».. Forum has
to be constituted by 2 notifications,.--,,"one._T'"R" under section 9 of the Consumer
Protection_*Acti~..and"'*i.. another under section 32 of the of Procedure. This could never have

to look forward to a ' ,i3iotifica.tiVon:'from_ the State Government for exercising .t_hose
"pow.e_rs,',;"when the statute has clothed these Fo~rums.withj'..--such powers by operation of law.
.30. T"ne' purport of Section 27(2) of the Consumer 5?rot'ection Act, is to create a legal fiction. This
is aijnade clear by the use of the expression "shall be deemed to be a judicial Magistrate of First
Class for the purpose of the Code of Criminal Procedure". No Court of a Judicial Magistrate is
sought to be established afresh, by section 27(2). As seen from the earlier discussion, a notification
under Section 11(1) of the Code may be necessary for establishing a new'... in Court of Judicial
