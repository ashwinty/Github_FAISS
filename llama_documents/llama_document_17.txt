ORDER
(Per: Mr. D.K. Tyagi, Member):
The complainant has filed this consumer complaint before this Commission under Section 12 read
with Section 18 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, against the opposite parties for compensation
of Rs. 25,45,000/- towards financial loss, Rs. 50,000/- as litigation expenses and Rs. 15.00 lacs
towards mental pain and agony.
2. The complainant has stated in the consumer complaint that he had a DMat account having
client ID No. 10611068 with Alankit Assignment Ltd., New Delhi. In the month of February, 2006,
the complainant on the representation of the opposite party No. 2 had opened his DMAT account
with the opposite parties and was allotted account Login ID-RAJRAV-67 and clinet ID 10683809.
The complainant was made to sign a form and the opposite parties had obtained about 40
signatures on the said form but at that time neither the said form was filled up nor any copy of the
said form was provided to the complainant despite his request. That as agreed between the
complainant and the opposite parties were supposed to provide statement of account to the
complainant every month besides doing transaction in the said account on duly issued instructions
of the complainant. The complainant was also handed over certain papers after opening of account
which contained his confidential password and also 10 delivery instruction slips accompanied by a
client master list approved by NSDL. The complainant has till date not scratched the said password
and the said paper is intact with the complainant. In absence of the said password no transaction
could have been carried out from the said account of the complainant. In the said account the
complainant got transferred his shares of 20 companies from his previous account at Alankit
Assignment Ltd. to the said account and also got transferred shares of two companies from his
father's account No. 10632052, which was also maintained by Alankit Assignments Ltd. to his said
account. After opening the said account with the opposite parties the complainant asked for the
statement of account to ascertain that his shares from his previous account maintained by Alankit
Assignment Ltd. have been duly transferred, but it was not provided. Non- providing of the
statement of account to the complainant is deficiency in service provided to the complainant. The
opposite party No. 2 had made the complainant understand that unlike other similar companies the
opposite parties' brokerage fees is only 0.35% per transaction carried out by them on instruction of
the complainant and not 1.5%. The complainant was also made to understand that no charges as the
opening of account will be charged from the complainant, but the opposite party will charge the
complainant by receiving commission of 0.35% per share transaction. That the complainant had
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10837006/ 1Dr. Raj Kumar Gaurav vs India Infoline Securites P.Ltd. on 15 April, 2015
been repeatedly requesting for providing him statement of account since in absence of the same the
complainant was unable to issue instruction for any transaction. The complainant from the very
beginning of his account with the opposite parties has not carried out any transaction in his shares
nor has till date given any instruction to do so. Sometime in May, 2006, through newspaper and
T.V. programme "Peharedaar", the complainant came to know that the opposite parties are into
business of befooling others for their personal gains and, hence, checked up with the dividends
received from various companies whose shares, the complainant had got transferred from Alankit
Assignment Ltd. to the said account of the complainant maintained by the oppsotie parties and
found out that his account holding after being transferred to the said account maintained by the
opposite parties has been drastically reduced and various transactions have been carried out from
his said account, whereas he neither issued any instruction to do so nor has carried out any
transaction himself. The complainant lodged complaint with the Branch Incharge of opposite
parties at the office of opposite party No. 2, Sh. Sandeep Patiyal and also Branch Incharge Sh.
Mukesh Jha, who were looking after the said DP account of the complainant. They admitted their
negligence and deficiency in service provided to the complainant and assured to compensate him.
The complainant believed them and waited for sometime, needful was not done by the opposite
parties. The complainant hence again contacted Sh. Sandeep Patiyal and Sh. Mukesh Jha at office of
opposite party No. 2, but they completely changed their stand and started threatening the
complainant that the opposite parties are run by underworld people and as such the complainant
should keep silent and not pursue the matter. The complainant soon spoke telephonically to the
opposite party No. 1 but to no avail. The complainant through letters also called upon the opposite
parties to provide him the statement of account as well as the contract notes, but even after
receiving the said letters the complainant was not handed over the required papers. The
complainant hence went to the local police station to lodge a complaint in the police station for the
fraudulent acts of the opposite party but on account of influence of the opposite party the same was
not registered and it took about 8 months for making the local police receive the complaint of the
complainant. The opposite party has not only committed fraud with the complainant but has also
not provided the proper service to the complainant, which they were supposed to do. The opposite
parties were to provide the service of share transactions through the DMAT account, i.e. the said
account of the complainant, but even after receiving the requisite amount from the complainant
have failed to provide the services to the complainant and to the contrary have acted without
consent or authority of the complainant and caused him loss of more than Rs. 25.00 lacs on account
of the deficiency in service provided to the complainant. In case the opposite parties had supplied
the statement of the said account to the complainant from time to time, then the complainant would
have been able to find out about the embezzlement from his said account. The opposite parties, on
account of the criminal complaint made by the complainant, had to seek intervention of the Hon'ble
High Court for getting the arresting stayed and in the petition, have filed copy of document
purporting to be the Power of Attorney whereas the complainant never executed the same. On the
other hand the complainant had been regularly seeking intervention of the NSDL and was supplied
with another document purported to be Power of Attorney and also shown to be attested in Bombay
on 18.11.2008, whereas the complainant was in Roorkee at that time. The said document purported
to be Power of Attorney is neither stamped nor duly authenticated, neither any witness to the
execution was present, as is evident from the copy of the said document filed before the Hon'ble
High Court of Uttarakhand. The entire act of preparing the said document purporting to be Power
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10837006/ 2Dr. Raj Kumar Gaurav vs India Infoline Securites P.Ltd. on 15 April, 2015
of Attorney is fraudulent and also a deficiency in service provided to the complainant by playing
with the faith of the complainant reposed in the opposite parties by opening his said account. It is
also relevant to point out here that the Power of Attorney bears date 26.12.2005 and admittedly the
said account of the complainant has been opened on 15.02.2006 by the opposite party. During
investigation, the opposite party again carried out transaction in the said account of the
complainant, as is evident from the statement of account dated 04.09.2008, which was provided to
the complainant by NSDL through its letter dated 24.11.2008 after obtaining the same from the
opposite party. The statement of account dated 04.09.2008 shows a transaction of about Rs.
45,000/-, whereas the complainant had never consented for the same. The statement of account
provided to the complainant vide letter dated 24.11.2008 shows the transaction of shares pertaining
to more than 45 companies, whereas the complainant had got transferred shares from 22 companies
from his and his father's DMAT account maintained by Alankit Assignment Ltd. and after transfer of
his shares from Alankit Assignment Ltd., the complainant has not carried any transaction nor
instructed to do so from his said account as such statement of account showing more than 45
companies indicates that during investigation also the opposite parties are carrying out transaction
from the said account of the complainant. Hence, the opposite parties continue to commit
deficiency in service provided to the complainant. On account of the deficiency in service by the
opposite parties, the complainant has been made to suffer financial loss on account of the shares of
22 companies, which are disclosed in this consumer complaint. The shares mentioned in the 22
companies, at the time of transfer from Alankit Assignment Ltd. to the said account maintained by
the opposite party, bore value of more than Rs. 12.00 lacs and at the time, when the embezzlement
was carried out by the opposite parties, the share market was at its peak and the shares bore a value
of more than double, i.e. about 25.00 lacs. On account of the acts of the opposite parties, the
complainant not only sustained loss on account of unauthorized transactions carried out by the
opposite parties in the said account, but also on account of the litigation amounting to Rs. 50,000/-
arisen out of the deficiency in service provided by the opposite parties. The complainant is a
practicing doctor and on account of the acts/omisions of the opposite parties, has not been able to
concentrate on his profession since he is running from pillar to post to seek the available remedies
against the opposite parties for the fraudulent acts of the opposite parties, thereby sustaining more
financial loss. The cause of action for the complaint has arisen to the complainant initially on
15.02.2006, then in May, 2006, then on the dates mentioned hereinabove and then on 04.09.2008
and continues eversince then. The complainant is a consumer of the opposite parties within the
meaning of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and this Commission has the jurisdiction to hear and
decide the consumer complaint.
3. The opposite parties have filed the written statement and pleaded that this Commission has no
jurisdiction to hear and decide the case. Trading was being done by the complainant to earn profits,
therefore, the dispute is not ad-judicable in the summary procedure provided under the Consumer
Protection Act and the appropriate remedy is to refer the dispute to Arbitrator or to the Civil Court,
where detailed evidence can be produced. It is admitted that the complainant opened his account in
the opposite party-company in the month of February, 2006. Before opening the account, the
complainant had perused the opening form as well as terms and conditions, thereafter, he put his
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10837006/ 3Dr. Raj Kumar Gaurav vs India Infoline Securites P.Ltd. on 15 April, 2015
signatures. One copy of the opening form was also provided to the complainant. There was a clear
instructions in the written agreement made between the parties that the complainant may receive
any information through internet for which the complainant had provided his e-mail id
rajkumargaurav12@rediffmail.com. After opening the account, the complainant himself transferred
shares of 22 companies and also purchased shares of Rs. 6.00 lacs in the said account, but the
complainant had not paid any money to the opposite party company. The opposite party company
had provided password to the customer to know about the account and transaction through
internet. The complainant used to take informations from the company and all informations
regarding the account of the complainant were available on the internet. The opposite parties also
sent informations regarding the account and all transactions through courier. Therefore, there is no
deficiency in service on the part of the opposite parties. The opposite parties have charged brokerage
as per Broker-Client Agreement in the light of Rules of Stock Exchange. Clause No. 5 of the
Broker-Client Agreement is as follows:-
"Brokerage and Taxes: IISPL shall be entitled to a brokerage of upto the maximum rate permitted
by SEBI/Exchange, of the value of every transaction that may be undertaken by the CLIENT by
using the E-broking and/or Offline Service. The rates of brokerage for each Product that the
CLIENT may avail of under this Agreement are mentioned in trading and product guidelines
brochure hereto. The rates of brokerage may be revised by IISPL from time to time at its sole
discretion.
The CLIENT shall also pay any applicable taxes, including service taxes, handling charges,
depository charges that may be levied on any transactions undertaken pursuant to this Agreement."
It is denied that the complainant neither issued any instruction for various transactions nor has
carried out any transaction himself. Any transaction of sale or purchase was done by the company
was on the instruction of the complainant for which information was given to the complainant on
his e-mail id. Apart from this, if the complainant desires he could have obtained the statements of
account after depsoting a nominal charges in the opposite parties company. The opposite party
company is not responsible for any loss to the complainant due to share market crash. The opposite
party company is a reputed company in the country, who was awarded best Broker Award by
"Finance India Pacific Magzine". The complainant had filed a false report in the police and after
investigation, the police had filed FR in the court. The complainant had never suffered a loss of Rs.
25.00 lacs. The Hon'ble High Court had also passed an order in favour of the opposite party
company and stayed the arrest of its employees. Due to the debit balance outstanding against the
complainant, the opposite party company had asked for money for which the complainant had
issued a cheque No. 445540 of Rs. 49,000/- on 29.04.2006 of Union Bank of India, which was
dishonoured by the bank. The opposite party company had informed the complainant vide its letter
dated 23.10.2006, even then the complainant did not give any money to the opposite party
company. Thereafter, the opposite party had sold the shares for a sum of Rs. 45,000/- to get money
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10837006/ 4Dr. Raj Kumar Gaurav vs India Infoline Securites P.Ltd. on 15 April, 2015
from the complainant's account on 04.09.2008. The complainant is a clever man, who had
transferred his and his father's shares of 22 companies worth Rs. 6,32,388/- and in lieu of the value
of shares, the complainant had purchased shares of 23 other companies worth Rs. 6.00 lacs through
the oppsotie party company without paying any amount. There was neither value of Rs. 12.00 lacs
at the time of transfer of the shares nor value of those shares became 25.00 lacs when the share
market was at its peak. All the transactions were made by the opposite party company on the
instruction of the complainant, therefore, there is no deficiency in service on the part of the opposite
party company. The complainant is not a consumer in view of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
There is a clause in the agreement that all the disputes between the customer and the company shall
be referred to the Arbitration. Valuation of this case is only Rs. 6,32,388/-, therefore, this
Commission has no jurisdiction to hear and decide the case. In the additional pleas, the opposite
party company has stated that the complainant had filled a Broker-Client Agreement form on
26.12.2005 and a Power of Attorney was also provided to the opposite party company, which was
signed by the complainant and two other witnesses. In the Power of Attorney the complainant had
authorized the company that in case of debit balance, the company can recover the money after
selling the shares of the complainant. The opposite party company is registered with BSE and NSE
and works under the Rules and Regulations of SEBI. When the opposite party company ask for its
money to the complainant, the complainant had threatened the employees of the company and also
lodged a criminal case against the employees of the opposite party company. Police after
investigation has filed FR in the court. The complainant had also sent a false complaint to the NSDL
for which NSDL had replied to the complainant. No employee of the opposite party company had
threatened the complainant. The opposite party company is not responsible for any loss caused to
the complainant, due to the crash of the market. There is no amount outstainding towards the
company. There is no cause of action arose against the opposite party company. The complainant is
not entitled for any amount rather per contra the opposite party company is entitled to get Rs.
6,087.48 ps. on the basis of statement till 04.03.2010.
4. The complainant-Dr. Rajkumar Gaurav has filed an affidavit (Paper Nos. 157-165) in evidence.

6. The complainant has also filed a rejoinder affidavit (Paper Nos. 234 to 236) and written
arguments (Paper Nos. 245 to 249), whereas the opposite parties have filed their written arguments
(Paper Nos. 250 to 265).
7. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and have also gone through the record,
affidavits of parties as well as written arguments and the case laws filed by them.
8. Learned counsel for the opposite parties submitted that the complainant is guilty of serious
suppression of real and true facts to this Commission. The consumer complaint is not maintainbale
under law or on facts and the same is liable to be dismissed in limine. The complainant has no locus
standi to file the present consumer complaint, as he is not a consumer under Section 2(d) of the
Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The opposite party company M/s India Infoline Ltd., is a trading
company of National Stock Exchange of India ltd. having it's registeration with Securities and
Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Rules 1992. The company is also a trading member of the Bombay
Stock Exchange Ltd. Learned counsel has also argued that the trading was being done by the
complainant to earn profits. The profits, whatsoever, were accrued in the transactions were being
paid to the complainant after deducting the brokerage. In the background of these complicated
facts, the dispute is not ad-judicable in the summary procedure provided under the Consumer
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10837006/ 6Dr. Raj Kumar Gaurav vs India Infoline Securites P.Ltd. on 15 April, 2015
Protection Act and the appropriate remedy is to refer the dispute to Arbitrator or to the Civil Court,
where detailed evidence can be produced. As per the complaint, the complainant himself alleged in
his consumer complaint that the cause of action arose on February, 2006 and there is no
correspondence between the complainant and the opposite party since February, 2006 till April,
2007. The complainant has filed the said complaint in the year 2009. Hence, the complaint filed by
the complainant is time barred. This Commission has no jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate
upon the dispute involved in the consumer complaint, as it is not a consumer dispute and does not
lie within the ambit of the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The complainant had
opened a Trading Account with the opposite parties to earn profits and not for the self employment.
Thus, the complainant cannot be said to be a "consumer" under the Consumer Protection Act, as the
trading and sale/purchase of shares is totally a commercial activity. The complainant is a Physician
and doing his profession as Doctor. It has not been mentioned anywhere in the agreement that the
transaction of shares is the only source of livelihood for the complainant and he is not indulge in any
other occupation/profession elsewhere. It means that the complainant has doing the commercial
activity for making profit and he is well aware of the market condition and having well experience of
trading of 5 years also as he himself and his father is having various demat accounts in other
companies also and same is operating by the complainant. The Forum under the Act does not
contemplate the determination complicated issues of fact involving taking of elaborate oral evidence
and adducing of voluminous documentary evidence and a detailed scrutiny and assessment of such
evidence since this is not a matter which can be satisfactorily adjudicated upon in the time bound
proceedings under the Rules of Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Learned counsel also argued that
this consumer complaint is liable to be dismissed under Section 26 of the Consumer Protection Act,
1986, as the same is prima facie false, frivolous, malicious, vexatious and engineered taking
advantage of the fact that no court fee is payable for the institution of case under the Consumer
Protection Act, 1986. The complainant also knows that if any dispute arises in transaction, the
dispute may be settled by referring to the Sole Arbitrator, as per the Arbitration and Conciliation
Act, 1996 as amended from time to time. But no notice has been given to the opposite party in this
effect and neither approached nor referred to Arbitrator with respect to the said dispute. The
complainant is a well educated man, who understands the terms and conditions, as signed and
executed the documents on his own will. Per contra, the learned counsel for the complainant argued
that the consumer complaint filed by the complainant is maintainable before the Consumer Fora
and since the opposite parties have misused the funds of the complainant and have purchased and
sold the shares of the complainant without his knowledge and consent, and hence, the complainant
is entitled to the relief claimed and his consumer complaint is fit to be allowed.
9. Having considered the respective submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the parties,
we think that the first and foremost issue to be decided in this case is whether the complainant falls
under the definition of "consumer" as provided under Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection
Act, 1986 or not and whether the consumer complaint filed by the complainant is maintainable
before the Consumer Fora or not. Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 reads as
under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10837006/ 7Dr. Raj Kumar Gaurav vs India Infoline Securites P.Ltd. on 15 April, 2015
"(d) "consumer" means any person who-
(i) buys any goods for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and
partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment and includes any user of such goods
other than the person who buys such goods for consideration paid or promised or partly paid or
partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment, when such use is made with the approval
of such person, but does not include a person who obtains such goods for resale or for any
commercial purpose; or
(ii) hires or avails of any services for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly
paid and partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment and includes any beneficiary of
such services other than the person who hires or avails of the services for consideration paid or
promised, or partly paid and partly promised, or under any system of deferred payment, when such
services are availed of with the approval of the first mentioned person but does not include a person
who avails of such services for any commercial purposes;
10. From the above quoted definition of "consumer", it is abundantly clear that the person who
avails the services for any commercial purpose or the person who is engaged in any commercial
activity, does not fall under the definition of "consumer" and cannot be said to be "consumer" as per
the provisions of Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The "commercial purpose" means generating
profit and engaged in the activity not for the purpose of earning the livelihood.
11. In the present case, the complainant is engaged himself in share trading business not for the
purpose of earning his livelihood. He is engaged in share trading activities and is investing his
savings in shares. Investment means generating profit from the amount so invested. The
complainant has nowhere averred in his consumer complaint that he has invested his money in
shares not for earning profit. The same is also not the source of livelihood for the complainant. The
complainant has been investing his money for past few years in shares, goes to show that the
complainant has been investing his money in shares for earning profit, hence it can safely be said
that the complainant is engaged in commercial activity and, hence, the complainant does not fall
under the definition of the "consumer" as provided under the provisions of Consumer Protection
Act, 1986 and, as such the consumer complaint was not maintainable before the Consumer Fora.
The averments made by the complainant in the consumer complaint also depict that he has been
trading in the business of shares and the complainant has raised the dispute with regard to sale and
purchase of shares by the opposite parties.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/10837006/ 8Dr. Raj Kumar Gaurav vs India Infoline Securites P.Ltd. on 15 April, 2015
12. This apart, the dispute raised by the complainant in the present case pertains to purchase and
sale of shares and in the consumer complaint, the complainant has nowhere pleaded that he is
dealing with shares business as self-employment for earning livelihood. It is a settled law that the
transactions regarding sale and purchase of shares are commercial transactions and the person
engaged in the said transactions cannot be termed as "consumer" as per the definition of the word
provided under Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
13. The complainant also cannot be said to be unaware of the risk involved in the share market, as
he himself for the past few years, has been dealing in shares, which further proves the fact that the
complainant is indulged in share trading business for the purpose of earning profit and, as stated
above, the same is not the source of earning his livelihood by the complainant and hence he is not
covered under the definition of "consumer" as provided under Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer
Protection Act, 1986.
14. In the case of National Seeds Corp. Ltd. vs. P.V. Krishan Reddy; I (2009) CPJ 99 (NC), the
Hon'ble National Commission has observed that there is no bar for adjudication of complaint by
Fora, even there is existence of arbitration clause in agreement. Therefore, we are convinced that
even there is arbitration clause in agreement between the appellants and the respondent even then
Fora has right to hear and decide the matter.
15. Learned counsel for the opposite parties have cited a decision of Hon'ble National Commission
in the case of Anand Prakash vs. A.M. Johri; (2000) 3 CPJ 291. In the said case, it is held that the
transaction in question is purely a commercial transaction and the appellant, in the given facts, is
not a consumer within the meaning of Section 2(1)(d) of the Act and the dispute being raised is not a
consumer dispute within the meaning of Section 2(1)(e) of the Act. Learned counsel also cited a
decision of Hon'ble National Commission in Revision Petition No. 2441 of 2012; India Info Line
Commodities Ltd. & Anr. Vs. Jagu Srinivasa Rao decided on 12.02.2014, wherein the Hon'ble
National Commission has held that the petitioner is not a consumer and the Consumer Fora is not
armed with the power to decide commercial transactions.
16. The Hon'ble National Commission in the case of V.K. Agarwal (Dr.) vs. Infosys Technologies
Ltd. and others; I (2013) CPJ 373 (NC), has held that the sale and purchase of shares are
commercial transactions and, therefore, the complainant is not a "consumer". In the case of Pahlaj
Manamal Nichani vs. Mis Process and Cutomer Complaints and another; II (2013) CPJ 105, the
Karnataka State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Bangalore has held that the person who

cannot be considered as "consumer dispute". In the present case also, the complainant has made
purchase of large number of shares and the said sum cannot be said to be a small sum and it can
safely be said that the complainant has made purchase of shares in bulk. The share transactions by
the complainant in this present case is for commercial purpose. In the case of Vijay Kumar vs.
Indusind Bank; II (2012) CPJ 181 (NC) the complainant was engaged in share trading business. It
was held by the Hon'ble National Commission that regular trading in purchase and sale of shares is
a commercial transaction and only motive of the same is to earn profit. The Hon'ble National
Commission in the case of Som Nath Jain vs. R.C. Goenka and another; I (1994) CPJ 27 (NC), has
held that it was alleged that the opposite party had undertaken to purchase shares to the tune of Rs.
7.00 lacs and to submit accounts showing the purchase etc., but the opposite party did not submit
genuine documents regarding purchase of shares etc. It was held that the complaint is not
maintainable.
17. Further, the Hon'ble National Commission in its decision dated 16.04.2014 rendered in
Revision Petition No. 3367 of 2013; Sudhangsu Bhusan Dutta vs. The Joint Managing Director,
Mansukh Securities & Finance Ltd. and others, has held that since the petitioner is an investor in
shares and hence he does not fall under the definition of "consumer". In the said decision, the
Hon'ble National Commission has placed reliance on its earlier decision dated 21.08.2012 given in
First Appeal No. 362 of 2011; Ganapathi Parmeshwar Kashi and another vs. Bank of India and
another. The said case pertained to DMAT Account and the appeal was dismissed by the Hon'ble
National Commission. Aggrieved by the said order, a Special Leave to Appeal (Civil) No. 5401 of
2013; Ganapathi Parmeshwar Kashi and another vs. Bank of India and another, was filed, wherein
the Hon'ble Apex Court has held as under:-
"(ii) The concurrent finding recorded by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission,
Maharashtra and the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission that the petitioners
cannot be treated as consumer within the meaning of Section 2(d) of the Consumer Protection Act,
1986, is based on analysis of the pleadings filed by the parties. The DMAT account was opened by
the petitioners purely for commercial transactions. Therefore, they were rightly not treated as
consumer so as to entitle them to claim compensation by filing complaint under the 1986 Act."
18. In a recent decision again, the Hon'ble National Commission in the case of R.R. Equity
Brokers Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Dinesh Kumar Jaiswal; III (2014) CPJ 396 (NC), has held that the
respondent is trading regularly in share business which is commercial activity and under these
circumstances, he would not fall under the definition of "consumer" as per the Act. Moreover,
regular trading in the sale and purchase of shares is a purely commercial activity and the only
motive is to earn profits. Therefore, this activity being purely commercial one, is not covered under
the provisions of the Act. In the instant case also, the complainant has nowhere pleaded that he is
doing the share trading business for self-employment nor it has been pleaded that the services
provided by the opposite parties were being availed by the complainant exclusively for the purpose

of earning his livelihood by means of self-employment. It is well settled that the dispute between
the parties relating to commercial purposes are excluded under the Act.
19. Further, the Hon'ble National Commission in the case of Steel City Securities Ltd. vs. G.P.
Ramesh and another; I (2014) CPJ 576 (NC), has held that the sale purchase of shares is a
commercial purpose and trading in shares is purely commercial activity and only motive is to earn
profit and the complainant is not a "consumer".
20. In view of the aove factual position and the law cited above, it can safely be held that the
complainant in the present case does not fall under the definition of "consumer" as provided under
Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, as he has invested money in shares for
earning profit, i.e., for commercial purpose and hence the consumer complaint filed by him is not
maintainable before the Consumer Fora and is liable to be dismissed as such.
21. There is no dispute with regard to the fact that the criminal proceedings are pending between
the parties and the matter has gone upto the Hon'ble High Court of Uttarakhand at Nainital. An
F.I.R. was lodged by the complainant against the opposite parties and the police has submitted F.R.
after investigation.
22. However, since the complainant does not fall under the definition of "consumer" as provided
under Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and hence the present consumer
complaint filed by him is not maintainable before the Consumer Fora and is liable to be dismissed.
23. For the reasons aforesaid, the consumer complaint is dismissed. No order as to costs.
