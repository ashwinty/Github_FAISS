Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13785167/ 1Lucina Land Development Ltd vs Union Of India & Ors on 27 April, 2022
alleged, in the complaint filed by them before the learned NCDRC,
that they were ―consumers(cid:129) of the petitioners within the meaning of
Section 2(1)(d)(ii)5 of the 1986 Act, as the units had been booked by

By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14 ―4. That, this complaint is preferred on
behalf of the Complainants and for the benefit of all the allottees, who are consumers and are having
the same interest as a Class Actions Petition. The Complainants submit that the facts of the case of
each of the Complainants and all the allottees are same and the issues involved, disputes &
controversies are common in nature having a common interest and have suffered identical
deficiency of service and unfair trade practice, the terms and conditions of allotment are almost
same and rely on identical evidences and therefore, come under the definition of Complainant as per
section 2(1)(b)(iv) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The Complainants, therefore, seek leave of
this Hon'ble Commission to file a common complaint under section 12(i)(c) of the Consumer
Protection Act, 1986 (as amended till date). A separate application in this regard is also being filed
on behalf of the Complainants for grant of permission by this Hon'ble Commission to file one
complaint for the benefit of all consumers so interested.
*****
11. That it has come to the knowledge of the complainants that at the time when the initial booking
amount was received by the Opposite Parties in the month of August / September 2009 from some
of the complainants, the Opposite Parties were not in possession of all the approvals for going ahead
with the construction of the Project proposed to be constructed by them, then how could they have
accepted money for selling the flats from the complainants i.e., unfair trade practices on the part of
the Opposite Parties under Section 2(1)(r) of the Consumer Protection Act. 1986.
12. It is thus an admitted position that the Opposite Parties were involved in unfair trade practice
and deceiving tactics against the general consumers and particularly the present group of
complainants as well as other allottees as the said project was launched and payments towards
booking of the particular flats were being received by the opposite Parties much before they
obtained necessary approvals from the competent authorities, for construction of the said project
including the various amenities promised and assured to the flat purchasers, on the basis of which
the Complainants and all other were attracted to purchase the flats In the said project. Accordingly,
the intention and motive of the Opposite Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH
NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14 Parties was always to deceive the allottees of the said
project, particularly the complainants herein writ large on the face of record since inception. At the
time all the government clearances from various departments for the project were not in place.
Accordingly the Opposite Parties had engaged in unfair trade practice with the complainants and all
other allottees and are guilty of violations of the provisions of Section 3(2) of MOFA, 19636.
13. The Complainants are attaching herewith a Statement showing the details of each Complainant
Tower/Building Number, Flat No., Area of the flat, total cost of the flat and the total consideration
amount paid upto-date by each and every complainant to the Opposite Parties. Hereto annexed and
marked as ANNEXURE "C-4" is the said Statement.
14. The Complainants are also attaching herewith the copy of the Ledgers account issued by the
Opposite Parties showing the details of the payments made by the Complainants. In general the
Complainants have paid upto 95% of the cost of the flats booked by them and allotted by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13785167/ 3Lucina Land Development Ltd vs Union Of India & Ors on 27 April, 2022
Opposite Parties. Hereto annexed and marked as ANNEXURE "C-5" (colly.) is a copy each of the
Ledgers accounts issued by the Opposite Parties showing the details of the payments made by the
Complainants to the Opposite "Parties.
15. The Complainants came to know about the Project since the year 2009 or later, through various
means, including banners displayed by the Opposite Parties through giant hoardings,
advertisements in News Papers and the Brochures distributed by the Opposite Party no.1 inviting
the public at large for booking of the fiats. The Sales Staff made aggressive sales pitches &
representations on behalf of M/s. Lucina Land Development Limited for the project called
INDIABULLS GREENS PANVEL showing beautiful Master Plans & layouts of fiats and amenities
like a school, hospital, dub house, shopping mall, on the basis of which they eventually took the
important decision to make a choice to buy their preferred flat. The Opposite Parties coaxed & lured
the Complainants to pay advance booking amount, offered construction linked payment schedules,
delivery in 2 to 3 Maharashtra Ownership of Flats Act, 1963 Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed
By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14 years and to book fiats in the project,
based on those promises. The reputation of the builder and property appreciation from the
proposed interational airport were touted as additional incentives for the Complainants to book the
flats. There are also cases where the Complainants had paid more than 90% as per allotment
letters/Agreements for sale, including 18% interest/penalty in the case of delay in payment of
instalments. The Complainants submit that at the time of booking of the flats Opposite Party no.1
had promised to give possession within 2/3 years of booking. As on date of filing the complaint in
2017, the Complainants have no clarity about the possession date and on enquiring Opposite Party
no.1 has consistently been giving a further date. On following up for possession on the new date, yet
again again a new delivery date is given. Presently the Opposite Parties are talking about giving
possession in June, 2017, subject to various clearances, in other words there is total uncertainty
even now.
16. The following is a summary of the grievances of the complainants:
a) Booking the Flat & Agreement related problems • False representation on status of approval of
the project from Government & Statutory bodies • Presenting a Master plan with 15 storied building,
gardens, school, hospital, club house & shopping mall, which was unilaterally changed next year, to
37 floors with a revised layout • The super built/ salable area of the flats was increased by upto 25%
depending on building and size of flat. There was no corresponding increase in the carpet area.
Protesting buyers were told by sales executives that this is due to change of layout, additional
facilities amenities being provided.
• Buyers were re-alloted flats in the new master plan and In many cases forced to re-book on higher
floors, with floor rise/ PLC charges payable. When the complainants objected, they either didn't
respond or offered refund with 15% cancellation charges on total Signature Not Verified Digitally
Signed By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14 cost of the flat. Many were also
told that they could sell their flats later, on super build area, so why protest.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13785167/ 4Lucina Land Development Ltd vs Union Of India & Ors on 27 April, 2022
• Later the Opposite Parties asked buyers to sign one-sided Agreements, did not allow any changes
to highly objectionable clauses and threatened that we take it as it is or cancel with 15% cancellation
charges of total cost of the flat. This Agreement also had a revised delivery possession date of 5 years
9 months.
• The Opposite Parties have subsumed car parking charges within the per unit rate of the flats,
which is illegal. There are also specific promises made by the Sales persons & Customer Service
Executives while selling the flat, but disowned later, when complainants went to sign the Agreement
b) Payment & Financing related problems
1. The Opposite Parties were quick to levy interest charges & penalties on the slightest delay in
payment, despite not communicating payment demands on time.
2. In the specific case of Mr. Sangram Choudhury (Complainant # 36), he was allotted Flat N-2204
in December 2010. He received a letter dated 13.12.201 that the construction has started and
demanded payment of 1st instalment. Having booked under ADF, a tripartite agreement was signed
with Indiabulls finance with the flat number N2204. Subsequently, they unilaterally changed the
entire master plan & layout with no communication to the buyers. They gave him limited options to
choose a new flat and threatened to forfeit his advance, if he cancelled the booking. He was
penalised with interest despite the delay being on account of the Opposite Parties.
3. Prior to every demand for payment, they were providing Architect certificates to prove status of
construction, originally from Mr. Hafeez Contractor (an architect reputed for professionalism and
accuracy). With constant delays at their own end, they shifted to issuing certificates from an internal
architect Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022
15:58:14 and started raising demands. When the Complainants protested, they ignored and coerced
to accept the new arrangement.
4. All liabilities of the interest on loans, loss of IT rebate on loans and financing charges (particularly
related to their sister company) are to the Complainants account despite delays in communicating,
construction schedules not being met and pending approvals for possession being from Opposite
Parties end.
c) Delay in Delivery of Completed flats
i) For flats booked over the last 7 years, for many
complainants there is no clarity from the Opposite Parties as to when the possession of the flats will
be given. The Opposite Parties' customer service executives keep on giving new dates for every query
on delivery date. This has become an endless & meaningless exercise. Their regular plea, when they
do respond, is of clearances not being availably and construction delays. The complainants have no
control over this matter and have to face the consequences of shabby, unreliable and arrogant
service from the OP's executives.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13785167/ 5Lucina Land Development Ltd vs Union Of India & Ors on 27 April, 2022
ii) The OP had promised various facilities & amenities through advertisements, hoardings,
brochures and direct selling. They promised world class construction and quality of life. The current
project is a highly diluted version of these advertisements, with little or no resemblance to earlier
promises made. Site visits made by many complainants reveal severe compromises on all facilities &
amenities, congested layout, poor quality of construction and fittings. The complainants are of the
unanimous view that, if they knew of these deficiencies and unlivable layout, they would not have
booked flats in Indiabulls Greens. Panvel and would have exercised alternative options. However,
the Opposite Parties are preventing the Complainants from cancelling the booking by means of
unfair trade practices of demanding heavy cancellation charges equal to 15% of the total cost of the
flat.
Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14
iii) The experience with OP's executives and their failure to deliver on their various promises is
causing severe mental trauma, anxiety and harassment as some complainants were depending on
completion and peaceful possession of flats in this project, for occupation post retirement or
other-wise. The opportunity cost of the delay, unkept promises and fight for the rights of the
complainants is Incalculable.
17. Some of the Complainants took permission to visit their flat and were shocked to see the quality
of the work which are much inferior to what had been promised. Most of the amenities are missing.
No club house, no school. No Hospital, No Mall. Nothing of what they had told at the time of
booking. So the innocent people are cheated by the Opposite Party No.1. The hard earned money
spent for booking of the flat is blocked with Opposite Party No.1 and the Complainants are trapped
as they are not allowed to exit from the project by way of demanding 15% of the total cost of the flat
as cancellation charges.
18. The Complainants state that in view of enormous delay in completion of the project and
uncertainty in the date for handing over possession of the fiats some' of the complainants
approached the Opposite Party no.1 for cancellation of their booking. However, the Opposite Parties
demanded cancellation charges equal to 15% of the total cost of the flats, which is a significant
disincentive to exercise this option & thereby preventing the Complainants from exiting from the
said project. It is therefore, evident that the Opposite Parties have deceived the Complainants by not
honouring their commitments and not carrying out the construction as promised by them. The
Opposite Parties have collected crores of rupees from innocent consumers, by selling only dreams of
owning a flat. It is a clear case of deficiency in service and unfair trade practices adopted by the
Opposite Parties.
19. The Complainants have also got the Building and the flats inspected by Mr.Hitendra Mehta,
Architect and Govt. Approved valuer who after obtaining permission from the Opposite Parties
visited the building and inspected the construction along with the approved plans and had
submitted his detailed report with his Affidavit. It has been observed in Signature Not Verified
Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14 his report apart from
inferior quality of construction there are deficiency in carpet area of the flats as compared to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13785167/ 6Lucina Land Development Ltd vs Union Of India & Ors on 27 April, 2022
area sold by the OPs to the Complainants. He has also given the present prevailing market value for
calculation of compensation for shortfall in carpet area of the flat and for not providing various
amenities promised but not provided at all at the site. Hereto annexed and marked as(cid:129)
3. These alleged indiscretions of the petitioners, according to para 20 of the complaint, amounted to
deficiency in service and unfair trade practices within the meaning of Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the
MOFA and were actionable under the 1986 Act. Para 20 of the complaint, therefore, exhorted the
learned NCDRC to exercise the powers vested in it by the 1986 Act and to direct the petitioners to
complete the construction and hand over the possession of their respective flats with the requisite
occupancy and building completion certificates along with all amenities, or, in the alternative, to pay
compensation to the respondents equal to the market value of the flats in the area in question along
with interest and costs.
4. Para 22 of the complaint sought to justify the filing of the complaint as a class action, thus:
―22. That the Opposite Parties Builders have also not carried out the construction of
the Buildings as promised in the Brochure and or the Allotment Letters. The cause of
action triggered due to enormous delay in handing over the physical possession of the
allotted flats to the complainants with complete development as per the agreed terms
and conditions of the allotment in a habitable condition with all promised/assured
amenities already mentioned which is seriously lacking till date. The immediate
cause of action for institution of the instant complaint by the complainants as a class
action petition as they are having common interest and Signature Not Verified

grievances against the Opposite Parties. The Complainants are also involved together
as a class having common interest, aggrieved against the Opposite Parties under
various heads as stated above. Therefore, the cause of action is continuing and the
complaint as filed is not barred by limitation(cid:129)
5. Para 27 of the complaint, therefore, prayed thus:

would be just and proper and further in the interest of justice that this Hon'ble

of the Opposite Parties by promising to give possession of the flats within 2 years and
collecting huge amounts before obtaining , requisite approvals for construction of the
promised flats. The Complainants as a class is also aggrieved with the enormous
delay in construction of the project and to deliver possession of the allotted flats in a
habitable condition by the Opposite Parties. Besides the Complainants as a class have
also suffered huge monetary loss in the form of income tax benefit, due to staying in
rented houses, paying EMI to the Bank on loan, etc.(cid:129) It was also pointed out, in the
application, that the claim of the respondents themselves aggregated to over (cid:132) 1
crore, as a result of which the jurisdiction, to entertain the complaint, vested in the
learned NCDRC. In view thereof, the application prayed for grant of permission to
the respondents under Section 12(1)(c) of the 1986 Act to file a common complaint on
behalf of all flat purchasers/buyers/complainants having similar grievances and, for
the said purpose, to issue public notice by way of advertisement in the newspapers.
8. The petitioners filed a reply to the aforesaid application of the respondents under Section 12(1)(c)
of the 1986 Act. Apart from traversing the allegations levelled by the respondents in the complaint
on merits, it was alleged that several of the complainants, who were residing elsewhere in the

country as well as abroad, had failed to disclose as to how the premises booked by them were not
intended to be put to commercial use, in which case they were not ―consumers(cid:129) within the meaning
of Section 2(1)(d) of the 1986 Act. It was submitted that the construction of the flats was complete
and that the petitioners were willing to hand over possession subject to issuance of Signature Not
Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14 occupation
certificate. It was further submitted, in paras 25 and 26 of the reply, thus:
―25. It is most respectfully submitted that a complaint under Section 12(l)(c) of the
Consumer Protection Act read with Order I Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure can
be filed where there are numerous consumers having the "same interest" i.e. a
common grievance against the same person and the complaint is filed on behalf of or
for the benefit of all such numerous consumers, and seeking same relief for all of
them. It is submitted that the all the buyers of the flat cannot be treated at par with
each other as such most of the Complainants are investors whereas some of them
may be genuine consumers. Thus in absence of the element of "same interest" the
present Complaint in the representative capacity deserves to be dismissed. The
Complainants thus ought to approach a civil court to address its grievance. On this
ground alone the present application under 12(l)(c) deserves to be dismissed.
26. Admittedly, the Complainants herein have sought to file the present Complaint
for and on behalf of all customers of the Answering Opposite Party/Respondent who
have made a booking for a flat in Indiabulls Greens, Village Kon, Panvel.
As admitted by the Complainants in the Complaint the facts and circumstances pertaining to each
booking differs from case to case as different customers have purchased different flats from the
Answering Opposite Party/Respondent at different points of time ranging over the past decade, at
different rates and have made pro rata payments to different extents with or without defaults
therein. It is, therefore, submitted that by no stretch of imagination it can be said that the numerous
customers of the Answering Opposite Party/Respondent stand on a similar footing with respect to
each other. It is therefore submitted that the present Complaint is not maintainable as the cause of
action has not arisen till date. It is further submitted that the Complainants have approached this
Hon'ble Commission with malafide intentions of making unlawful gains and therefore no
permission shall be given to file the present Complaint on this short ground alone and the present
application ought to be dismissed.(cid:129) Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI

9. By order dated 16th May, 2018, the learned NCDRC proceeded to allow the respondents'
application under Section 12(1)(c) of the 1986 Act and, consequently, to direct publication of public
notice regarding the complaint in the media, under Order I Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure,
1908 (CPC). The reasoning of the learned NCDRC is contained in the following passages from the
impugned order:
―5. I have heard the submissions made on behalf of the opposite parties. Section
12(1)(c) of the Act is reproduced as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13785167/ 10Lucina Land Development Ltd vs Union Of India & Ors on 27 April, 2022
―12. Manner in which complaint shall be made. -
(1) A complaint in relation to any goods sold or delivered or agreed to be sold or
delivered or any service provided or agreed to be provided may be filed with a District
Forum by -
(c) one or more consumers, where there are numerous consumers having the same
interest, with the permission of the District Forum, on behalf of, or for the benefit of,
all consumers so interested"
6. On bare perusal of the above, it is clear that one or more consumers with the
permission of Consumer Fora can pursue the complaint on their behalf as also on
behalf of other numerous consumers having the same interest but not arrayed as
complainants provided the complaint is filed for the benefit of the complainants as
also for the benefit of consumers having same interest in the outcome of the
complaint but not arrayed as complainants.
7. In order to find out whether or not the instant complaint fits into the requirements of Section
12(1)(c) of the Act, I have carefully perused the complaint, in particular, the prayer clause. On
reading of the complaint as also the prayer Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL
SINGH NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14 clause, it is clear that instant complaint has been
filed in respect of a booking of development project involving numerous consumers and the
complainants have filed the instant complaint against the opposite parties as a class action on their
behalf and also on behalf of and for the benefit of all other consumers similarly placed and having
same interest in the outcome of the complaint. Merely because, some of the complainants are NRls,
will not make them persons of a different class. If the claims of some of the existing complainants
have already been satisfied, they will not get any relief subject to the evidence. Thus, in my view,
requirements of Section 12(1)(c) of the Act are fulfilled in this case and accordingly, I allow the
application under section 12(1)(c) of the Act and permit the complainants to proceed with the
complaint as a class action.(cid:129) (Emphasis supplied)
10. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order dated 16 th May, 2018, the petitioners have approached this
Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India by means of the present petition.
11. The respondent, during the course of these proceedings, challenged the maintainability of the
present petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, citing, for the purpose, the judgment
of the Supreme Court in Cicily Kallarackal v. Vehicle Factory8 especially emphasising para 9 of the
said decision, which reads thus:
―9. While declining to interfere in the present Special Leave Petition preferred
against the order passed by the High Court in exercise of its extraordinary
jurisdiction Under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, we hereby make it clear
that the order of the Commission are incapable of being questioned under the writ
jurisdiction of the High Court, as a statutory appeal in terms of Section 27A(1)(c) lies
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13785167/ 11Lucina Land Development Ltd vs Union Of India & Ors on 27 April, 2022
to this Court.
Therefore, we have no hesitation in issuing a direction of caution that it will not be proper exercise
of jurisdiction by the High Courts to entertain writ petitions against such orders of (2012) 8 SCC 524
Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14
the Commission.(cid:129)
12. As against this, learned Counsel for the petitioners, relying on the following passages from the
report in State of Karnataka v. Vishwabharathi House Building Coop. Society9, sought to contend
that the petition was maintainable:
―51. It may be true that there does not exist any provision for transfer of case from
one forum to the other or there does not exist any provision to grant injunction.
Absence of such provisions in our opinion would not render the statute ultra vires the
Constitution or unworkable.
52. The very fact that in a given case a party under the said Act may approach upto
this Court and/or may otherwise take recourse to the remedy of judicial review, the
interests of the parties must be held to have been sufficiently safeguarded.
53. The provisions relating to power to approach appellate court by a party aggrieved
by a decision of the forums/State Commissions as also the power of High Court and
this Court under Article 226/227 of the Constitution of India and Article 32 of this
Court apart from Section 23 of the Act provide for adequate safeguards. Furthermore,
primarily the jurisdiction of the forum/ commissions is to grant damages. In the
event, a complainant feels that he will have a better and effective remedy in a civil
court as he may have to seek for an order of injunction, he indisputably may file a suit
in an appropriate civil court or may take recourse to some other remedies as provided
for in other statutes.(cid:129) (Emphasis supplied)
13. Substantive arguments were advanced by the learned Counsel for both parties on the
maintainability of the present petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India as well as on
the merits of the impugned order dated 16th May, 2018 passed by the learned NCDRC.

Submissions and analysis Re. Maintainability
14. Mr. Piyush Singh, learned Counsel for the allottees, submitted that the present petition was not
maintainable under Article 227 of Constitution of India, in view of the availability of an alternate
remedy by way of an appeal to the Supreme Court under Section 2310 of the 1986 Act, which
provides for a right of appeal against every order passed by the learned NCDRC under Section
21(a)(i) of the 1986 Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13785167/ 12Lucina Land Development Ltd vs Union Of India & Ors on 27 April, 2022
15. This position, contends Mr. Piyush Singh, also stands underscored in para 9 of the judgment in
Cicily Kallarackal8 reproduced supra.
16. Ms. Agnihotri, learned Counsel for the petitioners, contends, per contra, that Cicily Kallaracka8
was rendered in the context of the right conferred by Article 226 of the Constitution of India,
whereas the present petition has been filed under Article 227. Para 53 of the report in
Vishwabharathi House Building Coop. Society9, she submits, clearly indicates that the right to file a
petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is independently available, apart from the
right conferred by Section 23 of the 1986 Act. This position, she submits, stands expressly
recognised in the opening sentence of para 53 of the (2003) 2 SCC 412
23. Appeal. - Any person, aggrieved by an order made by the National Commission in exercise of its
powers conferred by sub-clause (i) of clause (a) of section 21, may prefer an appeal against such
order of the Supreme Court within a period of thirty days from the date of the order:
Provided that the Supreme Court may entertain an appeal after the expiry of the said period of thirty
days if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period. Signature Not

Vishwabharathi House Building Coop. Society9, which reads thus:
―53. The provisions relating to power to approach appellate court by a party
aggrieved by a decision of the forums/State Commissions as also the power of High
Court and this Court under Article 226/227 of the Constitution of India and Article
32 of this Court apart from Section 23 of the Act provide for adequate safeguards.(cid:129)
As such, submits Ms. Agnihotri, the right available under Section 23 of the 1986 Act
cannot derogate from the right to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under Article
227 of the Constitution of India.
17. Having heard learned Counsel and perused the aforesaid decision, it is clear that Cicily
Kallarackal8 addressed the issue of availability of the right to file a writ petition under Article 226 of
the Constitution of India and was not rendered under the context of Article 227 of the Constitution
of India. No doubt, the right to approach the writ court under Articles 226 and 227 of the
Constitution of India are, in a way of speaking, interlinked and cognate. That said, however, there is
a subtle difference between the two provisions inasmuch as the jurisdiction exercised by a court
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is in the nature of judicial review by issuance of, inter
alia, the high prerogative writs of habeas corpus, certiorari, mandamus, prohibition and quo
warranto, envisaged by the said Article, whereas the jurisdiction exercised under Article 227 of the
Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14
Constitution of India is supervisory in nature.
18. There is a fundamental jurisprudential difference between judicial review jurisdiction and
supervisory jurisdiction. The nature of the power exercised by a court in each case is also essentially
different. The exercise of powers under Article 227, in a sense, more constricted than the exercise of
powers under Article 226, inasmuch as the scope of examination of the merits of the decision under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13785167/ 13Lucina Land Development Ltd vs Union Of India & Ors on 27 April, 2022
challenge is, under Article 226, more expansive than under Article 227. While exercising jurisdiction
under Article 227, what the court is essentially concerned with is ensuring that the courts and
tribunals subject to its supervisory jurisdiction exercise their powers appropriately.
19. The Article 227 court does not sit in appeal over the decisions of the court or tribunal below. It is
not expected to scrutinize the merits of the said decision with a view to correct the said decision on
merits. If, however, the decision is one which involves erroneous exercise of jurisdiction or
assumption of power where no power exists, then the court, under Article 227, would be justified in
interfering. Equally, if the decision demonstrates discharge, of the Court or Tribunal below, of its
functions otherwise than the manner in which the law requires the Court of Tribunal to so
discharge, the decision can be corrected in exercise of the supervisory jurisdiction vested in the High
Court. Else, the position in law is trite, as enunciated in Estralla Rubber v Dass Estate11, Garment
Craft v. Prakash Chand Goel12 and Puri Investment v. Young India13 that a writ court, under Article
227, (2001) 8 SCC 97 2022 SCC OnLine SC 29 2022 SCC OnLine SC 283 Signature Not Verified
Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14 is not even empowered
to correct errors in the orders passed by the courts below. The distinction is as explicit as it is
nuanced.
20. Vishwabharathi House Building Coop. Society9 refers to ―Articles 226/227 of the Constitution
of India(cid:129). The opening sentence in para 53 of the report in the said case holds that adequate
safeguards, against orders passed by the learned NCDRC, are available to an aggrieved party by way
of writ to a High Court under Article 226/227 or to the Supreme Court of India under Article 32 of
the India or by way of an appeal under Section 23 of the 1986 Act. It does not, however, provide any
further guidance as to the circumstances in which these remedies would, individually, be available
against the decision of the learned NCDRC. Even so, the view canvassed by Mr Piyush Singh, if
accepted, would amount to holding that, where the appellate remedy under Section 23 of the 1986
Act is available, the remedy under Article 227 of the Constitution of India stands irrevocably
foreclosed, which would militate against the tenor of the view expressed in Vishwabharathi House
Building Coop. Society9.
21. The issue, however, stands largely answered, in principle, by the judgment of the Supreme Court
in Virudhunagar Hindu Nadargal Dharma Paribalana Sabai v. Tuticorin Educational Society14
(―Virudhunagar(cid:129), hereinafter), though the said decision did not examine the issue in the backdrop
of the 1986 Act. In that case, the Supreme Court was concerned with the aspect of availability of a
remedy to the High Court, seeking exercise of its supervisory (2019) 9 SCC 538 Signature Not
Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14 jurisdiction
over the courts below, where a remedy of appeal against the decision of courts below was available
under the CPC. Paras 11 to 13 of the report read thus:
―11. Secondly, the High Court ought to have seen that when a remedy of appeal under
section 104 (1)(i) read with Order XLIII, Rule 1 (r) of the Code of Civil Procedure,
1908, was directly available, the respondents 1 and 2 ought to have taken recourse to
the same. It is true that the availability of a remedy of appeal may not always be a bar
for the exercise of supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court. In A. Venkatasubbiah
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13785167/ 14Lucina Land Development Ltd vs Union Of India & Ors on 27 April, 2022
Naidu v. S. Chellappan & Ors15, this Court held that "though no hurdle can be put
against the exercise of the Constitutional powers of the High Court, it is a well
recognized principle which gained judicial recognition that the High Court should
direct the party to avail himself of such remedies before he resorts to a Constitutional
remedy".
12. But courts should always bear in mind a distinction between (i) cases where such
alternative remedy is available before Civil Courts in terms of the provisions of Code
of Civil procedure and (ii) cases where such alternative remedy is available under
special enactments and/or statutory rules and the fora provided therein happen to be
quasi judicial authorities and tribunals. In respect of cases falling under the first
category, which may involve suits and other proceedings before civil courts, the
availability of an appellate remedy in terms of the provisions of CPC, may have to be
construed as a near total bar. Otherwise, there is a danger that someone may
challenge in a revision under Article 227, even a decree passed in a suit, on the same
grounds on which the respondents 1 and 2 invoked the jurisdiction of the High court.
This is why, a 3 member Bench of this court, while overruling the decision in Surya
Dev Rai vs. Ram Chander Rai16, pointed out in Radhey Shyam Vs. Chhabi Nath17
that ―orders of civil court stand on different footing from the orders of authorities or
Tribunals or courts other than judicial/civil courts(cid:129).
(2000) 7 SCC 695 (2003) 6 SCC 675 (2015) 5 SCC 423 Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed
By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14
13. Therefore wherever the proceedings are under the code of Civil Procedure and the forum is the
Civil Court, the availability of a remedy under the CPC, will deter the High Court, not merely as a
measure of self imposed restriction, but as a matter of discipline and prudence, from exercising its
power of superintendence under the Constitution. Hence, the High Court ought not to have
entertained the revision under Article 227 especially in a case where a specific remedy of appeal is
provided under the Code of Civil Procedure itself."
(Emphasis supplied)
22. The afore-extracted passages from Virudhunagar14 distinguish between the situation where the
order under challenge is passed by a civil court and a remedy of appeal lies to another civil court,
vis-à-vis a situation in which the order under challenge is not passed by a civil court, but by a
quasi-judicial authority or tribunal, or where the remedy of appeal does not lie to a civil court. In the
former case, i.e. where it is a CPC-to-CPC appeal, the Supreme Court held that the remedy of appeal
would operate as a ―near total bar(cid:129) to the availability of supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227
of the Constitution of India. Where, however, the order under challenge is not passed by a civil
court, no appeal against the said order is available under the CPC, or the appeal that is available is
not to another civil court, the remedy under Article 227 does not appear to be foreclosed.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13785167/ 15Lucina Land Development Ltd vs Union Of India & Ors on 27 April, 2022
23. In this context, the extracted words from the earlier decision of the Supreme Court in A.
Venkatasubbiah Naidu15 are of some significance. In the said decision, the Supreme Court has held
that, while there cannot be any hurdle to the exercise of constitutional powers of the High Courts,
where other alternate remedies are available, the High Court should direct the party to avail such
Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14
remedies ―before he resorts to a constitutional remedy(cid:129). A. Venkatasubbiah Naidu15, therefore,
expressed the view that, before seeking recourse to the constitutional remedy of writ before the High
Court, other alternative remedies available to the litigant ought to be directed to be exhausted.
24. This option is, obviously, not available where the other alternate remedy is to the Supreme
Court, as in the case of Section 23 of the 1986 Act. The principle in A. Venkatasubbiah Naidu15,
which has been followed in Virudhunagar14 has no application, therefore, in a case where the
remedy of appeal is to the Supreme Court, as under Section 23 of the 1986 Act, as there can be no
question of the party availing such remedy before resorting to a writ remedy available under the
Constitution to the High Court. A party cannot be directed to exhaust the alternate remedy available
before the Supreme Court before approaching the High Courts under Article 226. There can be no
appeal from Caesar to Mark Antony.
25. Relegating the party to the remedy of appeal under Section 23 of the 1986 Act would, therefore,
operate to foreclose, once and for all, the right to seek recourse to writ jurisdiction of the High Court
under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution of India. This, in my considered opinion, can never be
the intent of the Supreme Court in Virudhunaga14 and would also militate against the opening
sentence in para 53 of the Vishwabharathi House Building Coop. Society9.
26. For all these reasons, I am of the opinion that the right of the petitioners, to approach this Court
under Article 227 of the Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing
Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14 Constitution of India cannot be affected by the remedy of appeal to the
Supreme Court available under Section 23 of the Consumer Protection Act.
27. Having said that, it is also clear that any party which seeks to invoke the jurisdiction of the High
Court under Article 227 subjects itself to the rigours of the provision and to the restrictions inbuilt in
it. The High Court, under Article 227, cannot examine the matter with the same latitude as would be
available to a Court which exercises appellate jurisdiction.
28. The contention of Mr Piyush Singh that Article 227 of the Constitution of India ought not to be
invoked by the petitioner as a remedy of appeal, against the impugned order of the learned NCDRC,
lay to the Supreme Court under Section 23 of the 1986 Act, is fallacious on another count as well,
which somewhat pre-empts the discussion that is to follow hereinafter. Section 23 provides for an
appeal against a decision of the NCDRC in exercise of the powers conferred on it by Section 21(a)(i).
Section 21 deals with the jurisdiction of the learned NCDRC. Sub-section (a)(i) of Section 21 vests
jurisdiction in the learned NCDRC to entertain complaints where the value of the goods or services
and compensation, if any, exceeds (cid:132) 1 crore. The respondents have valued their complaint in excess
of (cid:132) 1 crore on the premise that the complaint is maintainable as a class action proceeding on behalf
of all the allottees of units in the project. As I proceed to hold hereinafter, however, the pleadings in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13785167/ 16Lucina Land Development Ltd vs Union Of India & Ors on 27 April, 2022
the Complaint do not make out a case for justified institution of the Complaint as a class action
proceeding for all the allottees in the Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH
NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14 project, or even for the 51 complainants before the learned
NCDRC. Unless the number of consumers having "sameness of interest" is manifest from the
pleadings in the Complaint, in the manner envisaged by law and as stipulated by the Supreme Court
in Brigade Enterprises Ltd. v. Anil Kumar Virmani18, it is not possible to hold that the cumulative
value of the goods or services, or the compensation claimed, by all such consumers having sameness
of interest, would exceed (cid:132) 1 crore. The very maintainability of the Complaint before the learned
NCDRC, under Section 21(a)(i) is, therefore, questionable. If Section 21(a)(i) is not applicable,
neither is Section 23.
29. Where the justifiability of the invocation, by the respondents, of the jurisdiction of the learned
NCDRC under Section 21(a)(i) is itself in doubt, it is obviously not open to the respondents to cite
the availability of an alternate remedy to the petitioners under Section 23 as a ground to non-suit
them under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. A plea of alternate appellate remedy, predicated
on erroneous invocation of original jurisdiction of the Court or Tribunal below, obviously has to fail.
30. Even on facts, therefore, the assertions in the Complaint filed by the respondents do not make
out a case of availability, to the petitioners, of an alternate remedy
31. The objection to maintainability, as advanced by Mr. Piyush Singh, is, therefore, rejected.

35. Paras 7 to 25 of the report in Brigade Enterprises18 read thus:
―7. Before we get into an analysis of the rival contentions with specific reference to
the statutory provisions, it is necessary to look into the reliefs prayed for, by the

Complainants; and/or
iv. Pass any other and/or further relief, which this Hon'ble Commission thinks fit and
proper, in the facts and circumstances of the case, in favour of the complainants and
against the OP."
8. The pleadings on the basis of which the respondents sought the aforesaid prayers,
in brief, are as follows : (i) that the appellant launched the subject project in the year
2013; (ii) that the project styled as ―Brigade Lakefront(cid:129) was to comprise of about
1100 units in three blocks, namely, Amber block, Blue block and Crimson block; (iii)
that Amber block, also called Building No. 1, was to have seven wings, namely, Wings
A, B, C, D, E, F and G; Blue block, also called Building No. 2 was to have Wings H, I,
J, K, L, M and N and Crimson block, also called Building Nos. 3 and 4 were to have
Wings O, P, Q, R, S and T; (iv) that in respect of the flats in Blue block, the promised
delivery date was 30.06.2016 with a six months grace period; (v) that though the
completion certificate and structural stability certificate were also issued by the
Consultant/Architect for the buildings in Blue block on 3.05.2017, the occupancy
certificate was issued partially on 28.12.2018 and the occupancy certificate for the
balance was issued on 25.06.2019; (vi) that in respect of the buildings in Crimson
block, the promised delivery date was 31.01.2018 with a grace period of six months;
(vii) that though the completion certificate for the Crimson block was issued by the
architect on 10.08.2018, the occupancy certificate was issued partially on 28.12.2018;
(viii) that the builder was guilty of unfair trade practice, inasmuch as the terms and
conditions of the agreement prescribed a paltry compensation of Rs. 5 per square feet
to the purchasers, if there was delay in completion of the project, while penal interest
was levied on the buyers at 18% p.a. whenever they committed default or delay in
making payment; (ix) that on account of the delay on the part of the appellant in
handing over possession, the buyers suffered losses in the form of payment of
monthly rent, interest on the loans taken and payment of higher registration charges,
as the circle rates had Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH
NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14 gone up in the meantime; and (x) that
therefore they were constrained to file a complaint.
9. From the aforesaid averments contained in the consumer complaint, it could be
seen that the delay on the part of the builder in handing over possession, was the
primary ground on which compensation was sought by the respondents. We have
already extracted the prayers made in the original complaint. Interestingly the prayer
portion of the complaint does not contain the quantification of the total amount of
compensation sought by the respondents either individually or collectively for and on
behalf of all the purchasers of all the 1134 residential apartments. The prayer portion
of the complaint refers to paragraph 46 of the complaint, for the purpose of
computation of delay compensation. But paragraph 46 of the complaint does not
convey any meaning except if taken into account along with paragraph 45. Therefore,
paragraphs 45 and 46 of the complaint are extracted as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13785167/ 19Lucina Land Development Ltd vs Union Of India & Ors on 27 April, 2022
"45. Computation of "Total Period of Delay"--The Complainants assert that the Total
Period of Delay be calculated as follows : Delay Period Start - Promised Date of
Possession, not considering the grace period; and Delay Period End - Either of the
following two dates based on facts of individual complainants:
a. Where possession was taken prior to issuance of Occupancy Certificate, the Date of
Occupancy Certificate; OR b. Where possession was taken after the issuance of
Occupancy Certificate, then Date of possession Offered;
It would be relevant to state that the meaning and nature of „possession(cid:134) as stated by
the complainants in this para would mean legal possession only where said
possession had been given or offered to be given upon confirmation of readiness of
the flat for possession, in adherence to Schedule of Construction Agreement.
46. It is clearly and unambiguously inferred that the Buyers shall receive possession
by executing the Sale Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH
NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14 Deed and getting the same registered. Both
actual possession and sale deed registration have to be done in unison in accordance
with clauses of the agreement for construction. Hence, possession without registering
and executing sale deed or vice versa does not together construe to be "possession"
for the purpose of calculating the delay suffered by the buyers. If both events are
done on separate times, the later date of the two would prevail. It is respectfully
submitted that for the given residential project, the date of grant of Occupancy
Certificate shall be reckoned as the pivotal event to ascertain delayed possession and
calculating compensation based thereon."
10. Paragraphs 45 and 46 contain a tacit admission that the period of delay in
handing over possession of the flats, may vary from buyer to buyer in respect of the
purchasers of all the 1134 apartments. This is why the respondents have sought the
indulgence of the Commission to compute the delay in respect of each case, on the
basis of formulae indicated in paragraph 45.
11. However, paragraph 41 of the consumer complaint contains the valuation of the
complaint, at least insofar as the 91 complainants who jointly filed the consumer
complaint are concerned. The relevant portion of paragraph 41 of the complaint
reads as follows:
"It is submitted that as per the Agreement terms reproduced above, OPs are
committed to pay meager delay compensation of Rs. 5/- per sq. ft. of saleable area,
per month, which comes to around 0.1% per annum of the sale consideration, or even
lesser. On the contrary, the penalty charged by the OPs in case the buyers' default or
delay in paying the instalment is 18% per annum. It is clear that the balance of
performance is over 180 times against the buyers who have been bearing the brunt of
the absolute mismanagement of project by the OPs. The buyer is not only patiently

waiting for the possession but also gets a double whammy to keep paying all the
instalments without enjoying the property. Of the total number of complainants
those who have preferred to approach this Hon'ble Forum in this instant Complaint,
the Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing
Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14 aggregate value of sale for 51 complainant-buyers alone, is
about Rs. 66 Crore whereas the aggregate amount disbursed by the OP so the same
buyers, in the name of Delay Compensation is a meager, less than Rs. 10 lakh which
is just about 0.1% for the entire of delay of more than 2 years."
12. Before we proceed further we must record one important fact, namely, that even
according to the respondents-complainants, the project comprised of three blocks
namely Amber block, Blue block and Crimson block. Amber block was to have seven
Wings with 386 apartments. It appears that none of the owners of these 386
apartments in Amber block have joined with the respondents-complainants. This is
why the entire discussion about the delay in completion of the project, with reference
to the timeline of events found in paragraph 14 of the consumer complaint, refers
only to Blue block and Crimson block. The appellant has given a tabulation in their
counter to the original complaint, pointing out that Blue block comprises of 412
apartments, out of which the owners of only 47 apartments have joined in the filing of
the complaint and that Crimson block has 336 apartments, out of which the owners
of only 4 apartments have joined in the complaint.
13. In view of the fact that none of the owners of the apartments in Amber block have
joined in the filing of the complaint, coupled with the fact that there is no pleading
with respect to the timeline of the project in respect of Amber block, the consumer
complaint filed by the respondents cannot be treated as one representing the owners
of 386 apartments in Amber block. The respondents ought to have either included as
one of the complainants, the owner of one of the apartments in Amber block or at
least made necessary averments in the pleading about the timeline for completion of
the Amber block, to make the complaint, as one filed in a representative capacity on
behalf of the owners of flats in all the three blocks. Let us now see at least whether the
complaint was maintainable in a representative capacity on behalf of the owners of
the flats in Blue block and Crimson block, in the light of the requirements of Section
35(1)(c) of the Act.
Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14
14. Section 35(1)(c) enables one or more consumers, where there are numerous consumers having
the same interest, with the permission of the District Commission, to file a complaint, on behalf of
or for the benefit of all consumers so interested. It is needless to point out that the sine qua non for
invoking Section 35(1)(c) is that all consumers on whose behalf or for whose benefit the provision is
invoked, should have the same interest. Interestingly, Section 35(1) (c) uses the disjunction ―or(cid:129) in
between two sets of words, namely, (i) ―on behalf of(cid:129); and (ii) ―for the benefit of(cid:129). Clause (c) of
Sub-Section (1) of Section 35 reads as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13785167/ 21Lucina Land Development Ltd vs Union Of India & Ors on 27 April, 2022
"one or more consumers, where there are numerous consumers having the same
interest, with the permission of the District Commission, on behalf of, or for the
benefit of, all consumers so interested."
15. Therefore, a complaint filed under Section 35(1)(c) could either be ―on behalf of(cid:129) or ―for the
benefit of(cid:129) all consumers having the same interest.
16. Section 38(11) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 makes the provisions of Order I Rule 8 of
the First Schedule to the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 applicable to cases where the complainant is a
consumer referred to in Section 2(5)(v), which defines a ‗complainant' to mean one or more
consumers, where there are numerous consumers having the same interest.
17. Order I Rule 8, CPC, unlike Section 35(1)(c) operates both ways and contains provisions for a
two-way traffic. It not only permits plaintiffs to sue in a representative capacity but also permits
people to be sued and to be defended in an action, in a representative capacity. Order I Rule 8 reads
as follows:--
"8. One person may sue or defend on behalf of all in same interest.--(1) Where there
are numerous persons having the same interest in one suit,--
(a) one or more of such persons may, with the permission of the Court, sue or be sued, or may
defend Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022
15:58:14 such suit, on behalf of, or for the benefit of, all persons so interested;
(b) the Court may direct that one or more of such persons may sue or be sued, or may defend such
suit, on behalf of, or for the benefit of, all persons so interested.
(2) The Court shall, in every case where a permission or direction is given under sub-rule (1), at the
plaintiff's expense, give notice of the institution of the suit to all persons so interested, either by
personal service, or, where, by reason of the number of persons or any other cause, such service is
not reasonably practicable, by public advertisement, as the Court in each case may direct.
(3) Any person on whose behalf, or for whose benefit, a suit is instituted, or defended, under
sub-rule (1), may apply to the Court to be made a party to such suit.
(4) No part of the claim in any such suit shall be abandoned under sub-rule (1), and no such suit
shall be withdrawn under sub-rule (3), of rule 1 of Order XXIII, and no agreement, compromise or
satisfaction shall be recorded in any such suit under rule 3 of that Order, unless the Court has given,
at the plaintiff's expense, notice to all persons so interested in the manner specified in sub-rule (2).
(5) Where any person suing or defending in any such suit does not proceed with due diligence in the
suit or defence, the Court may substitute in his place any other person having the same interest in
the suit.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13785167/ 22Lucina Land Development Ltd vs Union Of India & Ors on 27 April, 2022
(6) A decree passed in a suit under this rule shall be binding on all persons on whose behalf, or for
whose benefit, the suit is instituted, or defended, as the case may be."
18. In simple terms, the salient features of the stipulations contained in Order I Rule 8 CPC can be
summed up as follows:
Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14
(i) where there are numerous persons having the same interest in one suit, one or more of such
persons may, with the permission of the Court, sue on behalf of or for the benefit of all persons so
interested;
(ii) where there are numerous persons having the same interest in one suit, one or more of such
persons may be sued or one or more such persons may defend such suit, on behalf of or for the
benefit of all persons so interested;
(iii) the Court itself may, without the plaintiffs or defendants seeking any permission under Order I
Rule 8(1)(a), direct that one or more such persons may sue or be sued or may defend the suit on
behalf of and for the benefit of all persons interested;
(iv) notice of the institution of the suit to all persons so interested either by personal service or by
public advertisement should be ordered by the Court in both categories of cases, namely, where
permission is given by the Court on the application of the individuals or direction is issued by the
Court itself;
(v) any person on whose behalf or for whose benefit the suit is instituted or defended may seek to be
made a party to the suit;
(vi) abandonment of the whole or part of the claim, withdrawal of the suit or the recording of any
agreement, compromise or satisfaction shall not be allowed by the Court unless notice to all persons
interested in the matter is issued either by personal service or by public advertisement.
(vii) the Court may at any time substitute the person suing or defending in a representative capacity,
with any other person, if the former was not prosecuting the suit or defence with due diligence.
(viii) the decree passed in the suit covered by this Rule will be binding on all persons.
Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14
19. The Explanation under Order I Rule 8 is of significance. It distinguishes persons having the same
interest in one suit from persons having the same cause of action. To establish sameness of interest,
it is not necessary to establish sameness of the cause of action.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13785167/ 23Lucina Land Development Ltd vs Union Of India & Ors on 27 April, 2022
20. The Explanation under Order I Rule 8, is a necessary concomitant of the provisions of the Rules
1 and 3 of Order I. Order I Rule 1, CPC, allows many persons to join in one suit as plaintiffs. Order I,
Rule 3 allows many persons to be joined in one suit as defendants. But to fall under Order I Rule 1 or
Order I Rule 3, the right to relief should arise out of or be in respect of the same act or transaction
allegedly existing in such persons, jointly, severally or in the alternative. To some extent, Rules 1 and
3 of Order I are founded upon the sameness of the cause of action. This is why the Explanation
under Order I Rule 8 distinguishes sameness of interest from the sameness of the cause of action.
21. Since ―sameness of interest(cid:129) is the pre-requisite for an application under Order I Rule 8, CPC
read with Section 35(1)(c) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, it was necessary for the
respondents to include in the consumer complaint, sufficient averments that would show sameness
of interest. As we have pointed out earlier the total number of residential apartments constructed in
three blocks comprising of about 20 wings (7 wings each in Amber and Blue blocks and 6 wings in
Crimson block) were 1134. There are no pleadings insofar as the purchasers of 386 residential
apartments in the 7 wings of Amber block are concerned. Even in respect of the owners of the
remaining 748 residential apartments in blue block and Crimson block, the complaint does not
contain any specific averments regarding sameness of interest. The delay in handing over possession
of the residential apartments might have given rise to a cause of action for the individual purchasers
of flats to sue the builder. But sameness of the cause of action is not equal to sameness of interest.
The existence of sameness of interest, has been questioned by the appellant-builder on the ground
that delay compensation as stipulated in the Agreements was offered to the purchasers and that
some of them accepted the same without any demur or protest, while a few others have refused to
accept. It is not clear from the consumer complaint as to Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed
By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14 how (i) those who have accepted the
compensation under protest; (ii) those who accepted without protest; and (iii) those who refused to
accept the compensation, have the sameness of interest.
22. The period of delay in the completion of the project and the handing over of possession, does not
appear to be uniform in all 1134 cases. The respondents-complainants cannot project sameness of
interest for the purchasers in whose case the period of delay was negligible and those in whose cases
there was a huge delay.
23. We may have to look at the issue also from the point of view of the buyers. The delay in handing
over possession need not necessarily be the only deficiency in service on the part of the
appellant-builder. Some of the purchasers of flats may also have other complaints and their right to
proceed against appellant cannot be stultified by a few individuals invoking Section 35(1)(c). That a
few purchasers have chosen to approach the Karnataka State Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission to ventilate their individual grievances shows that all the 1134 buyers do not have the
same interest as that of the respondents. At least if the respondents have given the names of
purchasers of all flats on whose behalf the present complaint could be entertained, they would have
been better off. But they have not done so.
24. Reliance is placed by the learned senior counsel for the respondents, upon the Judgment of this
Court in Chairman, Tamil Nadu Housing Board, Madras v. T.N.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13785167/ 24Lucina Land Development Ltd vs Union Of India & Ors on 27 April, 2022
Ganapathy (supra), to drive home the point that the object of Order I Rule 8 is to facilitate the
decision of questions in which large number of persons are interested, without recourse to the
ordinary procedure and that, therefore, the provision must receive an interpretation which will
subserve the object of its enactment. This Court pointed out in the said case that though each of the
allottees of plots by the Housing Board may be interested individually in fighting out the demand
separately made or likely to be made by the Board, it would not make Order I Rule 8 inapplicable.
25. But the above decision in Tamil Nadu Housing Board (supra) cannot be pressed into service by
the respondents for two reasons, namely, (i) that what was Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed
By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14 questioned in a representative suit in
that case, was the additional demand sought to be made by the Housing Board on all the allottees
uniformly, for an amount over and above the tentative price originally fixed; and (ii) that in any case
this Court restricted the applicability of the decision only to those allottees of the low income group.
Therefore, the sameness of interest has to be tested on the basis of the nature of the reliefs claimed
and the pleadings that pinpoint the sameness of interest.(cid:129)
36. Thereafter, relying on its earlier decision in Rameshwar Prasad Shrivastava v. Dwarkadhis
Projects Pvt. Ltd.22, Anjum Hussain v. Intellicity Business Park Pvt. Ltd.23 and Vikrant Singh Malik
v. Supertech Ltd.24, the Supreme Court emphasised the fact that a common complaint could be filed
by complainants who had ―sameness of interest(cid:129), vis-a-vis the alleged deficiency in service of the
service provider.
37. The Supreme Court has, in this context, distinguished between ―sameness of interest(cid:129) and
―sameness of cause of action(cid:129). In the case before it, the Supreme Court noted that, though there
were a number of purchasers of residential units in the project under consideration before it, who
had grievances against the builder, their grievances were distinct and different. The judgment is also
an authority for the proposition that ―sameness of interest(cid:129) should be manifest from the pleadings
in the complaint filed before the Consumer Forum. In other words, from the pleadings in the
Complaint, the Consumer Forum should be in a position to hold that the persons whose cause the
complainants before it were seeking to espouse had identical (2019) 2 SCC 417 (2019) 6 SCC 519
Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14
grievances against the opposite party and that the deficiency in service of the opposite party vis-a-vis
the said persons were, from the pleadings, manifestly the same. Else, a consolidated consumer
complaint as a class action would not be maintainable under Section 35(1)(c) of the 2019 Act - and,
therefore, under Section 12(1)(c) of the 1986 Act.
38. Mr. Piyush Singh has sought to submit that, in examining whether the complaint was
maintainable as a class action petition, the Court was required to be guided by the prayers in the
complaint. If the prayers were identical, he submits that a class action complaint could be
maintainable. He points out that, in the present case, the prayers in the complaint filed by his clients
sought omnibus reliefs ―to complete the construction with all promised amenities and to hand over
vacant and peaceful possession of their respective flats with occupancy and building completion
certificate issued by the competent authority to the complainants as well as other
allottees/purchasers/buyers within the stipulated time as may be decided by(cid:129) the learned NCDRC,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13785167/ 25Lucina Land Development Ltd vs Union Of India & Ors on 27 April, 2022
failing which the petitioners ought to be directed to give alternate flats of similar standards and
carpet area to each of the complainants, failing which they be directed to compensate the purchasers
and to refund the amounts paid by them. Inasmuch as these prayers applied to all the allottees of
residential units in the project, Mr. Piyush Singh submits that the learned NCDRC could not be said
to have erred in permitting the complaint to be filed as a class action proceeding under Section
12(1)(c) of the (2020) 9 SCC 145 Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI
Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14 1986 Act.
39. Ms. Agnihotri, learned Counsel for the petitioners submits, per contra, that the pleadings in the
complaint itself indicate that there is no ―sameness of interest(cid:129) for all the allottees in the project. In
fact, she submits that no such sameness of interest is apparent even qua the 51 complainants before
the learned NCDRC. She submits that, in fact, in respect of flat allottees, the scheduled date for
taking of possession of the flats had itself not been reached, so that there could be no question of the
allottees being aggrieved by any delay in handing over the flats or by any deficiencies in the flats
themselves. With respect to the other allottees, as such, submits Ms. Agnihotri, even on facts, the
grievances of the allottees of the individual units in the complex of her client were distinct and
different, and no class action proceeding under Section 12(1)(c) could be permitted to have been
instituted. The learned NCDRC has, in passing the impugned order dated 16 th May, 2018, she
submits, proceeded merely on the basis of the prayer in the complaint without examining the aspect
of maintainability of the class action proceeding as filed by the respondents with the seriousness it
deserves.
40. Inasmuch as the number of allottees who have ―sameness of interest(cid:129) is not forthcoming or
apparent from the pleadings in the complaint, Ms. Agnihotri submits that it cannot be said that the
claims of the allottees having sameness of interest, when consolidated, would exceed (cid:132) 1 crore, so
that the question of the jurisdiction of the learned NCDRC to entertain the complaint would also be
highly disputable. Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing
Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14
41. Having heard learned Counsel and perused the record and in view of the law enunciated in
Brigade Enterprises18, I am of the opinion that the submission of Ms. Agnihotri deserves to be
accepted and that of Mr. Piyush Singh, correspondingly, rejected.
42. Brigade Enterprises18 is clear and categorical in requiring that, in order to maintain a class
action proceeding under Section 35(1)(c) of the 2019 Act - or, correspondingly, under Section
12(1)(c) of the 1986 Act - the pleadings in the complaint had necessarily to unequivocally indicate
―sameness of interest(cid:129) of all the persons whose cause the complainants before the Consumer Forum
were seeking to espouse, vis-à-vis the opposite party.
43. In the present case, while there is an omnibus recital, in para 4 of the complaint, that the facts
relating to the allottees of the project are the same and that common issues disputes and
controversies are involved, with the allottees having common interest and having suffered identical
deficiency of service, the pleadings that follow thereafter belie this assertion. Para 16 of the
complaint sets out, in a bulleted fashion, various alleged complaints relating to the allocation of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13785167/ 26Lucina Land Development Ltd vs Union Of India & Ors on 27 April, 2022
units to the allottees in the project. The complaint does not, however, identify these various
perceived deficiencies in service vis-a- vis the allottees aggrieved thereby, by identifying the
deficiencies in service by which the individual allottees were aggrieved. Nor is there any assertion, in
the complaint, that each and all of the grievances enumerated in para 16 of the complaint applied to
every allottee of Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing
Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14 units in the complex, whose cause the complainant chose to espouse.
Even in respect of the 51 complainants before the learned NCDRC, the complaint does not set out,
with clarity, their individual grievances, out of the several grievances enumerated in para 16 of the
complaint. Rather, the use of the words ―many complainants(cid:129), ―some complainants(cid:129), and the like,
which figure in para 16 of the Complaint, indicate, prima facie, that the grievances of all allottees
were not identical, though, in the ultimate eventuate, their common aim might have been to secure
allotment to them, by the petitioners, of serviceable flats.
44. Such a common ultimate aim cannot, however, connote ―sameness of interest(cid:129) within the
meaning of Section 12(1)(c), or Section 2(1)(b)(iv), of the 1986 Act. The law enunciated in Brigade
Enterprises18 does not permit filing of a class action complaint under Section 12(1)(c) of the 1986
Act, in such a fashion. The matter is not merely one of the reliefs sought in the complaint. The 1986
Act offers protection to consumers against deficiencies in service or perpetration of unfair trade
practices. The relief that follows is merely a sequitur. The sameness of interest has to be with respect
to the grievances of the complainants, and not with respect to the reliefs sought. Pared down to
brass tacks, hypothetically, if one allottee is aggrieved by water leakage in the flat allotted to him,
another by not allotment of adequate parking space, a third by delayed allotment and a fourth by the
flat not being of the category assured to him, they cannot maintain a class action against the builder,
by invoking Section 12(1)(c), merely on the ground that the ultimate relief sought by all of them is
allotment Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022
15:58:14 of flats as originally contracted. Once, as in the present case (vide para 16 of the
Complaint), the complainants enumerated several individual items of grievance, the Complaint
would either have to assert that each grievance applied to each allottee whose cause they were
seeking to espouse, or to identify the allottees, grievance-wise. Else, the very requirement of
―sameness of interest(cid:129), in the case of a class action proceeding under the Consumer Protection Act,
would be reduced to a redundancy, as, in every case, the consumers could make an omnibus prayer
that the units should be allotted to them in good condition and, on that basis, plead sameness of
interest. This, in my view, militates against the law laid down in Brigade Enterprises18. To reiterate
what is required is that it must be apparent and forthcoming, from the complaint, that the
consumers whose cause the complaint seeks to espouse have sameness of interest, to the extent that
the deficiencies in the service provided by the service provider, qua each and all of the said
complainants, is the same. That requirement, in my considered opinion, is wanting in the complaint
filed by the respondents in the present case.
45. With greatest respect to the learned NCDRC, I am of the opinion that paras 5 to 7 of the
impugned order dated 16 th May, 2018 do not indicate that the learned NCDRC has approached the
matter of maintainability of the complaint as a class action in the manner envisaged by Brigade
Enterprises18. In fact, a reading of para 7 indicates that the learned NCDRC appears to have
proceeded on the basis of the omnibus prayer clause contained in the complaint.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/13785167/ 27Lucina Land Development Ltd vs Union Of India & Ors on 27 April, 2022
46. The learned NCDRC has also noted that the complainants had, Signature Not Verified Digitally
Signed By:SUNIL SINGH NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14 ―same interest in the outcome of
the complaint(cid:129). Such an approach in my considered and respectful opinion, cannot be accepted, in
view of the law laid down in Brigade Enterprises18. What is required is not sameness of interest in
the outcome of the complaint, but sameness of interest with respect to the grievances of the
complainants and the deficiencies in service that the complaints claimed to have suffered at the
instance of the opposite party. It is only then, that the Consumer Protection Forum could assess the
correctness of the allegation of deficiency of service on the part of the opposite party vis-a-vis the
complainants. Unless the consumers who have sameness of interest in respect of their grievances
vis-a-vis the opposite party were immediately identifiable from the complaint, the complaint cannot
be maintained as a class action covering the interest of all such consumers.
47. I am, therefore, unable to subscribe to the view expressed by the learned NCDRC in paras 5 to 7
of the impugned order dated 16 th May, 2018.
48. In my view, the complaint, as filed, does not indicate that, even in respect of 51 complainants
who were before the learned NCDRC, there is ―sameness of interest(cid:129) as could permit the complaint
to be maintained as a class action covering their grievances vis-a-vis the petitioners. The pleadings
in the compliant, are not sufficient to enable the Court to assess the number of complainants who
would have sameness of interest, in their grievances vis-a-vis the petitioners. It cannot, therefore, be
said that the consolidated claim of such Signature Not Verified Digitally Signed By:SUNIL SINGH
NEGI Signing Date:02.05.2022 15:58:14 complainants who would have sameness of interest would
be in excess of (cid:132) 1 crore.
49. The impugned order cannot, therefore, sustain.
50. Per consequence, the complaint filed by the petitioners cannot, applying the law laid down in
Brigade Enterprises18, and on the basis of the pleadings contained in the complaint, be maintained
as a class action in respect of all the allottees of the Indiabulls Greens, Panvel Project or even in
respect of the 51 complainants who approached the learned NCDRC.
51. The complaint would, therefore, necessarily have to be dismissed, as, in the manner in which it is
filed, it is not even apparent that the complaint is maintainable before the learned NCDRC.
52. Having said that, however, this order would not preclude the complainants from filing a proper
complaint, keeping in mind the observations contained hereinabove, as a class action proceeding
under Section 12(1)(c) or otherwise, before the appropriate forum, which might even be the learned
NCDRC. Any such complaint, if and when filed, would be decided by the concerned forum in
accordance with law and keeping in view the observations contained in the present judgment.
