JUDGMENT Jagannadha Rao, C.J.
1. This petition is filed for the issue of a writ of certiorari to quash Ext. P9 notice dated 26-11-1992
issued by the Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, Kottayam to the petitioner under the provisions
of the Consumer Protection Act 1986 and further for the issue of a writ of prohibition restraining the
Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum from proceeding on the basis of Ext. P 9. A writ of mandamus
is also sought to direct the State of Kerala to frame rules to safeguard the interests of persons like
the petitioner.
2. The contention of the petitioner is that the Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, the second
respondent, has no jurisdiction to issue the said notice inasmuch as the complainants (respondents
3 to 5) before the said Forum are not consumers vis-a-vis the petitioner Sri. A. V. Georgekutty, who
is the President of a Co-operative Bank. The following facts have to be stated for a proper
understanding of the point raised in this case. The writ petitioner is the President of the
Mulakkulam Panchayat Co-operative Bank, Peruva, which is registered as a Society under the Kerala
Co-operative Societies Act, 1969. Respondents 3 to 5 in the writ petition filed O.P. No. 891 of 1992
before the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, Kottayam (2nd respondent) for grant of
compensation of Rs. 10,000/ - for refusal of the Bank to grant loans each of Rs. 5,000/-, even after
sanction. Byelaws 48, 49, and 50 (marked as Ext. P2) permit the Directors to recommend loan
applications and the Board, after due inquiry, is empowered to take a decision in the interests of the
Bank and in accordance with the byelaws. The Board has also power to cancel loans already granted
if the loan is not for a bona fide requirement. In the present case the loans applied for by
respondents 3 to 5 have not been granted because of the petitions filed by the son of the 3rd
respondent and the father of the 4th respondent etc. The Board submitted a report on 29-6-1992
(Ext. P5) that if loans are granted to respondents 3 to 5, that will result in losses to the Bank. The
Board refused to grant the loans and then respondents 3 to 5 filed the O. P. 891 of 1992 before the
District Forum claiming compensation on the ground that they were 'consumers' within Section 2(d)
of the Act. The writ petitioners filed two counter affidavits (Exts. P 6 and P 7) and the matter was
heard and Judgment reserved. At that stage, respondents 3 to 5 filed a petition to implead the
Directors of the Bank. The petition is Ext. P8. The District Forum ordered notice as per Ext. P9. The
petitioner objected stating that the main case itself is not maintainable and the same may be decided
as a preliminary point. But without deciding the same the case was posted to 5-3-1993. Then the
present writ petition is filed for questioning Ext. P 8 petition and Ext. P 9 notice and for the issue of
a writ of prohibition etc.
3. The main contention of the writ petitioner is that the respondents 3 to 5 to whom grant of loan is
refused by the Bank, are not 'consumers' within Section 2(d) of the Consumers' Protection Act, 1986
as they have neither purchased any article nor hired any service from the Bank. Service, unless it is
rendered for consideration, cannot fall within Section 2(d). The respondents 3 to, 5, being
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1120922/ 1A.V. Georgekutty vs State Of Kerala And Ors. on 10 March, 1993
share-holders of the Bank, cannot have a claim as consumers, Their remedy is only by raising a
dispute before the Registrar of Co-operative Societies under Section 69 of the Co-operative Societies
Act. When the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is ousted under the Co-operative Societies Act, the
District Forum cannot have jurisdiction under the Consumer Protection Act. The motive of
respondents 3 to 5 is said to be to obtain a conviction from the District Forum and disqualify the
Directors as members of the Bank which is a Co-operative Society. It is stated that the members of
the District Forum, other than the retired District Judge, are appointed on political considerations.
4. The point that arises for consideration in this writ petition is whether persons who are impleaded
as respondents before the District Forum or the State Commission can be permitted to move the
High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India for the issue of a writ of certiorari or
prohibition or other reliefs?
5. The preamble to the Act provides that the Act is intended for the protection of the interests of the
consumers and for that purpose to make provisions for the establishment of consumer Councils and
other authorities for the settlement of consumer disputes and for matters connected therewith. The
Statement of Objects and Reasons attached to the Bill states :
"The Consumer Protection Bill 1986 seeks to provide for better protection of the interests of
consumers and for that purpose, to make provision for the establishment of Consumer Councils and
other authorities for the settlement of consumer disputes and for matters connected therewith.
....................
To provide speedy and simple redressal to consumer disputes, a quasi-judicial machinery is sought
to be set up at the District, State and Central levels. These quasi-judicial bodies will observe the
principles of natural justice and have been empowered to give reliefs of a specific nature and to
award, wherever appropriate, compensation to consumers. Penalties for non-compliance of the
orders given by the quasi-judicial bodies have also been provided."
5A. Section 2 of the Act defines 'complaint', 'consumer', 'consumer dispute' etc. Section 2(h) defines
'District Forums' as the one established under Section 9(a). Section 2(k) defines 'National
Commission' as the forum established under Section 9(c). Section 2(o) defines 'service'. Section 2(3)
provides that the provisions' of the Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions
of any other law for the time being in force. Chapter II provides for the establishment of the Central
Consumer Protection Council. Section 7 provides for establishment of the State Consumer
Protection Council. Chapter III deals with redressai of consumer disputes. Under Section 9,
Consumer Dispute Redressai Forum known as 'District Forum' is to be established by the State
Government with the prior approval of the Central Government in each district of the State.
Similarly, at the State level, the Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission is to be established under
Section 9(b) and is to be known as the 'State Commission'. We then have the National Consumer
Dispute Redressai Commission to be established by the Central Government under Section 9(c). So
far as Andhra Pradesh is concerned, the District Forum and State Commission have been
established. The National Commission has also been established by the Central Government.

Section 12 provides for the manner in which a complaint is to be made, while Section 13 deals with
the procedure to be followed on receipt of the complaint. Section 13(4) applies a few provisions of
the Civil Procedure Code to the District Forum. Section 14 deals with the finding to be given by the
District Forum. An appeal is provided to the State Commission against the orders of the District
Forum. The appeal is to be filed within thirty days from the date of the order of the District Forum.
Section 17 deals with the jurisdiction of the State Commission, while Section 18 deals with the
procedure applicable thereto. Section 19 provides for a further appeal to the National Commission
against the orders passed by the State Commission in exercise of its powers conferred under
sub-clause (i) of Sub-section (a) of Section 17. An appeal to the National Commission is also to be
filed within thirty days. Power is given to the State Commission as well as to the National
Commission to entertain the appeal beyond thirty days. Section 21 deals with the jurisdiction of the
National Commission, while Section 22 deals with the procedure applicable thereto. Section 23 is
important and it provides that any person aggrieved by an order made by the National Commission
in exercise of its powers conferred under Sub-clause (i) of subsection (a), Section 21 may prefer an
appeal against such an order to the Supreme Court within a period of thirty days from the date of
the order. However, the Supreme Court will entertain appeals after thirty days is sufficient cause is
shown. Section 24 provides that every order of the District Forum, the State Commission or the
National Commission shall, if no appeal has been filed against such an order under the Act, be final.
5-B. Coming to the question of execution of the orders, there is a separate provision under Section
25 for enforcement of the orders of the District Forum, State Commission and the National
Commission as if they were decrees or orders made by the court in a suit. Section 26 provides for
dismissal of frivolous and vexatious complaints. Section 27 provides for penalties and states that
where a trade or a person against whom a complaint is made fails or omits to comply with any order
made by the District Forum, the State Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be,
such trader or person shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than
one month and which may extend to three years or with fine which shall not be less than Rs.
2,000/-, but which may extend to Rs. 10,000/- or the punishment may be by way of imprisonment
as well as fine.
5-C. The Rules also provide for speedy and efficacious disposal of the matters.
Consumer Protection (Kerala) Rules, 1987 provides in sub-rule (9) of R. 7 as follows :--
"While proceeding under sub-rule (8), the State Commission may, on such terms as it may think fit
and at any stage, adjourn the hearing of the complaint but not more than one adjournment shall
ordinarily be given and the complaint should be decided within 90 days from the date of notice
received by the opposite party where complaint does not require analysis of testing of the goods and
within 150 days if it requires analysis or testing of the goods."
Similarly so far as the State Commission is concerned, it is provided in Sub-rule (8) of Rule 8 as
follows :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1120922/ 3A.V. Georgekutty vs State Of Kerala And Ors. on 10 March, 1993
"State Commission may, on such terms as it may think fit and at any stage, adjourn the hearing of
appeal, but not more than one adjournment shall ordinarily be given and the appeal, should be
decided within 90 days from the first date of hearing."
From a reading of the above provisions of the Act and the Rules it is clear that separate Forums are
constituted by the Legislature at the District level, at the State level and at the National level.
Complaints can be lodged before the District Forum and in certain type of cases before the State
Forum. Appeals against the orders of the District Forum lie to the State Forum. Against the orders of
State Forum an appeal will lie to the National Commission. A further appeal lies to the Supreme
Court against the orders of the National Commission. Appeals are normally to be preferred within
30 days. The complaints are to be disposed of within 90 days in cases where the dispute does not
involve any analysis or testing. On the other hand, if it involves any analysis or testing, the
complaints have to be disposed of within 150 days. The intention of the Legislature appears to be, to
provide for a speedy and efficacious remedy by resolving consumer disputes. In fact, the Statement
of Objects and Reasons clearly mentioned that the Act is intended to provide speedy and simple
redressal to consumer disputes by providing a self-contained quasi-judicial machinery.
6. It is in the context of the prescription of hierarchy of separate Forums under the Act that we have
to consider the question as to whether the parties can move this court under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India for the issue of a writ of prohibition. It is true that whenever the Legislature
creates a separate tribunal with a hierarchy of appeals, the jurisdiction of the High Courts under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India to deal with the orders passed by the said Tribunals is not
and cannot be ousted. It is also true that whenever [questions of jurisdiction are raised, the High
'Court normally permits such questions to be raised under Article 226 of the Constitution and
examines whether the applications or the other proceedings filed before the Tribunal are within the
jurisdiction of the said Tribunal or not. But the High Court has a discretion to entertain the writ
petitions. It is not as if the High Court is bound to entertain every writ 'petition which raises a
question of jurisdiction ' of a tribunal. In this connection reference is to be made to the decision of
the Supreme Court in First Income-tax Officer, Salem v. Short Brothers (P) Ltd., AIR 1967 SC 81. In
that case the Supreme Court observed while dealing with the question of issue of writ of prohibition
that issuance of a writ of prohibition is discretionary with the High Court, particularly when the
petitioner has an alternative remedy which is adequate and efficacious.
7. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986, has created a hierarchy of bodies under the Act with the
power to hear appeals at every stage. The intention of the Legislature appears to be that the District
Forum or the State Commission as well as the National Commission should be allowed to perform
their duties speedily and without any interruption. The District Forum is presided over either by a
District Judge or by a retired District Judge. The State Commissions are presided over by a person
who is a Judge of a High Court or a retired Judge of a High Court. Surely the litigant cannot be
permitted to say that the District Judge at the level of the District Forum or a sitting or retired Judge
of the High Court at the level of State Commission is not competent to decide a question of
jurisdiction. The Presiding Officers of these bodies, having worked for a long period as either
District Judges or High Court Judges, are fully experienced to decide questions of jurisdiction,
however complicated. They are not like certain executive authorities who have no judicial
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1120922/ 4A.V. Georgekutty vs State Of Kerala And Ors. on 10 March, 1993
experience. To say that the bodies presided over by such persons cannot be allowed to decide
jurisdictional issues, cannot be accepted. It is well settled that such bodies are entitled to decide
whether they have jurisdiction to decide a dispute and whether the complainant before them is a
consumer or not within Section 2(d). The intention of Parliament will, in our opinion, be defeated if
initially objections as to jurisdiction are permitted to be raised before the High Court under Article
226 of the Constitution. Merely because a question of jurisdiction arises in such cases, the High
Court should not, in our opinion, feel it ordinarily imperative to admit such writ petitions. If the writ
petitions are admitted merely because there is the question of jurisdiction of the District Forum or
the State Commission or the National Commission, the proceedings before the said authorities are
bound to be delayed and the very purpose of establishing these Forums will be frustrated.
8. If writ petitions are entertained and ultimately dismissed by the High Court, then the parties
would necessarily avail the further remedy by way of appeal to a Division Bench and then a further
appeal to the Supreme Court under Articles 133 and 136 of the Constitution of India. If the writ is
not issued, then, the complaint before the Forum would have to be heard. This will entail lot of
delay. The High Courts are already burdened with heavy arrears and that is the precise reason why
separate hierarchy of bodies is created under the Consumer Protection Act. It is therefore not wise
for this court ordinarily to undertake the burden of deciding such disputes, even if they relate to
jurisdiction.
9. What we have stated above is to be the normal rule. There may indeed be rare cases which are
expressly excluded by the very provisions of the Consumer Protection Act or other rare cases which
may warrant interference by the High Court. But that should be la rare exception and not the rule.
10. At the same time we wish to add that the District Forum and the State Commission must be
careful in entertaining complaints. They must see that their jurisdiction is not abused. They must
not give scope for complainants harassing persons who do not come within the scope of the Act.
When the High Court is acting with restraint in entertaining writ petitions as stated above, there is a
greater responsibility of the District Forum and the State Commission to see that their jurisdiction is
not invoked without sufficient justification.
11. We are in agreement with the decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Tulasi Enterprises v.
Andhra Pradesh State Consumer Commission, Hyderabad, AIR 1991 Andh Pra 326 to which one of
us was a party. We respectfully dissent from the decision of the Calcutta High Court in Calcutta
Metropolitan Development Authority v. Union of India, AIR 1993 Cal 4. We agree with the decision
of the Delhi High Court in M/s. Ansal Properties and Industries (P) Ltd. v. Shri Chander Bhan Kohli
(1991) 1 CPJ 679 wherein it has been held that when the Consumer Protection Act provides a
machinery, including an appeal to the Supreme Court, it would not be proper for the High Court to
entertain a writ petition.
12. Coming to the facts of this case, we are of the view that the question of jurisdiction raised in this
case can very well be (decided by the District Forum. The case is not one where the express
provisions of the Act exclude entertaining such a complaint. Nor is the case one which can be treated
as a rare case in which this court should intervene. We therefore consider it not necessary to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1120922/ 5A.V. Georgekutty vs State Of Kerala And Ors. on 10 March, 1993
entertain the question of jurisdiction raised before us in this writ petition.
13. So far as the allegation that the members are appointed on political considerations is concerned,
the same cannot be accepted. So far as the framing of new rules is concerned, the Consumer
Protection (Kerala) Rules, 1987 has been made by the Government in exercise of the powers
conferred by Sub-section (2) of Section 30 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (Central Act 68 of
1986), for the smooth and efficient functioning of the various bodies under the Act and therefore no
mandamus need be issued to the State Government to make further rules.
The writ petition is accordingly dismissed.
