COMMON ORDER
MOHAMMED SHAFFIQ, J.
These writ petitions are filed Praying for a writ of certiorarified mandamus to quash the order of the
first Respondent /Tribunal and direct the third respondent to grant deduction on the freight charges
received by the petitioner towards the crude oil supplied to its customer viz., M/s. Madras Refineries
Ltd, (hereinafter referred to as "MRL"). https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P. Nos.20503 to 20505
of 2007
2. At the outset, it may be relevant to set out the facts very briefly:
The petitioner is a Government of India undertaking engaged in exploring Crude Oil
in the Cauvery Basin in the State of Tamil Nadu. The crude oil pumped out from the
oil wells at Nannilam and Narimanam was transported to the oil storage point of the
petitioner at Nagapattinam through pipelines. The oil is transported to the storing
point of the petitioner at Tondiarpet in Chennai through trucks by road or in railway
wagons. Thereafter, in terms of the directions given by the Ministry of Petroleum and
Natural Gas, the Crude Oil was pumped through pipelines to the storage tank of MRL
to whom the crude oil was sold. It is pertinent to mention here that the petitioner was
under an obligation to sell the entire stock of crude oil only to MRL. The quantum of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74815763/ 2M/S.Oil And Natural Gas Commission vs The Tamil Nadu Sales Tax Appellate ... on 29 July, 2022
crude oil pumped through pipelines into the storage tank of MRL was acknowledged/
ascertained after removal of Base Sediment and Water (BS & W) and the certificate
was issued by MRL only for the quantity so acknowledged/ ascertained. The Central
Excise Officers stationed at MRL would certify the quantity delivered to MRL and
CESS was payable only on the acknowledged quantity i.e., after removal of Base
Sediment and Water (BS & W).
3. In the above background, the question arises as to whether the freight charges for the transport of
crude oil from the oil well at Narimanam to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P. Nos.20503 to
20505 of 2007 the storage tank of MRL, were pre-sale expenses and thus, form part of turnover.
Since, in the view of the Revenue, the delivery/sale concluded only when crude oil was pumped to
the storage tank of MRL, the orders of assessment were made treating the transportation/freight
charges as taxable turnover, liable to tax and the assessing authority also proceeded to levy penalty.
The orders of assessment were confirmed by the First Appellate authority and the Tribunal.
4. For better appreciation, it may be relevant to set out the findings of the Tribunal, which are under
challenge in these writ petitions, while confirming the rejection of the claim of deduction on freight
charges made by the petitioner. Findings of the Tribunal:
"1. Though the freight charges are charged separately in the invoices raised, such
freight are in the nature of partial re-imbursement.
2. The buyers Tvl.MRL were not prepared to take delivery of the oil at the oil wells at
Narimanam or at the storing point at Nagapattinam. It is not proved by the appellant
that the crude oil was transported at the risk of the buyers and the appellant had no
responsibility of any kind as soon as the oil was loaded in the lorry or railway wagons
at Nagapattinam.
3. There was no physical delivery or appropriation of the goods at the oil wells at
Narimanam or at the storing point at Nagapattinam.
4. Passing of the property of the goods took place at Tvl.MRL, Manali after
ascertainment of the quantity of crude oil as per the method adopted in the intake
certificate prepared in the presence of the Excise officials.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P. Nos.20503 to 20505 of 2007
5. The appellant had chosen to prepare the sale invoices at Madras only after getting
intake certificate from Tvl.MRL on weekly basis for the quantity ascertained.
6. The appellant was not aware of the actual quantity, the value of crude oil and the
gravity of the crude oil supplied to the buyers, when the despatch started at
Nagapattinam. These were arrived at only after the crude oil was pumpted to
Tvl.MRL through pipelines from the storing point of the appellant at Tondiarpet.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74815763/ 3M/S.Oil And Natural Gas Commission vs The Tamil Nadu Sales Tax Appellate ... on 29 July, 2022
7. There cannot be delivery Ex-Narimanam since the crude oil was transported to
Tondiarpet storing point at the appellant's risk and the Central Excise Authorities
took the quantum of crude oil supplied to Tvl.MRL at Tondiarpet storing point when
it is pumped into the storing tank of Tondiarpet.
8. The crude oil cannot be considered to have become the property of the buyers at
Narimanam in that the appellant had undertaken to transport the crude oil through
railway wagons or lorry to the Tondiarpet storing point and it was practically at
Tondiarpet did the crude oil pass on the buyers Tvl.MRL and therefore the
transportation of crude oil from Narimanam/ Nagapattinam to Tondiarpet has to be
held as that of the appellant in connection with the ultimate sale of goods."
5. With the above findings, the Tribunal upheld the orders passed by the Assessing Officer as well as
the First Appellate Authority on the premise that the sale took place at the point of time, when the
crude oil was delivered into the tank of MRL and not at Narimanam as claimed by the petitioner and
thus, the transport charges were liable to tax under the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act, 1959
(hereinafter referred to as the "TNGST Act, 1959"). https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.
Nos.20503 to 20505 of 2007
6. Aggrieved by the above order of the Tribunal, the petitioner has filed these writ petitions.
7.1. (a)The thrust of the argument of the learned senior counsel for the petitioner is that in terms of
Explanation 3 to Section 2(n) of the TNGST Act, 1959, the goods were appropriated at Nannilam
and Narimanam and on such appropriation, MRL becomes the owner of the crude oil i.e., on
removal at Narimanam. The sale price was Ex-Narimanam and not inclusive of transportation/
freight charges. The transportation charges did not form part of the consideration for the sale of
crude oil and was in-fact reimbursement of the actual transportation charges incurred for
transportation of the crude oil from Narimanam to MRL. It is further contended that once the goods
are identified/ appropriated, the sale is complete in terms of Explanation 3 to Section 2 (n) of the
TNGST Act, 1959.
(b)The appeals filed for the assessment years 1988-89 to 1991-92, have been allowed, accepting the
petitioner's claim for deduction of freight charges from taxable turnover.
(c)During the assessment year 1992-93, the sale price was fixed by the Government of India with
effect from 16.09.1992 at Rs.2720 per metric ton and the break up of the same was given as follows:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P. Nos.20503 to 20505 of 2007 Basic price
-Rs.1506 per metric ton Cess - Rs.900 per metric ton Royalty - Rs.314 per metric ton
(d)The price was ex-factory, which indicated that the sale is also ex-factory and thus,
the freight charges would not form part of the sale price/ taxable turnover.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74815763/ 4M/S.Oil And Natural Gas Commission vs The Tamil Nadu Sales Tax Appellate ... on 29 July, 2022
7.2. It is also submitted by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner that the transportation
charges do not form part of the sale consideration for the sale of crude oil by the petitioner to MRL
as the transaction was governed by the policy Instructions issued by the Oil Co-ordination
Committee and there is no reference about freight charges in the said instructions. Therefore, the
learned senior counsel prayed for allowing these writ petitions by setting aside the order of the
Tribunal.
8. To the contrary, the learned Additional Government Pleader (Taxes) appearing for the Revenue
submitted that the freight charges are pre-sale expenses and liable to be taxed. It is further
submitted that the property passed from the petitioner to MRL only when it was delivered at the
storage point of MRL at Chennai, as evident from the fact that the measurements were taken after
removal of Base Sediments and Water (BS & W) at the storage point of MRL
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P. Nos.20503 to 20505 of 2007 which is indicative that the
property and the risk continued to remain with the petitioner until then. It is also submitted that the
MRL cannot take delivery at the oil well at Narimanam or Nannilam and by the very nature of the
goods involved in the transaction, it was necessary for the petitioner to deliver the goods at the
storage point of MRL. The petitioner's submission on the basis of Explanation 3 to Section 2(n) of
the TNGST Act, 1959 is wholly misplaced and that appropriation by itself would not result in
completed sale and thus, the same is liable to be rejected.
9. Heard both sides.
10. It appears to us that the writ petitions must fail for the following reasons:
Failure to challenge the orders of assessment for the earlier period:
The submission of the petitioner that for the assessment years 1988-89 to 1991-92,
the appeals have been allowed excluding freight charges and the same has attained
finality and thus, it is not permissible for the Revenue to take a contrary view, needs
to be rejected for two reasons:
a. There is no res-judicata in tax matters, the liability to pay tax from year to year is a
separate and distinct liability; it is based on a different cause of
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P. Nos.20503 to 20505 of 2007 action from year
to year. The said position would be clear from the following judgments:
i) BSNL v. Union of India, [(2006) 3 SCC 1].
ii) Amalgamated Coalfields No. (2) [1963 Supp (1) SCR 172 : AIR 1964 SC 1013] , SCR
p. 184]
iii) Devi lal Modi vs. STO, [AIR 1965 SC 1150].
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74815763/ 5M/S.Oil And Natural Gas Commission vs The Tamil Nadu Sales Tax Appellate ... on 29 July, 2022
b. Secondly, it has been held repeatedly by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that if a question of law is
raised, the mere fact that the Revenue may not have challenged for some other assessment years or
for some other assessee by itself will not preclude the Revenue from contesting the issue. The said
position would be clear from the judgment in the case of Catholic Syrian Bank Ltd. v. CIT, [(2012) 3
SCC 784], wherein it was held as under:
"15. The appellant has contended that similar claims had been decided in favour of
the banks for Assessment Years 1991-1992 to 1993- 1994, by the Special Bench of
ITAT, which had not been challenged by the Department. As such, the issue had
attained finality and could not be disturbed in the subsequent years.
16. The above contention of the appellant Bank does not impress us at all. Merely
because the orders of the Special Bench of ITAT were not assailed in appeal by the
Department itself, this would not take away the right of the Revenue to question the
correctness of the orders of assessment, particularly when a question of law is
involved....."
11. Having rejected the preliminary submission of the petitioner, we shall now proceed to examine
the issue involved herein, on merits:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P. Nos.20503 to 20505 of 2007 I. Equating
appropriation with sale – misconception:
(i) The submission of the petitioner that the sale occurs on appropriation of the crude
oil at Narimanam, where the crude oil was extracted, overlooks the fact that
appropriation is mere earmarking, setting apart or identification and cannot be
equated with a completed transaction of sale. The mere factum of the goods being
earmarked/ appropriated would not by itself result in the transaction constituting a
completed sale nor would it clothe the authority the jurisdiction to levy tax on the
basis of mere appropriation in the absence of transfer of property which is essential
to constitute a sale. This would be evident if in a particular case after the goods have
been identified / earmarked / appropriated, but the goods are destroyed before the
property in the goods passes to the buyer, there cannot be any levy in such
circumstances for there is no completed sale.
(ii) At this juncture, it may also be relevant to refer to the definition of “sale” under
Section 2(n) of the TNGST Act, 1959.
"Section 2(n) “sale” with all its grammatical variations and cognate expressions
means every transfer of the property in goods (other than by way of mortgage,
hypothecation, charge or pledge) by one person to another in the course of business
for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration and includes –
(i)...... "
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74815763/ 6M/S.Oil And Natural Gas Commission vs The Tamil Nadu Sales Tax Appellate ... on 29 July, 2022
(iii) A reading of the above provision would show that to constitute "sale", the following ingredients
must be present and satisfied:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P. Nos.20503 to 20505 of 2007 a. There must be
transfer of property in goods.
b. Such transfer must be from one person to another.
c. It must be in the course of business.
d. It must be for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration.
(iv) It would thus be clear that in the absence of transfer of property in goods, there
cannot be a completed sale and thus, the argument of the petitioner that the
appropriation results in completed sale and once the goods are appropriated, the sale
would also stand completed, needs to be rejected as the acceptance of such argument
would result in levying the transactions on the basis of mere appropriation falling
short of sale, which would be beyond the pale of Entry 54 of List II to the VII
Schedule to the Constitution of India. It may also be relevant to clarify that under
Entry 54 of List II to the VII Schedule of the Constitution of India as it existed during
the relevant period in question, the power of the State to levy tax extended to levying
tax on what would constitute sale within the meaning of "Sale of Goods Act, 1930"
and the 6 categories of mutant sales which were deemed to be sales pursuant to the
46th Amendment to the Constitution of India. However, the acceptance of the
submission of the petitioner that the appropriation of goods towards a contract of
sale would confer competence to levy tax under Entry 54 of List II to the VII Schedule
of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P. Nos.20503 to 20505 of 2007
Constitution of India, would result in extending the charge/ levy to a transaction,
which neither falls within the meaning of “sale” in terms of the "Sale of Goods Act,
1930" nor within the 6 categories of mutant sales which are deemed to be sales
pursuant to the 46th Amendment to the Constitution of India. In other words, it
results in creating a seventh category of fictional sale which is clearly beyond the pale
of Entry 54 of List II to the VII Schedule read with Article 366 (29 A) of the
Constitution of India. In this regard, it may be relevant to refer to the following
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in BSNL v. Union of India [(2006) 3 SCC 1],
wherein it was held as under:
"36. Following the ratio in Gannon Dunkerley[State of Madrasÿv.ÿGannon Dunkerley
& Co. (Madras) Ltd., (1958) 9 STC 353 : AIR 1958 SC 560 : 1959 SCR 379] that “sale”
in Entry 48 must be construed as having the same meaning which it has in the Sale of
Goods Act, 1930, this Court as well as the High Courts held that several composite
transactions in which there was an element of sale were not liable to sales tax.
.......
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74815763/ 7M/S.Oil And Natural Gas Commission vs The Tamil Nadu Sales Tax Appellate ... on 29 July, 2022
43.Gannon Dunkerley [State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley & Co. (Madras) Ltd.,
(1958) 9 STC 353 : AIR 1958 SC 560 : 1959 SCR 379] survived the Forty-sixth
Constitutional Amendment in two respects. First with regard to the definition of
“sale” for the purposes of the Constitution in general and for the purposes of Entry 54
of List II in particular except to the extent that the clauses in Article 366(29-A)
operate. By introducing separate categories of “deemed sales”, the meaning of the
word “goods” was not altered. Thus the definitions of the composite elements of a
sale such as intention of the parties, goods, delivery, etc. would continue to be
defined according to known legal connotations. This does not mean that the content
of the concepts remain static. The courts must move with the times. [See Attorney
General v. Edison Telephone Co. of London Ltd., (1880) 6 QBD 244 : 43 LT 697] But
the Forty-sixth Amendment does not give a licence, for example, to assume that a
transaction is a sale and then to look around for what could be the goods. The word
“goods” has not been altered by the Forty-sixth Amendment. That ingredient of a sale
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P. Nos.20503 to 20505 of 2007 continues to
have the same definition. The second respect in which Gannon Dunkerley [State of
Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley & Co.
(Madras) Ltd., (1958) 9 STC 353 : AIR 1958 SC 560 : 1959 SCR 379] has survived is with reference to
the dominant nature test to be applied to a composite transaction not covered by Article 366(29-A).
Transactions which are mutant sales are limited to the clauses of Article 366(29-A). All other
transactions would have to qualify as sales within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 for the
purpose of levy of sales tax.”
(v) It is clear that any transaction other than the six categories of deemed sales must qualify as a sale
within the meaning of Sale of Goods Act, 1930, and the submission of the petitioner, equating
appropriation to “sale” is in gross disregard to the scheme of tax on sales under the Constitution of
India and also the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 and TNGST Act, 1959, thus, needs to be rejected.
II. Equating fixing of situs of sale with time of sale – misconception:
(i) In the case of unascertained / future goods, the sale is deemed to take place inside
the State, where it is appropriated. To appreciate the need to fix the situs of a sale in a
particular State, it may be relevant to have a look at the historical background leading
to the Constitutional and Statutory amendment.
The need to fix the situs of sale was, in view of the fact that multiple States levied tax on the same
transaction of sale by looking to the different ingredients of sale to assume jurisdiction resulting in a
transaction of sale being subject to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P. Nos.20503 to 20505 of
2007 multiple levies. This is in view of the fact that situs of an intangible concept like a sale can only
be fixed notionally either by the legislature having the competence or by Judge made law. As a
matter of fact, prior to the 6th Amendment to the Constitution of India, different States adopted
different tests to decide the situs of a sale to assume jurisdiction to levy tax on sale of goods.
Resultantly, a transaction of sale was subjected to tax by more than one State. Since some States
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74815763/ 8M/S.Oil And Natural Gas Commission vs The Tamil Nadu Sales Tax Appellate ... on 29 July, 2022
fixed the situs on the basis of the place where the contract is made, while another set of States
looked to the place where property passes and the third set of States looked to the State of
consumption.
(ii) It is with a view to remedy the above mischief, Parliament was conferred with the authority to
formulate the principles for determining, when a sale or purchase of goods takes place outside the
State in terms of Article 286(2) of the Constitution of India. The Parliament in exercise of its power
under Article 286(2) of the Constitution of India, had introduced Section 4 of the CST Act, 1956
formulating the principles, as to when a sale or purchase is said to take place outside a State.
Importantly, Section 4 of the CST Act, 1956 has been incorporated by almost every State Legislature
including the State of Tamil Nadu in its law providing for levy of tax on sale or purchase of goods, as
would be clear from a reading of Explanation 3 to Section 2(n) of the TNGST Act, 1959. The relevant
sections are tabulated hereunder:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P. Nos.20503 to 20505 of 2007 Section 4 of the
CST Act, 1956 Explanation 3 to Section 2(n) of the TNGST Act, 1959
4. When is a sale or purchase of goods said to Explanation (3)-(a) The sale of

the goods are within the State-

time the or by the purchaser, whether the assent of the contract of sale is made; and (b) in the case

assent of Explanation (3)-(b) Where there is single the other party is prior or subsequent to such

more places than one, the provisions of single contract of sale or purchase of goods clause (a) shall
apply as if there were separate situated at more places than one, the contracts in respect of the goods
at each of provisions of this sub-section shall apply as if such places. there were separate contracts in
respect of the goods at each of such places.
(iii) The submission of the petitioner that the sale is completed the moment the goods were
appropriated at Nannilam or Narimanam, proceeds on a misconception and overlooks the position
that the act of appropriation i.e., earmarking, setting apart or identifying the goods, is relevant only
for the limited purpose of fixing the situs of sale in the case of unascertained or future goods and the
same would be relevant only where there is a completed sale. Appropriation by itself would not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74815763/ 9M/S.Oil And Natural Gas Commission vs The Tamil Nadu Sales Tax Appellate ... on 29 July, 2022
result in a completed transaction of sale, unless and until it is accompanied by a transfer of property
from the seller to the buyer https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P. Nos.20503 to 20505 of 2007 for
consideration. It may be necessary to note that while passing of property is an essential ingredient
for a sale, the same has been left out by the Parliament only while determining the situs of sale and
not from being an essential ingredient of sale. In this regard, it may be relevant to refer to the
judgment of the Delhi High Court in the case of Indian Wood Products Co. Ltd. v. Sales Tax Officer
[21 STC 437], wherein it was held as under:
“8. ...... Under the said Section 4(2)(b) the place of sale depends upon the location of
the goods at the time of their appropriation to the contract of sale......... The term
“appropriation” has not been defined and in the primary sense “to appropriate” is to
set apart a thing with common consent as the property of a buyer and where a person
is entitled to goods which form part of a larger quantity and are not earmarked and
afterwards, the rest and set apart for him, they are said to be appropriated. In the
other sense, it may mean a final appropriation of the goods to the contract so as to
pass the property therein to the buyer. Consequently, when goods are selected with
the common consent of the parties there may be appropriation of the goods to the
contract even though the property has not passed. The scheme of the Sales Tax Act
goes to show that the Parliament left out of account the element of passing of
property as of any relevance in determining the situs of sale and the question of
appropriation of goods has to be decided irrespective of the passing of property.
9. In other words, the appropriation referred to in Section 4(2)(b) connotes the
setting apart of goods as specific goods to be delivered under the contract of sale and
not an appropriation linked with passing of property. The term ‘unconditional
appropriation existed in the Sale of Goods Act years before the enactment of the
Central Sales Tax Act, and if the Parliament intended to convey the same idea, the
Parliament would not have omitted the word “unconditionally” in Section 4(2)(b).”
(emphasis supplied)
(iv) It is thus clear that the Parliament and the State Legislature have looked to
appropriation only for the purpose of fixing the situs of sale. The
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P. Nos.20503 to 20505 of 2007 transfer of
property has not been dispensed with, while examining, whether a transaction would
constitute a "sale" or otherwise. In the absence of transfer of property, situs becomes
irrelevant, as there is no completed sale. Therefore, the submission of the petitioner
in looking to appropriation not only for fixing the situs, but also for determining the
time of sale, is lacking merit.
III. Deduction of freight under Rule 6(c) (i) of the TNGST Rules, 1959:
(i) To examine the claim of deduction of freight charges, while arriving at the taxable
turnover, it may be relevant to refer to Rule 6(c)(i) of the TNGST Rules, 1959, which
reads as under :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74815763/ 10M/S.Oil And Natural Gas Commission vs The Tamil Nadu Sales Tax Appellate ... on 29 July, 2022
"Rule 6:
“The tax or taxes under Section 3 or 4 shall be levied on the taxable turnover of the
dealer. In determining the taxable turnover, the amounts specified in the following
clauses shall, subject to the conditions specified therein, be deducted from the total
turnover of a dealer;
a) ....
b) ....
c) all amounts falling under the following three heads when specified and charged for
by the dealer separately, without including them in the price of the goods sold:-
i) freight;
......”
(ii) The above Rule is pari materia to the definition of “sale price” under Section 2(h) of the CST Act,
1956. The above provisions have come up for consideration on numerous occasions before this
Court and the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the following position appears to emerge:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P. Nos.20503 to 20505 of 2007 a. Deduction of
freight charges from turnover under Rule 6 (c)(i) of TNGST Rules, is admissible only
if the two conditions set-out therein viz., (i) Freight must not be included in the price
of the goods sold; and (ii) The amount charged by way of freight must be specified
and charged separately, are cumulatively satisfied.
The examination of the 1st condition viz., whether freight forms part of the price of
goods sold, would necessarily lead one to the question as to when the sale was
completed, for which, the consistent view taken is that the expenses incurred for
making the goods available to the purchaser or pre-sale expenses, would be liable to
tax. The said test is also applicable, while examining the claim of deduction of freight
from turnover while arriving at taxable turnover. The expenditure incurred by way of
freight upto the place of sale, would form part of the price of the goods sold. If the
seller is under an obligation to transport/ carry the goods to the destination of the
purchaser, and if it is shown that the risk is borne by the seller until the goods are
delivered at the buyers premises in discharging his obligation to the purchaser under
the contract of sale and such obligation is not discharged in the capacity of an agent
of the purchaser after completion of sale, it appears that the freight would form part
of the price and then irrespective of whether the same is shown separately or
otherwise, the same would form part of taxable turnover liable to tax.

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P. Nos.20503 to 20505 of 2007 b. Price Ex-
Factory or Works – Not conclusive delivery Ex-Factory:
In the present case, the Price is Ex-Factory at Narimannam/Nannilam.
However, the same may have no relevance in deciding the claim of deduction of
freight, while determining the taxable turnover. This is in view of the fact that while
the price may be ex-works, but if the delivery is not, in which case, freight cannot be
deducted from the taxable turnover, then the obligation to pay the freight was on the
seller/ petitioner as there was no sale at all, unless the goods were delivered at the
premises/storage tanks of the buyer. Applying the said reasoning to the facts of the
present case, it appears that the delivery is only at MRL premises and the sale is
complete only when oil is pumped into the storage tank of MRL, which would be
evident from the fact that the measurement was taken after removal of Base
Sediment and Water (BS&W) at the premises of MRL. The transfer of title to the
goods thus passes at the place of delivery i.e., premises of the buyer. Though the
contract mentioned the price as ex-factory price, the delivery was not at the factory
gate and thus freight may not be entitled for deduction. In this regard, it may be
relevant to refer to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in India Meters Ltd v.
State of Tamil Nadu [(2010) 9 SCC 423], wherein while dealing with the claim of
deduction of freight, the relevance of Ex-factory price was considered. The relevant
paragraphs of the said decision may be set out hereunder:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P. Nos.20503 to 20505 of 2007 “8.According to
the clause provided in the contract the transfer of title to the goods was to take place
only on delivery of goods at the customer's place and that the customer's obligation to
pay would arise only after the delivery had been so affected. The contract also
provided in the clause dealing with the price that it was payable per unit ex-factory
delivery. It provided for the payment of excise duty and statutory levies, in addition
to such ex-factory price, as also the fact that the ex-factory price mentioned was
exclusive of sales tax. The clause dealing with sales tax in Clause 3(b) further
provided that “appropriate sales tax, if any, found leviable in accordance with the
provisions of the relevant Sales Tax Act in force will be paid over and above the price
of goods accepted in this order”. The clause also provided that sales tax and excise
duty will be payable only on ex-factory price.
........
13. In the instant case, the obligation to pay the freight was clearly on the appellant as
there was no sale at all, unless the goods were delivered at the premises of the buyer
and in order to so deliver, the assessee necessarily had to incur freight charges. The
transfer of title to the goods as provided in Clause 10 read with Clause 6 of the
agreement was to be at the place of delivery in the premises of the buyer. Though the
contract mentioned the price of the electric meters as ex-factory price, the delivery
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74815763/ 12M/S.Oil And Natural Gas Commission vs The Tamil Nadu Sales Tax Appellate ... on 29 July, 2022
was not at the factory gate. The specification of what the price would be at the factory
gate, therefore, does not in the context of the term subject to which the sale was
agreed to be effected, render it the point or the location at which the sale can be said
to have been completed. Had the sale been completed at the factory gate, the
expenses incurred thereafter by way of freight charges would then be capable of being
regarded as expenditure which was in the nature of a post-sale expenditure and, if
paid by the seller, regarded as an amount paid by such seller on behalf of the buyer.
.......
18. When the transfer of the property or the goods is to be at the place of the buyer to
which the seller is under an obligation to transport the goods, the expenditure
incurred by the seller on freight in order to carry the goods from his place of
manufacture to the place at which he is required under the contract to deliver, would
thus become part of the amount for which the goods are sold by the seller to the
buyer and would fall within the scope of “turnover”.
(ii) In Dyer Meakin Breweries Ltd. v. State of Keralaÿ[(1970) 3 SCC 253] , Shah, C.J. (as His
Lordship then was), speaking for the Court observed that expenditure incurred for freight and
packing and delivery charges prior to the sale and for transporting the goods from the factories to
the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P. Nos.20503 to 20505 of 2007 warehouse of the company
is not admissible under Rule 9(f) of the Kerala General Sales Tax Rules, 1963.
......
27. The company claimed that the amount spent by it for freight and for “handling charges” of goods
from the factories to the warehouse at Ernakulam is liable to be excluded from the taxable turnover
and the taxing authorities and the High Court were in error in refusing to allow the deduction. This
Court while interpreting Rule 9(f) of the Kerala General Sales Tax Rules, 1963 observed that : (Dyer
Meakin case [(1970) 3 SCC 253] , SCC p. 254, para 3) “3. … It is not intended to exclude from the
taxable turnover any component of the price, expenditure, incurred by the dealer which he had to
incur before sale and to make the goods available to the intending customer at the place of sale.” It is
thus clear that the price being ex-works may have no bearing on the claim of deduction of freight
charges, if the delivery is not ex-works and the transfer of property in goods is postponed until the
delivery of goods at the buyers premises, which we would think on the facts of the cases, takes place
at the premises of MRL.
c. Relevance of transfer of property in determining the claim of deduction of freight charges :
A claim for deduction of freight charges would have to be determined not on the basis
of whether price is Ex-Works or F.O.R. Destination, instead for determining such
deduction, the enquiry ought to be the point where the property passes and who
bears the risk until the delivery. The freight charges until passing of property would
form part of the “sale price”/taxable turnover. The fact that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74815763/ 13M/S.Oil And Natural Gas Commission vs The Tamil Nadu Sales Tax Appellate ... on 29 July, 2022
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P. Nos.20503 to 20505 of 2007 risk is borne by
the seller until a particular point, is again prima facie indicative that the property
does not pass until and unless it is shown that risk was borne by the seller in the
capacity of an agent. In this regard, it may be useful to refer to the judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Hindustan Sugar Mills v. State of Rajasthan
[(1978) 4 SCC 271], the relevant passage of which may be extracted below:
"9. We may now take another example which is very much near to the one which we
have already discussed. The dealer may, instead of transporting the goods from his
factory or his place of business and selling them there, enter into a contract of sale
FOR destination railway station. Where such a contract is made, the seller
undertakes an obligation to put the goods on rail and arrange to have them carried to
the destination railway station at his expense. The delivery of the goods to the
purchaser in such a case is complete at the destination railway station and till then
the risk continues to remain with the dealer. The freight is payable by the dealer since
he has to arrange for the goods to be carried by rail to the destination railway station
at his expense and there is no obligation on the purchaser to pay the freight. The
purchaser is concerned only to pay the agreed price for the delivery of the goods at
the destination railway station. The agreed price being inclusive of the freight, it
would be a matter of indifference to the purchaser as to what is the amount of freight.
Even if there is any fluctuation in the amount of freight, since the making of the
contract, the purchaser would have no concern, because he is liable to pay only the
agreed price which includes the freight, whatever it be. The dealer may, in such a
case, pay the freight and charge the agreed price to the purchaser, or he may obtain a
railway receipt on the basis of “freight to pay” and request the purchaser to pay the
freight at the time of taking delivery of the goods from the railway at the destination
railway station and give the purchaser credit for the amount of the freight against the
agreed price. The later would merely be a convenient mode of paying the agreed
price. Since it is the obligation of the dealer to deliver the goods free on rail
destination railway station, the dealer is liable to pay the freight as between him and
the purchaser and the purchaser can very well refuse to accept the railway receipt
which is not “freight pre- paid” but “freight to pay”. But he may, ordinarily as a
reasonable businessman he would, accept such railway receipt and pay the amount of
freight on behalf of the dealer. When the purchasers pay the amount of freight in
such a case, it would be as part of the agreed price and not as freight vis-a-vis the
dealer. The amount of freight paid by the purchaser and shown in the bill as deducted
from the agreed price would, therefore, clearly form part of “sale price” and fall
within the first part of the definition.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P. Nos.20503 to 20505 of 2007 This would
plainly and indubitably be tin position where the contract of sale entered into by the
dealer is FOR destination railway station. But here it is necessary to bear in mind a
rather important distinction. There may be a case where the contract of sale may not
be FOR destination railway station, but the price alone may be so. Where such is the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74815763/ 14M/S.Oil And Natural Gas Commission vs The Tamil Nadu Sales Tax Appellate ... on 29 July, 2022
case, the contract does not have all the incidents of a FOR destination railway station
contract, but merely the price is stipulated on that basis. The terms of such a contract
may provide that the delivery shall be complete when the goods are put on rail and
thereafter it shall be at the risk of the purchaser. Such a stipulation would make the
railway agent of the purchaser for taking delivery of the goods.
(emphasis supplied)
(iii) Now, applying the above legal principles to the facts of the present case, it
appears that the petitioner was under an obligation to transport the crude oil to the
tank of MRL and the transfer of property in favour of MRL occurs only when the
crude oil is pumped into the storage tank/ point of the MRL. The fact that the
quantity, quality and the price is determined at that point after removal of Base
Sediment and Water (BS & W) would indicate that the property stood transferred
only then. Secondly, though not conclusive, one cannot turn a blind eye to the fact
that the crude oil is transported by way of pipelines belonging to the petitioner to the
oil storage point at Narimanam and thereafter through railway wagons or lorry to
Tondiarpet to the storing point of the petitioner and then through pipelines
belonging to the petitioners is delivered at MRL. The very fact that the pipelines,
when transportation of oil commences and culminates, belongs to the petitioner,
appears to be indicative of the fact that in the circumstances, it is impossible for MRL
to arrange for transport from the oil https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P.
Nos.20503 to 20505 of 2007 wells at Nannilam and Narimanam to its storage tank.
It may also be relevant to reiterate that the very fact that the goods are measured at
the Storage tank of MRL after removal of base sediment and water and until the said
exercise is carried out, the crude oil may not even have attained the deliverable state.
(iv) Further, there is no evidence let in whatsoever to show / demonstrate that
transfer of property in the goods viz., crude oil took place at Nannilam and
Narimanam and the transportation by the petitioner was only in its capacity as agent.
These are matters within the exclusive/ special knowledge of the assessee / petitioner
and in the absence of any pleading/ evidence being let in, the claim of deduction may
not be acceptable.
(v) However, in the present case, there is nothing to indicate that delivery is
Ex-Narimannam/Nannilam. To the contrary, the concurrent finding of fact by all the
three authorities viz., assessing officer, First Appellate Authority and the Tribunal is
that the property passes only at the storage point of the buyer viz., MRL. Thus, the
claim of deduction towards freight charges rejected by the Tribunal is on the basis of
the finding of facts based on evidence, which ought not to be disturbed unless shown
to be perverse or not based on evidence, which is not the case here.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P. Nos.20503 to 20505 of 2007 d. Relevance of Instructions by
Oil Coordination Committee:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74815763/ 15M/S.Oil And Natural Gas Commission vs The Tamil Nadu Sales Tax Appellate ... on 29 July, 2022
(i) The Oil Coordination Committee issued instructions from time to time and the
same has been relied upon to submit that the entire crude oil explored is to be sold to
MRL. The instructions were relied upon to state that the price is fixed by Oil
Coordination Committee. Importantly, there is no averment in the affidavit that the
Oil Coordination Committee also instructs as to the place where property is to pass.
In any event, a reading of the instruction would show that there is nothing in it,
which has bearing on the place or time, when the property passes nor on the aspect as
to whether freight charges are to be included in the sale price. The relevant portion of
the instructions is extracted below:
" I am directed to state that w.e.f. midnight of 15th / 16th September, 1992 the price
of Indigenous Crude both onshore and offshore has been revised to Rs.2720/MT. The
break-up of this price is as follows:-
Rs./MT
- Basic Price : Rs.1506
- Cess : Rs. 900
- Royalty : Rs. 314
2. Henceforth the applicable sales tax on the above price will be paid by the refining
companies to the producers of oil viz., ONGC and OIL and thereafter the refining
companies shall claim from the OCC Pool Account.
3. The increase in the price of indigenous crude oil on account of increase in the basic
rate of crude of Rs.538315/MT (i.e., Rs.1506-967.85) will be adjusted by the
refineries in the cope Account on the same basis as hither to.
4. The crude oil producers will arrange to take the inventory as at midnight of
15th/16th September, 1992 of the quantity https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis of crude
in storage tank/ pipeline fills representing the crude oil ready W.P. Nos.20503 to
20505 of 2007 for despatch but not actually sold to the refining companies. The
adventitious gas consequent to the revised price of crude oil that accrued to the crude
oil producers on such inventories will be computed and credited to the Pool Account
of OCC under intimation to the Ministry.
5. The price noted above will be on the base grevity of 340 API and the existing
gravity adjustments of 16 paise per barrel for every degree variation subject to a
ceiling of 450 SPI shall continue.
6. The revised price of crude oil as intimated above will be applicable from Central
Tank Farm of the producer and the pipeline/ road transportation charges will
continue to be recovered by the producers in accordance with the transportation
rates advised by the Ministry/ OCC under the current practice."

(ii) It must be clarified that if the instructions of Oil Coordination Committee are statutory in
nature, it may override the clauses in the contract contrary to it. In this regard, it may be relevant to
refer to the decision in the case of Hindustan Sugars Mills [(1978) 4 SCC 271], wherein while dealing
with a statutory control order it was held as under:
“The Control Order is paramount: it has overriding effect and if it stipulates that the
freight shall be payable by the producer, such stipulation must prevail,
notwithstanding any term or condition of the contract to the contrary. The conclusion
is, therefore, inevitable that the amount of freight forms part of the “sale price”
within the meaning of the first part of the definition.”
(iii) However, it is not clear that the instructions of the Oil Co-
ordination Committee has any statutory force. Assuming that it does, the petitioner may well be
justified in stating that freight charges must be deducted from the taxable turnover provided they
are able to demonstrate that in terms of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P. Nos.20503 to 20505
of 2007 the instructions issued by the Oil Co-ordination Committee, the freight charges were not
included in the sale price or that the property would pass at the station / point of despatch. A
reading of the instructions issued by the Oil Co-ordination Committee, apart from the fact that there
is no indication that it has any statutory force, would also reveal that the producers are entitled to
recover the transportation rates, as evident from a reading of Clause 6 of the communication dated
04.11.1992. Though Clause 1 speaks about the price of goods both onshore and offshore, the price is
only “Basic Price”, which is again not indicative of whether the freight element is included or
otherwise. Normally, the freight charges are not included in the basic price. It may also be relevant
to note that assuming these instructions are executive/ administrative in nature, the same may
override the terms of contract, but cannot override the statutory provisions, which mandate that
freight would form part of the sale price/ taxable turnover if the same is pre-sale expenditure, but
eligible for deduction in case it is a post- sale expenditure. The following judgments may have
relevance in appreciating the limitation of executive instructions in fiscal matters:-
i) Harivansh Lal Mehra v. State of Maharashtra, [(1971) 2 SCC 54]:
6. .............No tax or duty can be levied or collected except by authority of law. Hence
no customs duty was leviable on the basis of any administrative instruction. Every
levy of customs duty or any other tax must be sanctioned by law. It is surprising that
both the trial court as well as the High Court were of the opinion that certain customs
duties were leviable because of some administrative instructions........”
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis W.P. Nos.20503 to 20505 of 2007
ii) Narinder Chand Hem Raj v. Lt. Governor & Administrator, H.P., [(1971) 2 SCC
747]:
“.....Article 265 of the Constitution lays down that no tax can be levied and collected
except by authority of law. Hence the levy of a tax can only be done by the authority
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74815763/ 17M/S.Oil And Natural Gas Commission vs The Tamil Nadu Sales Tax Appellate ... on 29 July, 2022
of law and not by any executive order.... "
(iv) Thus, we find that there is nothing expressed in the Oil Co-
ordination Committee Instructions, which indicate that the transportation is made by the producers
as an agent after completion of sale necessary to claim the deduction. To the contrary, the findings
of fact by all the authorities below and the nature of the commodity and the mode of transport
would lead one to the conclusion that the claim of deduction of the freight element by the petitioner
is liable to be rejected.
12. For all the reasons stated above, we are of the considered view that the freight charges form part
of the price of the goods and thus, not entitled to deduction, in the absence of the petitioner showing
that the property stood transferred in terms of the contract or Oil Co-ordination Committee
instructions at the point of despatch i.e., Narimannam. Thus, the writ petitions fail and are
accordingly, dismissed. No costs.
