VALMIKI J.MEHTA, J
1. An issue of far reaching importance is called for decision in the present case. The issue is that can
contractual clauses dis-entitle a person from claiming damages which a person is otherwise entitled
to under law. Putting it differently, can a person who is guilty of breach of contract and is
consequentially liable in law to pay damages under Section 73 of the Contract Act or other charges
under Section 55 of the Contract Act 1872, can prevent the CS(OS)614A/2002 Page 1 aggrieved party
from claiming the same by contractually so providing i.e. can the Arbitrator be prevented from
awarding the damages/losses simply because clauses in the contract prohibits award of
damages/losses.
2. The relevant contractual clauses in this case are Clauses 11A to 11C and which clauses read as
under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198200255/ 1M/S. Simplex Concrete Piles ... vs Union Of India on 23 February, 2010
"11. Time, delay and extension.--(A) Time is of the essence of the contract and is
specified in the contract documents or in each individual works order.
As soon as possible, after contract is let or any substantial work order is placed and
before work under it is begun, the GE and the contractor shall agree upon the time
and progress chart. The chart shall be prepared in direct relation to the time stated in
the contract documents or the works order for completion of the individual items
thereof and/or the contract or works order as a whole. It shall include the forecast of
the dates for commencement and completion of the various trades, processes or
sections of the work, and shall be amended as may be required by agreement between
the GE and the contractor within the limitation of time imposed in the contract
documents or works order. If the work be delayed:
(i) by force majeure, or
(ii) by reason of abnormally bad weather, or
(iii) by reason of serious loss or damage by fire, or
(iv) by reason of civil commotion, local combination of workmen, strike or lockout,
affecting any of the tradesmen employed on the work, or
(v) by reason of delay on part of nominated sub-contractors, or nominated suppliers
which the contractor has, in the opinion of GE, taken all practicable steps to avoid, or
reduce, or
(vi) by reason of delay on the part of contractors or tradesmen engaged by the
Government in executing work not forming part of the contract, or * * *
(viii) by reason of any other cause, which in the absolute discretion of the accepting
officer is beyond the contractor(cid:128)s control; then in any such case the officer
hereinafter mentioned may make fair and reasonable extension in the completion
dates of individual items or groups of items of works for which separate periods of
completion are mentioned in the contract documents or works order, as applicable.
* * *
CS(OS)614A/2002 Page 2
(B) If the works be delayed:
(a) by reason of non-availability of government stores in Schedule B or
(b) by reason of non-availability or breakdown of government tools and plant listed
in Schedule C;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198200255/ 2M/S. Simplex Concrete Piles ... vs Union Of India on 23 February, 2010
then, in any such event, notwithstanding the provisions hereinbefore contained, the
accepting officer may in his discretion, grant such extension of time as may appear
reasonable to him and the same shall be communicated to the contractor by the GE
in writing. The decision so communicated shall be final and binding and the
contractor shall be bound to complete the works within such extended time. (C) No
claim in respect of compensation or otherwise, howsoever arising, as a result of
extensions granted under Conditions (A) and (B) above shall be admitted."
On the basis of the aforesaid clauses, it is contended that even if there is a breach of contract by the
objector/Union of India in causing delays by its own faults, even then, damages cannot be claimed
by a contractor and such damages cannot be awarded by the Arbitrator.
3. The issue involved in the present case has become further complex because of two judgments of
the Supreme Court dealing with very much these Clauses 11A to 11C. Whereas in the case of
Ramnath International Construction (P) Ltd. Vs. Union of India (2007)2SCC 453, the Supreme
Court while interpreting these clauses has held that even if the employer/Union of India is at fault,
yet, Clauses 11A to 11C bar the entitlement of the contractor to damages, on the other hand, a recent
judgment of the Supreme Court reported as Asian Techs Limited Vs. Union of India and others
(2009)10SCC 354 holds that the clauses in question, namely, 11A to 11C, prevents only the
department from granting damages, but it does not prevent the Arbitrator from awarding
CS(OS)614A/2002 Page 3 damages which are otherwise payable by the employer on account of its
breach of contract.
4. By the impugned Award, the Arbitrator has very logically, thoroughly, exhaustively and with
clarity interpreted the relevant Clauses 11A to 11C and held that Clause 11A ought not to be
interpreted to deny damages to a contractor when the fault is of the employer. Since the Award
effectively discusses and gives the rationale for interpretation of Clauses 11A to 11C to entitle the
contractor to damages, I reproduce below few of the relevant paragraphs of the Award and which
read as under:
"36. The above agreement between the parties carries an exception clause and that is
concerning the dispute for which final and binding decision is vested in an authority
or an official. The dispute in the reference is for claim for losses or damages on
account of prolongation of contract period. No final and binding decision as to
whether claim for losses or damages on account of prolongation of contract period
could be made or not is catered for in the contract. Condition 11(A) and 11(B) of
IAFW-2249 provide for grant of extension to contract period. Use of words „final and
binding decision(cid:128) in these two conditions relates to quantum or extent of extension
granted implying thereby that the decision of authorities stated therein is final and
binding on the length of extension granted. Contractor cannot thus dispute if his
request for extension of time is not approved upto the date requested by him. This is
not the case in the present reference as full extension, upto the certified date of
completion of contract, had been granted. The use of term „final and binding(cid:128) in
these conditions 11(A) and (B) can thus have no other implication. Now, I turn to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198200255/ 3M/S. Simplex Concrete Piles ... vs Union Of India on 23 February, 2010
provisions contained in Condition 11(c) of IAFW-2249. It states that no claim in
respect of compensation or otherwise, however arising as a result of extension
granted under conditions 11(A) and (B) shall be admitted. UOI, in their submissions
and arguments, heavily relied on these provisions and argued that all reasons for
extensions of time were on account of failure on the part of Contractor in timely
fulfilment of his contractual obligations.
Though condition 11(c) does not contain for any final and finding binding decision by any authority
or official, as envisaged in the arbitration agreement between the parties, yet it carries the force of
stopping the Contractor for raising any claim of compensation. There is, however, an over-riding
provision i.e. the reason necessitating the grant of extension have to fall within those listed in
Condition 11(A) and (B). It is quite logical to have such a provision in the contract as the Contractor
accepts the CS(OS)614A/2002 Page 4 liability, including financial liability, if the contract gets
delayed for the reasons given in condition 11(A) and (B). If, on the other hand, it becomes necessary
to grant extension to contract period for reasons other than those listed in Condition 11(A) and (B),
the liability and consequences thereof are not accepted by the Contractor. This has been made very
specific and made known to Contractor before quoting. This agreed provision of the contract needs
to be respected. The line of demarcation is therefore explicitly drawn between the parties in
accepting responsibilities for liabilities arising out of delays caused in execution of the Contract.
Extension to contract period could be granted under Condition 7 and 9 of IAFW-2249. Contractor
could be justified extension of time if for any reason he is prevented from performance of his
obligations. Sections 51 to 55 of Indian Contract Act would refer. In any case, the two parties to a
contract, could mutually agree to a new completion date but as per IAFW-2249, Contractor is
stopped from raising claim for compensation only and only if reasons for grant of extension to
contract period fall within those listed in conditions 11(A) and (B) and not for any other reason.
Provisions of condition 11 (c) cannot therefore be applied across the board and details would need to
be examined after affording due respect to this condition 11(c).
39. The discussions in Para 36 above make it necessary to go through the reasons listed in the said
conditions 11(A) and (B). Condition 11(A) has seven reasons with reasons (i) to (vi) referring to
force-majeure, abnormally bad weather, fire, civil commotion, strike or lockout, delays by
nominated suppliers or sub contractors despite best efforts of contractor or by Government
Contractor/tradesmen in executing works not forming part of contract. All these six reasons relate
to occurrences or events on which Contractor could have had no control whatsoever. Reason (vii)
goes further to add "by reason or any other cause, which in the absolute discretion of the Accepting
Officer is beyond the control of Contractor". The reason (vii) is thus an extension of reasons (i) to
(vi) without specific mention of cause. UOI submitted that this reason covered all aspects which the
Accepting Officer considered as beyond Contractor(cid:128)s control. According to them, this would also
include the reasons of delay even if caused at the hands of Department as these were also beyond the
control of Contractor. On this specific issue, Contractor relied on the rule of „ejusdem generis" and
even referred to Supreme Court Judgement AIR 1979 SC 65. I have examined this aspect and opine
that reason (vii) cannot be considered in isolation of other reasons (i) to (vi). It obviously intends
any reason or any specific causes, other than those listed in (i) to (vi), which are beyond
contractor(cid:128)s control that is the causes on which Contractor can have no control. It cannot be made
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198200255/ 4M/S. Simplex Concrete Piles ... vs Union Of India on 23 February, 2010
to encompass the reason or causes which are within Government(cid:128)s or Department(cid:128)s control and
then they cause the delays. In the garb of the wording of reason (vii), it is not correct to bring in such
reasons or delays caused at the hands of Department. Such a liability cannot, contractually, be
passed on to the Contractor for he cannot be expected to provide for it in his quotation. If the
arguments of UOI were to be accepted then it would imply that consequences of all or any delays,
consciously or otherwise, caused by Department would be borne by Contractor. I cannot therefore
subscribe to CS(OS)614A/2002 Page 5 the views of UOI and hold that reason 11 A(vii) cannot be
made to include, in its ambit, the delays caused at the hands of the Department.
40. In view of the above discussions, Contractor is stopped from raising any claim for compensation
or otherwise, howsoever arising, only for reasons falling under condition 11(A) and (B) of
IAFW-2249 with the implication of reason (vii) as concluded by me in the preceding paragraph. For
reasons, other than these, which lead to grant of extension to contract period, condition 11(c) cannot
come into action. This conclusion is based on logical, just and fair interpretation of condition 11(c)."
5. I would have ordinarily accepted this thorough reasoning as given in the Award, however, the
Supreme Court has in fact held just the opposite in the judgment of Ramnath International's case
(supra), in paragraph 12 thereof, and which reads as under:
12. Clause (C) provides that where extensions have been granted by reason of the
delays enumerated in clause (A) which were beyond the control of the contractor, or
on account of the delays on the part of the employer specified in clause (B), the
contractor is not entitled to make any claim either for compensation or otherwise,
arising in whatsoever manner, as a result of such extensions. After enumerating
certain delays, sub-clause (viii) of clause (A) specifically mentions delay on account of
any other cause beyond the control of the contractor. The causes for delays specified
in clause (A), thus, encompass all delays over which the contractor has no control.
This will necessarily include any delays attributable to the employer or any delay for
which both the employer and the contractor are responsible. The contract thus
provides that if there is any delay, attributable either to the contractor or the
employer or to both, and the contractor seeks and obtains extension of time for
execution on that account, he will not be entitled to claim compensation of any
nature, on the ground of such delay, in addition to the extension of time obtained by
him. Therefore, the claims for compensation as a consequence of delays, that is Claim
24 of the Hangar Contract and Claims 13 to 16 of the Road Contract are barred by
clause 11(C).
(Underlining is mine) As already stated above, the Supreme Court in the recent judgment of Asian
Techs Limited's case (supra) has held to the contrary while interpreting the same clauses.

6. What should a High Court do when faced with two judgments of the Supreme Court which
apparently cannot be reconciled with respect to its ratios? The Full Bench of the Patna High Court in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198200255/ 5M/S. Simplex Concrete Piles ... vs Union Of India on 23 February, 2010
the judgment reported as Amar Singh Yadav Vs. Shanti Devi and Ors. AIR 1987 Pat 191 has held that
when there are two differing judgments of the Supreme Court, then, the High Court should follow
that judgment which lays down the correct law. The relevant paras of the judgment are as under:
"15. In fairness to the learned Counsel for the respondents, it must be said that the
aforesaid observation indicates that there is a direct conflict on this point herein with
the ratio in the Himalaya Tiles and Marble (Private) Limited, ( AIR 1980 SC 1118)
(supra). However, both the judgments have been rendered by a Bench consisting of
two Hon'ble Judges and cannot possibly be reconciled. This situation at once brings
to the fore the somewhat intricate question posed at the outset, which has come to be
of not infrequent occurrence, namely, when there is a direct conflict between two
decisions of the Supreme Court, rendered by co-equal Benches which of them should
be followed by the High Courts and the Courts below.
16. Now the contention strongly urged on behalf of the respondents that the earlier
judgment of a co-ordinate Bench is to be mechanically followed and must have
preeminence, irrespective of any other consideration, because the latter one has
missed notice thereof, does not commend itself to me. When judgments of the
superior Courts are of co-equal Benches, and, therefore, a matching authority, then
their weight inevitably must be considered by the rational and the logic thereof and
not by the mere fortuitous circumstance of the timeand date on which they were
rendered. Equally, the fact that the subsequent judgment failed to take notice of the
earlier one or any presumption that a deviation therefrom could not be intended,
cannot possibly be conclusive. Vital issues, pertaining to the vital questions of the
certainty and uniformity of the law, cannot be scuttled by such legal sophistry. It is
manifest that when two directly conflicting judgments of the superior Court and of
equal authority exist, then both of them cannot be binding on the Courts below. A
choice, however difficult it may be, has to be made in such a situation and the date
cannot be the guide. However, on principle, it appears to me, that the High Court
must in this context follow the judgment, which would appear to lay down the law
more elaborately and accurately. The mere incidence of time, whether the judgments
of co-equal Benches of the superior Court are earlier or later, and whether the later
one missed consideration of the earlier, are matters which appear to me as hardly
relevant, and, in any case, not conclusive.
CS(OS)614A/2002 Page 7
17. The view I am inclined to take has the support of the high authority of Jessel M. R.
in Hampton v. Holman (1877) 5 Ch D 183. Therein also the learned Master of the
Rolls was faced with the difficult task of choosing between the two decisions of equal
authority, which were directly in conflict with each other. He observed as follows : --
"Now I take it that both the cases to which I have referred are not to be reconciled
with Hayes v. Hayes (1828) 38 ER 822 at all events, they differ from it so far as to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198200255/ 6M/S. Simplex Concrete Piles ... vs Union Of India on 23 February, 2010
leave me at liberty now to say that Hayes v. Hayes is not sound law; indeed it appears
that Sir John Leach himself was dissatisfied with his decision."
Again in Miles v. Jarvis (1883) 24 Ch D 633, Kay, J., was similarly faced with two
judgments of equal weight which were in conflict. He observed as follows :--
".......... The question is which of these two decisions 1 should follow, and, it seems to
me that 1 ought to follow that of the Master of the Rolls as being the better in point of
law."
Reference in this context may in particular be made to the celebrated case of Young v.
Bristol Aeroplane Co. Ltd. (1944) KB 718. Therein, in a similar context of the Court of
appeal being bound by its previous decisions, it was held that it was not only entitled
but indeed duty bound to decide which of the two conflicting decisions of its own will
it follow in case of a clear divergence of the opinion in the earlier precedents.
18. I am not unaware that in Govindnaik G. Kalaghatigi v. West Patent Press
Company Limited AIR 1980 Kan 92, a narrowly divided Full Bench has taken the
view, by majority of three : two, that in such a situation, the later of the two decisions
should be followed. A perusal of the judgment would, however, show that, in fact,
there were two questions firmly posed before the Full Bench -- firstly that where
there was a conflict of two decisions of the Supreme Court of unequal Benches, which
one is to be followed and, secondly, when these decisions are of co-equal Benches,
then which decision is to be followed. It seems somewhat patent that the majority
view adverted to the first of the two questions alone, and, there does not appear to be
any discussion whatsoever on the second question. The minority decision, however,
while agreeing with the majority view on the first question, adverted to the second
question and considered the matter in detail, concluding as follows : --
".....It seems to us, therefore, the High Court would be well advised to consider which
of two conflicting decisions it will follow in the interest of the administration of
justice and it ought to follow that which is better in point of law than in point of
time."
With great respect, I am inclined to wholly agree with the aforesaid view of the
minority and it bears repetition that the majority view does not seem to have even
adverted to this question in essence.
CS(OS)614A/2002 Page 8
20. I am not unmindful of the legal aphorism that a living authority is not to be
quoted. Yet, because of the eminence, Mr. Seervai's authoritative Constitutional Law
of India already achieved, it is necessary to notice his opinion in this context, in the
latest edition of that work at page 2244 (Third Edn.).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198200255/ 7M/S. Simplex Concrete Piles ... vs Union Of India on 23 February, 2010
"But judgments of the Supreme Court, which cannot stand together, present a serious
problem to the High Courts and to the subordinate Courts. It is submitted that in
such situations, the correct thing is to follow that judgment which appears to the
Court to state the law accurately, or more accurately than the other conflicting
judgment."
23. I am more than amply conscious of the difficulties of making a choice between
decisions of the superior court when they are in direct conflict with each other. But,
such a duty can neither be skirted nor evaded. It was rightly and forcefully pointed
out by Lord Denning in Seaford Court Estates Ltd. v. Asher (1949) 2 All ER 155 that
when a Judge comes up against such a truck, he is not to fold his hands and it is his
duty to iron out the creases. Therefore, when such a divergence arises and the
litigant's fortune depends thereon, the issue has to be frontally adjudicated upon.
Obviously, in such a situation, it is not the province of the High Court or the
subordinate court to comment on the judgment of the Supreme Court, which are
patently entitled to respect. Its plain duty, in the interest of justice, is to respectfully
follow that which appears to it to state the law accurately or, in any case more
accurately than the other conflicting judgment. The view I am inclined to take is not
only fortified, but in a way derived from the Full Bench judgment in Indo Swiss Time
Limited v. Umrao AIR 1891 P&H 213. It, perhaps, deserves highlighting that though
on another point the learned Judges of the Full Bench differed but on this particular
momentous issue there was an absolute unanimity. The subsequent Full Bench
decision in Kulbhushan Kumar and Co. v. State of Punjab AIR 1984 P & Har 55 is also
in a way relevant and instructive.
24. To conclude on this aspect, it is held that where there is a direct conflict betwixt
two decisions of the Supreme Court rendered by co-equal Benches, the High Court
must follow that judgment which appears to it to state the law more elaborately and
accurately. The answer to question (1) posed at the outset is rendered in these terms."
7. Various other High Courts of the country have also held that when there are conflicting judgments
of Supreme Court of co-equal Benches, then, the High Court ought to follow the judgment which
lays down the law more correctly. The aforesaid judgment in the case of Amar Singh Yadav (supra)
relied upon the judgement of Indo Swiss Time Limited vs. Umrao and Ors AIR CS(OS)614A/2002
Page 9 1981 P &H 213 (FB) and the ratio of which judgment was followed by the Bombay High Court
in the judgment reported as The Special Land Acquisition Officer (I), Bombay and Anr. Vs. The
Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay AIR 1988 Bom 9. The Full Bench High Court of
Allahabad in the judgment reported as Ganga Saran Vs. Civil Judge, Hapur, Ghaziabad and others
AIR 1991 All 114 has held as under:
"7. One line of decision is that if there is a conflict in two Supreme Court decisions,
the decision which is later in point of time would be binding on the High Courts. The
second line of decisions is that in case there is a conflict between the judgments of
Supreme Court consisting of equal authorities, incidence of time is not a relevant
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198200255/ 8M/S. Simplex Concrete Piles ... vs Union Of India on 23 February, 2010
factor and the High Court must follow the judgment which appears it to lay down
elaborately and accurately.
8. Similar situation arose before a Full Bench of Punjab and Haryana High Court in
the case of M/s Indo Swiss Time Limited, Dundahera Vs. Umrao, AIR 1981 Punj &
Har 213. What the Full Bench in the said case held is extracted below (at pp. 219-220
of AIR):
"Now the contention that the latest judgment of a co-ordinate Bench is to be
mechanically followed and must have pre-eminence irrespective of any other
consideration does not commend itself to me. When judgments of the superior Court
are of co-equal Benches and therefore, of matching authority then their weight
inevitably must be considered by the rationale and the logic thereof and not by the
mere fortuitous circumstances of the time and date on which they were rendered. It is
manifest that when two directly conflicting judgments of the superior Court and of
equal authority are extant then both of them cannot be binding on the courts below.
Inevitably a choice, though a difficult one, has to be made in such a situation. On
principle it appears to me that the High Court must follow the judgment which
appears to it to lay down the law more elaborately and accurately. The mere incidence
of time whether the judgments of coequal Benches of the Superior Court are earlier
later is a consideration which appears to me as hardly relevant".
This decision was followed by the Bombay High Court in the case of Special Land Acquisition Officer
Vs. Municipal Corporation, AIR 1988 Bombay 9. The majority of Judges in the Full Bench held that
if there was a conflict between the two decisions of equal benches which cannot possibly
CS(OS)614A/2002 Page 10 reconcile, the courts must follow the judgment which appear to them to
state the law accurately and elaborately. We are in respectful agreement with the view expressed by
the Full Bench of Punjab & Haryana High Court in the case of M/s Indo Swiss Time Limited Vs.
Umrao (AIR 1981 Punj & Har
213) (Supra) especially when the Supreme Court while deciding Qamaruddin(cid:128)s case (1990 All WC
308) (Supra) did not notice the U.P. amendment to S.115, C.P.C. and earlier decision of the Supreme
Court. In the light of the view expressed in this case it is to be examined as to which of the case
decided by the Supreme Court lays down the law accurately. As noticed earlier the U.P. Amendment
Act No.XXXXI of 1978 amended S.115 of Code of Civil Procedure. By virtue of this amendment,
revision u/S.115, S.P.C. did not lie to the High Court against the appellate or revisional order passed
by the District Court where the valuation of the suit is less than Rs.20,000/-. This amendment came
up for consideration in M/s Jupiter Chit Fund (Pvt) Ltd. Vs. Dwarka Diesh, (AIR 1979 All 218) (FB)
(Supra) and it was held that S.115, C.P.C. as amended by U.P. Amendment Act assigns mutually
exclusive jurisdiction to the High Court and district Court. This full bench decision was affirmed by
Supreme Court in its two decisions namely in the cases of Vishesh Kumar V. Shanti Prasad, (AIR
1980 SC 892) and Vishnu Awatar Vs. Shiv Autar (AIR 1980 SC 1575) (supra). A perusal of the
judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Qamaruddin(cid:128)s case (1990 All WC 309) (Supra)
indicates that it was not brought to the notice of the bench deciding the case that it was a case from
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198200255/ 9M/S. Simplex Concrete Piles ... vs Union Of India on 23 February, 2010
U.P. and that S.115, C.P.C. amended by U.P. Amendment Act No.XXXI of 1978 governed the matter.
The matter was disposed of as if S.115, C.P.C. as originally enacted applied."
8. All the above judgments have been considered by a Division Bench of this Court in the judgment
reported as Smt. Gopa Manish Vora Vs. Union of India MANU/DE/0841/2009 and the relevant
paras of which read as under:
"19. We are, therefore, faced with a situation where one line of decisions of the
Supreme Court indicates that the five circumstances mentioned in Alka Gadia (supra)
are exhaustive and another line of decisions of the Supreme Court of benches of equal
strength indicates that the said circumstances are illustrative and not exhaustive.
This raises the question as to what the High Court is to do in a situation where there
is a conflict between decisions of the Supreme Court rendered by Benches of equal
strength. In Ganga Saran v. Civil Judge, Hapur, Ghaziabad and Ors.
MANU/UP/0025/1991 : AIR1991All114 , a Full Bench of CS(OS)614A/2002 Page 11
the High Court of Allahabad considered this very question. The Full Bench observed
as under:
7. One line of decision is that if there is a conflict in two Supreme Court decisions, the
decision which is later in point of time would be binding on the High Courts. The
second line of decisions is that in case there is a conflict between the judgments of
Supreme Court consisting of equal authorities, incidence of time is not a relevant
factor and the High Court must follow the judgment which appears it to lay down law
elaborately and accurately.
20. The Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court referred to a Full Bench decision of
the Punjab and Haryana High Court in the case of Indo Swiss Time Limited,
Dundahera v. Umrao and Ors. MANU/PH/0164/1981, wherein it was observed as
under:
Now the contention that the latest judgment of a co- ordinate Bench is to be
mechanically followed and must have pre-eminence irrespective of any other
consideration does not commend itself to me. When judgments of the superior Court
are of co-equal Benches and therefore, of matching authority then their weight
inevitably must be considered by the rationale and the logic thereof and not by the
mere fortuitous circumstances of the time and date on which they were rendered. It is
manifest that when two directly conflicting judgments of the superior Court and of
equal authority are extant then both of them cannot be binding on the courts below.
Inevitably a choice, though a difficult one, has to be made in such a situation. On
principle it appears to me that the High Court must follow the judgment which
appears to it to lay down the law more elaborately and accurately. The mere incidence
of time whether the judgments of coequal Benches of the Superior Court are earlier
later is a consideration which appears to me as hardly relevant.

21. The Allahabad High Court in Ganga Saran (supra) agreed with the view taken by
the Full Bench of Punjab & Haryana High Court in Indo Swiss Time Limited (supra)
that when there is a conflict between two decisions of equal Benches, which cannot be
reconciled, the courts must follow the judgment which appears to them to state the
law accurately and elaborately.
22. A Division Bench of this Court in Virender Kumar @ Bittoo v. State
MANU/DE/0583/1995 : 59(1995)DLT341 also considered the question of conflict of
judgments of different Benches of the Supreme Court of co-equal strength. The
Division Bench noted with approval the decision of the Full Bench of the Allahabad
High Court in the case of Ganga Saran (supra) as having been laid down that if there
is a conflict between two decisions of equal Benches of the Supreme Court, which
cannot possibly be reconciled, the courts must follow the judgment which appears to
them to state the law accurately and elaborately and particularly so when the later
decision of the Supreme Court did not notice the earlier decision."

9. I would have ordinarily decided this case on a totally different issue, viz of the
contractual clauses being void under Section 23 of the Contract Act, and which aspect
I will dilate upon a little later, however, Mr. V.P.
Chaudhary, Senior Advocate, appearing for the petitioner, has argued that this Court must decide as
to which judgment applies i.e. whether of Ramnath International or Asian Techs and for this
purpose has invited my attention to the decision of the Supreme Court reported as M/s. Indian
Petrochemicals Corp. Ltd. Vs. Shramik Seva AIR 2001SC 3510 and para 8 thereof in which the
Supreme Court mandates the High Court to take a view on merits on the issue, although there is
apparently conflicting views as per the judgment of the Supreme Court. This para 8 reads as under:
"8. We have perused the impugned order of the High Court. We are unable to
appreciate the approach of the High Court. Even when it was faced with diametrically
apposite interpretation of the judgment of this Court, it was expected of the High
Court to decide the case (writ petition) on merit according to its own interpretation of
the said judgment. Instead the High Court after referring to rival contentions of the
parties, in para 3, observed thus:
"In our view, the right course for the petitioner will be to approach the Apex Court
and to seek a clarification of the said order. Mr. Singhvi is agreeable to take necessary
steps."
And having directed the appellants herein to take back the employees for a period of
four months or until order is passed by this Court whichever is earlier, disposed of
the writ petition."

10. In deciding this issue of the disentitlement to damages to the contractor (because of Ramnath
International's case) or the entitlement to damages (on account of Asian Techs Limited's case),
however, I would prefer to decide this case and base this judgment wholly, independently on my
view that clauses CS(OS)614A/2002 Page 13 which bar and disentitle a contractor to claim its just
claims/damages/monetary entitlement, and which a contractor is entitled to by virtue of provisions
of Sections 73 and 55 of the Contract Act, are void by virtue of Section 23 of the Contract Act, 1872. I
am also taking up this aspect of Section 23 first because the present discussion will help in deciding
whether correct law is laid down in Ramnath International's case or in Asian Techs Limited's case. It
is therefore necessary, at this stage, to reproduce Section 23 of the Contract Act. The same reads as
under:
"23. What considerations and objects are lawful, and what not.--The consideration or
object of an agreement is lawful, unless-- it is forbidden by law 1; or is of such a
nature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law; or is fraudulent;
or involves or implies injury to the person or property of another; or the Court
regards it as immoral, or opposed to public policy.
In each of these cases, the consideration or object of an agreement is said to be
unlawful. Every agreement of which the object or consideration is unlawful, is void."
A reading of the aforesaid provision of Section 23 shows that where the consideration
or object of an agreement is unlawful, the said agreement is void. The consideration
or object of an agreement is unlawful if it is forbidden by law or it is of such a nature
that if permitted it defeats the provisions of law or the same involves injury to the
person or property of another or the Court regards it as immoral or opposed to public
policy. Two parts of this Section are relevant for determining the issue in the present
case.
The first part being that a clause in an agreement is unlawful and void when the CS(OS)614A/2002
Page 14 same is opposed to public policy. The second part is that such a contractual clause is void if
allowing operation of such clause will defeat the provisions of law.
11. The expression "public policy" has been a subject matter of various decisions of the Supreme
Court. It has been held that the expression "public policy" has to be interpreted in the context of the
statute in which such expression appears. The expression "public policy" as per the requirement and
the context of the statute in which the expression is found, has been accordingly interpreted by the
Supreme Court. What is therefore the meaning which should be attributed to this expression as
found in Section 23 is the question. Instead of referring to various judgments, I would seek to refer
to the observations and the ratio of the Supreme Court in one of its recent judgments reported as
Indian Financial Association of Seventh Day Adventists Vs. M.A. Unneerikutty and Another
(2006)6SCC 351 on the meaning of this expression in Section 23. I refer to this judgment because in
a few paragraphs the Supreme Court has encapsulated the law with regard to the expression „public
policy(cid:128) and in the process has also referred to its earlier decisions on the point as also the relevant
commentaries of certain authors. Paras 16 to 19 of the said judgment lays down the ratio with regard
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198200255/ 12M/S. Simplex Concrete Piles ... vs Union Of India on 23 February, 2010
to the meaning of the expression "public policy", and which I with all humility adopt, for the
purpose of the decision in the present case. These paragraphs 16 to 19 read as under:
CS(OS)614A/2002 Page 15
16. Section 23 of the Contract Act lays down that the object of an agreement becomes unlawful if it
was of such a nature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law.
17. The term "public policy" has an entirely different and more extensive meaning from the policy of
the law. Winfield defined it as a principle of judicial legislation or interpretation founded on the
current needs of the community. It does not remain static in any given community and varies from
generation to generation. Judges, as trusted interpreters of the law, have to interpret it. While doing
so, precedents will also guide them to a substantial extent.
18. The following passage from Maxwell, Interpretation of Statutes, may also be quoted to advantage
here:
"Everyone has a right to waive and to agree to waive the advantage of a law or rule made solely for
the benefit and protection of the individual in his private capacity which may be dispensed with
without infringing any public right or public policy. Where there is no express prohibition against
contracting out of it, it is necessary to consider whether the Act is one which is intended to deal with
private rights only or whether it is an Act which is intended as a matter of public policy...."
19. The doctrine of public policy may be summarised thus11: "Public policy or the policy of the law is
an illusive concept; it has been described as „untrustworthy guide(cid:128), „variable quality(cid:128), „uncertain
one(cid:128), „unruly horse(cid:128), etc.; the primary duty of a court of law is to enforce a promise which the
parties have made and to uphold the sanctity of contracts which form the basis of society, but in
certain cases, the court may relieve them of their duty on a rule founded on what is called the public
policy; ... but the doctrine is extended not only to harmful cases but also to harmful tendencies; this
doctrine of public policy is only a branch of common law, and just like any other branch of common
law, it is governed by precedents; the principles have been crystallised under different heads and
though it is permissible for the courts to expound and apply them to different situations, it should
only be invoked in clear and incontestable cases of harm to the public."
(Underlining supplied)
12. The following principles can be culled out from the aforesaid paragraphs:
(i) Public policy is a changing concept, it is not static but dynamic; it changes from time to time and
the Courts have been empowered while interpreting this doctrine to resort to, judicial legislation
euphemistically called „interpretation(cid:128), to further the public interest, equity, good conscience and
justice.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198200255/ 13M/S. Simplex Concrete Piles ... vs Union Of India on 23 February, 2010
(ii) A law which is made for individual benefit can be waived by an individual/private person,
however, when such law includes a public interest/public policy element, such rights arising from
the law cannot be waived because the same becomes a matter of public policy/public interest.
13. The Supreme Court in its judgment reported as M.G. Brothers Lorry Service Vs. M/s. Prasad
Textiles 1983(3)SCC 61 has held that a contractual clause which is in the teeth of a provision which
furthers the intendment of a statute, has to give way and such a clause becomes void and inoperative
by virtue of Section 23 of the Contract Act. The Supreme Court in M.G. Brother's case was dealing
with a contractual provision which sought to set at naught Section 10 of the Carriers Act 1865. The
Supreme Court in the said judgment has held the following :
"Condition 15 of the Way Bill is void in view of Section 23 of the Contract Act because
its object was to defeat the provisons of Section 10 of the Carriers Act.
If under a particular bargain the rights of the parties were extinguished that would
not hit the provisions of Section 28 of Contract Act and as such would not be violative
of Section 23 of the said Act. But if rights are not extinguished but only the remedies
are barred different consideration would apply.
"The Carriers Act was passed, not only to limit the liability of the carriers, but also to declare the
liability of the carriers. Therefore, any contract or bargain which seeks to defeat the liability of the
carriers as enacted by law would defeat the provisions of that Act. Under Condition 14 there was
neither any extinguishment or liability nor contracting out of liability but only a special period of
limitation of notice was provided other than Section 10 of the Carriers Act. If Condition 15 be
permitted then it will defeat the provisions of Section 10 of the Carriers Act. Even in a case where
the plaintiff was unaware of the arrival of the goods at the destination or was unaware of a loss or
damage, the plaintiff would not have any right to institute a suit if no claim was made and could not
have been made within 30 days as stipulated in Condition 15 of the Way Bill. In essence Condition
15 was to impose additional obligation upon the owner of CS(OS)614A/2002 Page 17 consignee
because it stipulated giving of the notice either from the date of the arrival of the goods at the
destination which more oftener than not, is not known to the owner of the goods, or from the date of
booking, which again is useless because unless loss or damage occurs no liability arises."
(underlining added) I have reproduced the portions of the judgment from the head note because the
head note portion faithfully reproduces the relevant ratio of the judgment.
14. A Division Bench of this court has also recently considered the legal position under Section 23 of
the Contract Act in the judgment reported as Ircon International Ltd. Vs. NBCC 155 (2008) DLT
226. The relevant paragraphs of this judgment are paras 15,20,21,27 and 28:
15 .The learned Counsel for the appellant has also relied upon AIR 2006 SC 963,
(2006) 6 SCC 315, AIR 1965 Pat. 239, AIR 1996 All. 72 and AIR (37) 1950 Lah. 174
wherein the part of the arbitration agreement, "which makes the arbitrator(cid:128)s
determination „final(cid:128) and binding between the parties" and declares that the parties
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198200255/ 14M/S. Simplex Concrete Piles ... vs Union Of India on 23 February, 2010
have waived the right of an appeal or objection „in any jurisdiction(cid:128), has been held to
be hit by Section 28 of the Contract Act and also being against public policy
20. After considering the judgments relied upon by the appellant and discussed by us
above, we are of the opinion that a person may waive his rights. Such waiver of rights
is permissible even in relation to a benefit conferred under the law. But it is trite that
no right can be waived where public policy or public interest is involved. The contract
between the parties must be in obedience to law and not in derogation thereof.
Contracting out is permissible provided it does not deal with a matter of public
policy. An agreement under no circumstances can violate the public policy
[Centrotrade Minerals and Metal Inc. v. Hindustan Copper Ltd., 2006 (11) SCC 245].
21. Section 28 of the Contract Act which provides for agreements in restraint of legal
proceedings as void, the parties cannot by a contract seek to exclude the application
of a statutory provision as it is not valid Mukul Dutta Gupta v.
Indian Airlines Corpn., AIR 1962 Cal. 1311. The most obvious and direct form of contracting out of a
statute is where a party agrees not to make a claim for a benefit for which a statute provides. But it
may take many other forms, varying with the nature, subject matter and the object or purpose of the
statute, and the means selected to escape from its provisions or its operations. Express
CS(OS)614A/2002 Page 18 statutory prohibitions against contracting out renders void an agreement
or clause that is inconsistent with it. But when there is no express prohibition in the statute, an
agreement; the operation of which defeats or circumvents the purpose or policy of the statute, would
also be barred.
27. The object of the rule is, that no party/person should be left remedy less. Necessary corollary to
this would be that, if no adequate remedy is provided for by a special statute through the Forum
established under it for a particular purpose/situation, civil Courts remedy to administer justice
cannot be said to be ousted to deal with even such cases.
28. So far as the part in the arbitration clause in the said agreement regarding the non-applicability
of the Act of 1996 is concerned, we consider that it is void and the parties cannot by themselves
exclude the statute itself which is being drafted by the Legislature to look after the arbitration
matters.
(underlining is mine)
15. The issue therefore boils down to whether rights which are created by Section 73 and 55 of the
Contract Act can or cannot be contractually waived. If there is a public policy or public interest
element in these Sections, then the rights under these sections cannot be waived. Let us examine the
matter. If we look at that portion of the Contract Act, 1872 till Section 73 it broadly comprises of
three parts. The first part is the formation and the requirements for the formation of a legal
agreement/contract. The second part deals with the performance thereof. The third part deals with
the effect of breach of the contract.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198200255/ 15M/S. Simplex Concrete Piles ... vs Union Of India on 23 February, 2010
Provisions pertaining to the effect of breach of contract, two of which provisions are Sections 73 and
55, in my opinion, are the very heart, foundation and the basis for existence of the Contract Act. This
is because a contract which can be broken at will, will destroy the very edifice of the Contract Act.
After all, why enter into a contract in the first place when such contracts can be CS(OS)614A/2002
Page 19 broken by breaches of the other party without any consequential effect upon the guilty
party? It therefore is a matter of public policy that the sanctity of the contracts and the bindingness
thereof should be given precedence over the entitlement to breach the same by virtue of contractual
clauses with no remedy to the aggrieved party. Contracts are entered into because they are
sacrosanct. If Sections 73 and 55 are not allowed to prevail, then, in my opinion, parties would in
fact not even enter into contracts because commercial contracts are entered into for the purpose of
profits and benefits and which elements will be non-existent if deliberate breaches without any
consequences on the guilty party are permitted. If there has to be no benefit and commercial gain
out of a contract, because, the same can be broken at will without any consequences on the guilty
party, the entire sub-stratum of contractual relations will stand imploded and exploded. It is
inconceivable that in contracts performance is at the will of a person without any threat or fear of
any consequences of a breach of contract. Putting it differently, the entire commercial world will be
in complete turmoil if the effect of Sections 55 and 73 of the Contract Act are taken away.
In view of the observations of the Supreme Court in the case of India Financial (supra) and the
Division Bench of this court in Ircon International (supra) and again of the Supreme Court in the
case of M.G.Brothers, the expressions "public policy" and "if permitted will defeat the
CS(OS)614A/2002 Page 20 provisions of law" in Section 23 have to be interpreted to further the
object of the Contract Act and not defeat the same. That being so, it is clearly a matter public policy
and public interest that the sanctity of the contracts are preserved. To permit a contractual clause
having the object to defeat the very contract itself, is a matter of grave public interest. If such a
Clause is allowed to stand, then, the same will defeat the very basis of existence of the Contract Act.
Having thus expounded at some length I thus need not say any further on the intendment of the
Contract Act and the public interest/public policy behind Sections 55 and 73 thereof.
16. Provisions of the contract which will set at naught the legislative intendment of the Contract Act,
I would hold the same to be void being against public interest and public policy. Such clauses are
also void because it would defeat the provisions of law which is surely not in public interest to
ensure smooth operation of commercial relations. I therefore hold that the contractual clauses such
as Clauses 11A to 11C, on their interpretation to disentitle the aggrieved party to the benefits of
Sections 55 and 73, would be void being violative of Section 23 of the Contract Act. The
interpretation given by the Supreme Court in the Ram Nath International case is a literal and strict
interpretation of clauses whereby the expression "reason beyond the control of the contractor" has
been so strictly and literally interpreted to include even those cases which are on account of the
defaults of the employer itself and but CS(OS)614A/2002 Page 21 for the said judgment I would
have preferred to interpret the clauses in the manner which the Arbitrator has done and not strike
them down by applying Section 23 of the Contract Act. I have also reproduced above the reasoning
given in the Award which in my opinion, would otherwise have been enough to dispose of this case,
however, the said findings in the award being totally against a direct opposite interpretation given to
such clauses by the Supreme Court, would therefore have to give way.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198200255/ 16M/S. Simplex Concrete Piles ... vs Union Of India on 23 February, 2010
17. I may finally note that the Supreme Court in its recent judgment reported as G. Ramachandra
Reddy Vs. UOI, 2009(6) SCC 414 has, though without referring to Section 23 of the Contract Act,
held that a clause in a contract cannot prevent the award of damages although the same are
otherwise payable in law.
18. The issue which now remains to be addressed however is does Ram Nath International's
judgment hold the field or the judgment in Asian Techs Ltd applies? This indeed is a vexed question
and ordinarily, as already stated, I would not have ventured to enter into this area of controversy
but, since, the learned senior counsel for the petitioner has very strongly pressed for decision on this
aspect also, I am accordingly adverting to this aspect. Before doing so, I may note that both the
judgments of Asian Techs Ltd. and Ram Nath International are of benches of two Judges. Further,
the decision in Asian Techs case does not refer to the judgment of Ram Nath International
CS(OS)614A/2002 Page 22 case although identical clauses have also been dealt with in the Asian
Techs case. In terms of the various Full Bench judgments of different High Courts and the Division
Bench judgment of this Court, I have the onerous obligation, as the learned senior counsel for the
petitioner put, to decide that which of the two judgments should operate. One way in my opinion,
would be that the effect of the two cases and the ratio of the two cases can be said to be
distinguishable because the judgment in the Ram Nath International case , does not deal with the
position that Arbitrators right to award such damages is unfettered and a contractual clauses which
debars payment of damages only prevents the department from doing so. That however, would be
an over simplification, because, both the judgments squarely deal with the issue of an arbitration
Award entitling or disentitling a contractor for damages.
19. In my opinion, if I look at the issue from both the micro and macro positions, keeping in focus
the intendment of legislation called the Contract Act, then, the judgment in the case of Asian Techs
Ltd. can be said to laying down a law which would further the object and purpose of the Contract
Act. I must hasten to add that I am still doubtful whether I am entitled to decide the aspect that out
of two decisions of Supreme Court, which one is to prevail, therefore, my observations are strictly in
terms of the limited parameters of the facts of the present case required to decide the aspect of the
entitlement or the disentitlement to damages in view of the provisions of Section 55 and 73 of the
CS(OS)614A/2002 Page 23 Contract Act. I would with all due respect to the learned senior counsel
for the petitioner, would not venture further and would leave it finally for a larger Bench of this
court or the Supreme Court itself to consider whether at all there is any conflict between the
judgments of Ram Nath International and Asian Techs Ltd and if there is a conflict, the ratio of
which of the two judgments ought to prevail. I am therefore, deciding this case, to make things very
clear, only on the basis of the decision that contractual clauses which prohibit the entitlement to
rightful damages of a person is clearly hit and are void by virtue of Section 23 of the Contract Act.
20. For the purposes of record, I may say that no other issue was pressed before me by the objector
except this issue of disentitlement of the claimant/petitioner/non-applicant to damages on the basis
of Clauses 11 A to 11C of the Contract Act and as per the interpretation thereof in Ramnath
International's case.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/198200255/ 17M/S. Simplex Concrete Piles ... vs Union Of India on 23 February, 2010
21. I may note that the argument of the objector with regard to the fact that damages could not have
been decided by the Arbitrator was sought to be canvassed by the learned senior counsel for the
petitioner as being barred by "res judicata" because of an order passed in a petition under Section
20 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, referring all the disputes including the present dispute of damages
for decision by the Arbitrator, but, in view of my other findings given above, I am not pronouncing
upon this issue which has been canvassed and CS(OS)614A/2002 Page 24 argued by the learned
senior counsel for the petitioner. Mr.V.P. Chaudhary, appearing for the petitioner very fairly does
not press his objections being I.A. No. 11421/2003. Interest at the rate of 9% per annum is awarded
on the awarded amount from the date of this judgment till payment under Section 29 of the
Arbitration Act, 1940. The award is made rule of the court. Let the decree be drawn in terms of
thereof. Parties to bear their own costs.
