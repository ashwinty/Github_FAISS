1. In Broom's Legal Maxims, Tenth Edition, Indian Economy Reprint 1995, the following passages
occur at pages 90, 91 and 120, respectively :--
"It has been an ancient observation in the laws of England, that, whenever a standing rule of law, of
which the reason, perhaps, could not be remembered or discerned, has been wantonly broken in
upon by statutes or new resolutions, the wisdom of the rule has in the end appeared from the
inconveniences that have followed the innovation (o); and the sages of the law have, therefore,
always suppressed new and subtle inventions in derogation of the common law (p).
It is, then, an established rule to abide by former precedents, stare decisis, where the same points
come again in litigation, as well to keep the scale of justice steady and not liable to waver with every
new Judge's opinion, as also because, the law in that case being solemnly declared, what before was
uncertain and perhaps indifferent, is now become a permanent rule, which it is not in the breast of
any subsequent Judge to alter according to his private sentiments; he being sworn to determine, not
according to his own private judgment (q), but according to the known laws of the land--not
delegated to pronounce a new law, but to maintain the old (r)--jus dicere et non jus dare [s).
Accordingly where a rule has become settled law, it is to be followed, although some possible
inconvenience may grow from a strict observance of it, or although a satisfactory reason for it is
wanting, or although the principle and the policy of the rule may be questioned (z). If, as has been
observed, there is a general hardship affecting a general class of cases, it is a consideration for the
Legislature, not for a Court of justice. If there is a particular hardship from the particular
circumstances of the case, nothing can be more dangerous or mischievous than upon those
particular circumstances to deviate from a general rule of law (a); "hard cases", it has repeatedly
been said, are apt to "make bad law" (b).
It may seem a hardship upon the person suffering the damage that he is without remedy; but by that
consideration the Courts ought not to be influenced. "Hard cases, it has frequently been observed,
are apt to introduce bad law" (u).
2. I am constrained to reiterate the aforesaid principles at the very threshold of the judgment as a
reminder to myself. This was necessitated by the eloquent and persistent arguments of Mr. R. K.
Chhibbar, learned Senior Counsel, who has argued with a great deal of compassion and made every
effort to evoke sympathy of this Court for plaintiff No. 2, Smt. Pushpa Mehra.
3. This Regular Second Appeal has been directed against the judgment and decree dated 17-10-1998
passed by Shri P. S. Virk, Additional Civil Judge (Senior Division), Amritsar, whereby the suit for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1879965/ 1Atul Mehra And Anr. vs Bank Of Maharashtra on 22 March, 2002
recovery for a sum of Rs. 4,26,160/- instituted by the appellants against the defendants-bank, has
been dismissed with costs and the judgment and decree passed by the learned District Judge,
Amritsar, on 9-1-2001, whereby the appeal filed by the appellants against the judgment and decree
dated 17-10-1998, has been dismissed. The learned Lower Appellate Court has ordered that the
parties are left to bear their own costs.
4. The pleaded case of the appellants i.e., plaintiffs in the trial Court is that they hired locker No. 75
on 15-1-1986 from the respondent-bank i.e. defendant in the trial Court and respondent in the
Lower Appellate Court as well as in this Court. According to the appellants, they had deposited
jewellery in the value of Rs. 4,26,160/- as detailed in Annexure-A to the plaint. The
respondent-bank on account of its misconduct and negligence did not take proper care of the lockers
and the strong room which were built at the back of the building. According to the appellants, the
alleged strong room was made up affair and it was made only of plywood, whereas it ought to have
been made of iron and concrete. All the 44 lockers in the alleged strong room of the
respondent-bank were broken by miscreants and the contents thereof were stolen. The value of the
jewellery which was kept in the locker by the appellants was Rs. 4,26,160/-. First Information
Report was lodged with the police on 9-1-1989. All the 44 locker holders made representation to the
defendant on 2-2-1989 by a registered acknowledgment due pointing out the gross negligence and
misconduct of the respondent-bank in maintaining the lockers. A representation to this effect was
also made to the Ministry of Finance, Government of India, on 20-2-1989, The Senior
Superintendent of Police, Amritsar, was also informed regarding the burglary. The appellants made
several representations to the defendant-bank, but the respondent-bank went on to evade the
demands on one pretext or the other. None of the representations of the appellants was answered by
the defendant-bank. In the meantime, the police made a report on 21-7-1989 about the defective
strong room and the lockers therein. Since the bank had failed to return the jewellery, the appellants
were constrained to institute suit in the trial Court.
5. The respondent-bank appeared and contested the suit. It was claimed that no cause of action has
arisen in favour of the appellants to file the suit. The appellants had no locus standi to bring the suit
against the respondents. It was specifically pleaded that there was no statutory or contractual
liability on the respondent to make good the loss allegedly suffered by the appellants. On merits, the
respondent-bank denied the averments made by the appellants in the plaint. The bank has,
however, admitted that the appellants had taken locker No. 75 from the respondent-bank on
15-1-1986. It was categorically denied that Jewellery in the value of Rs. 4,26,160/- was kept in the
locker. It was also denied that there was any misconduct or negligence on the part of the
respondent-bank in taking care of the lockers and strong room. The respondent-bank denied the
so-called police report dated 21-7-1989. It was, however, admitted that the lockers were broken by
miscreants and content of the same were stolen.
6. The appellants filed replication. They controverted the contents of the written statement and
reiterated the facts stated in the plaint.
7. On the pleadings of the parties, the trial Court framed the following issues :--
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1879965/ 2Atul Mehra And Anr. vs Bank Of Maharashtra on 22 March, 2002
1. Whether the plaintiffs have suffered loss due to misconduct and negligence by the defendant?
OPP
2. If issue No. 1 is proved, whether the plaintiffs are entitled to recover any amount. If so, to what
amount? OPP
3. Whether the defendant-Bank has no contractual liability to make good loss incurred by the
plaintiffs? OPP
4. Whether the plaintiffs have no cause of action or locus standi to file the present suit? OPD
5. Relief.
8. In order to prove their case, the appellants examined PW-1 Madan Lal Wadhwa, PW-2 Rajesh
Kumar, Constable who proved copy of F.I.R. Ex. PW-2/2 and copy of report of Police, Ex. PW-2/3,
PW-3 Ranjit Singh, Manager of the respondent-bank, PW-4 Gurmit Chand, DSP, PW-5 Sushil
Kumar Verma, PW-6 Smt. Urmil Sagar and the appellants stepped into witness box as PW-7 and
PW-8, respectively, before they closed their evidence. On the other hand, the respondent-bank
examined its Senior Manager as DW-1 and closed its evidence.
9. After considering the evidence, produced by the rival parties, the learned trial Court decided issue
Nos. 1, 2 and 3 against the appellants and issue No. 4 was not pressed and thus, it was decided
against the respondent. Vide impugned judgment and decree the suit of the appellants was
dismissed with costs.
10. The learned Lower Appellate Court has upheld the findings given by the learned trial Court.
Hence, the present Regular Second Appeal.
11. I have heard the learned Counsel for the parties at length and gone through the record of the case
very carefully.
12. Mr. R. K. Chhibbar, learned Senior Advocate, has argued the matter with his usual tenacity
backed by meticulous preparation. In the memorandum of appeal, six substantial questions of law
have been formulated. At the time of argument, Mr. Chhibbar has raised six additional points. In my
view, the points sought to be raised are covered by the issues framed by the trial Court. One
additional question of law can be formulated thus :--
"Would the relationship between the locker hirer and the bank fall within the definition of bailment
as given in Section 148 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, merely on the locker being hired; or is it
necessary also to prove by independent evidence entrustment, quantity, quality and value of the
property claimed?"
13. Thereafter, on facts, the controversy in the present case has been aptly summed up in issue Nos.
1 to 3 framed by the learned trial Court. To be fair, it must be noticed that Mr. Chhibbar has also
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1879965/ 3Atul Mehra And Anr. vs Bank Of Maharashtra on 22 March, 2002
argued that the findings recorded by both the learned Courts below are based on misreading of the
evidence. He has further submitted that the findings of the learned Courts below are erroneous, as
they are based on the judgment of this Court in the case of Mohinder Singh Nanda v. Bank of
Maharashtra, 1998 ISJ (Banking) 673, which according to the learned Counsel, is per incuriam.
14. Firstly, Mr. Chhibbar had argued that both the learned Courts below have failed to consider vital
pieces of evidence. This failure in Itself would raise a substantive question of law. There is no
dispute with the aforesaid proposition of law. The law on this point has been recently reiterated by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ishwar Dass Jain (dead) through L.Rs. v. Sohan Lal (dead)
by L.Rs. 1999 (9) JT (SC) 305 : (AIR 2000 SC 426). It has been held that the High Court can
interfere with the concurrent findings of fact recorded by the Courts below if vital pieces of evidence
have not been considered which, if considered, would have led to a different conclusion. In light of
the aforesaid ratio, I have perused the Judgments of both the learned Courts below very carefully
and I have also gone through the record of the case meticulously. A perusal of the Judgment of the
learned trial Court shows that learned trial Court has meticulously considered the entire evidence
led by the parties. It has been held that there was a legal contract between the appellants and the
respondent-bank. The learned trial Court on the basis of the evidence came to the conclusion that a
robbery did take place in the bank. The lockers were opened with a gas cylinder. The robbery was
beyond the control of the Bank Manager. It has further been held that the respondent-bank was
obliged to keep the locker intact. Thereafter, it has been held that the locker is operated without any
knowledge to the respondent-bank as to how many articles and of how much weight and value have
been stored in the locker. These facts are personal to the customer. It has been held that the
contents of the locker were never brought to the notice of the respondent-bank. There is merely oral
statement of the appellants with regard to the contents of the locker. Therefore, the judgments cited
by the learned Counsel for the plaintiffs have been distinguished by the learned trial Court. The
learned trial Court has also held that there was no negligence on the part of the Bank Manager. The
report given by the police Ex. PW-2/3 has been ignored on the ground that the Police Officer was
not an expert. It has also been held by the learned trial Court that he was not required to give a
report with regard to the construction of the strong room or the lockers. The learned trial Court,
thereafter, held that the appellants could have produced a building expert who could have thrown
some light as to whether the strong room was built in accordance with the norms. No such expert
having been produced, the report Ex. PW-2/3 has been ignored. I am of the considered opinion that
the aforesaid findings given by the learned trial Court can neither be said to be based on no
evidence, nor can they be said to be perverse.
15. The learned Lower Appellate Court while confirming these findings of fact has noticed the
submissions made by the learned Counsel for the appellants. The evidence has also been thoroughly
examined. It has been held that from the evidence pro-
duced by the parties, negligence cannot be attributed to the respondent-bank because it was a case
of burglary and the officials cannot apprehend that such a situation shall arise. This apart, the
learned Lower Appellate Court takes note of the fact that not only the respondent-bank denied the
knowledge about the contents of the locker, but, even PW-7 Smt. Pushpa Mehra, plaintiff No. 2, had
admitted in her cross-examination that the list of the contents of the locker were never supplied to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1879965/ 4Atul Mehra And Anr. vs Bank Of Maharashtra on 22 March, 2002
the respondent-bank. Therefore, the learned Lower Appellate Court came to the conclusion that
there was no entrustment of the goods allegedly kept in the locker by the appellants. The learned
Lower Appellate Court again held that the contents of the strong room/ lockers could not be proved
by the report of Deputy Superintendent of Police, Gurmit Chand (PW-4) and the statements of the
witnesses alone. Again it has been held that the appellants could have proved the factual position
with regard to the nature and quality of the strong room and the lockers by producing an expert
witness, such as Civil Engineer. In such circumstances, it would not be possible to agree with the
submissions made by Mr. Chhibbar that the concurrent findings of fact recorded by the learned
Courts below are based on a misreading of the evidence.
16. Mr. Chhibbar has, painstakingly, argued that the relationship between the appellants and the
respondent-bank was that of a bailor and bailee as given in Section 148 of the Indian Contract Act,
1872. According to the learned Counsel, once it is accepted that the relationship between the parties
is that of "bailment", the lack of knowledge of the contents of the locker by respondent-bank would
not affect their liability to compensate the appellants. Learned Counsel relied on the commentary
contained in Paget's Law of Banking, Ninth Edition. 1982, Chapter II, Relation of Banker to
Customer, VII-Safe Custody.
17. In this commentary, it is stated that "the banker's knowledge or ignorance of the nature of the
goods entrusted to him would seem not to affect his liability". This observation has been made on
the basis of the law laid down in the case of Giblin v. Me Mullen, (1868) LR 2 PC 317, wherein it is
held that "a gratuitous bailee is bound to take the same care of the property entrusted to him as a
reasonably prudent and careful man may fairly be expected to take of his own property of the like
description". A perusal of the very same commentary, however, shows that the aforesaid decision
was "gravely doubted" by the Privy Council in the case of Port Swettenham Authority v. T. W. Wu
and Co. (M) SDN, BHD, 1979 Appeal Cases 580 at 589. On the basis of the aforesaid judgment of the
Privy Council, it has been observed in the same commentary that "a banker is under no obligation to
accept a parcel for safe custody and where he is asked to do so, could ask to know its contents and
value in order to gauge the nature and extent of any possible liability; but it is submitted that he
need not inquire". I am of the considered opinion that these observations are clearly contrary to the
submissions made by Mr. Chhibbar. The respondent-bank could only be fastened with liability on
the contents of the locker being disclosed to it. In the absence of this information, it would have to
be held that there was no entrustment of the goods to constitute bailment as required under Section
148 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.
18. Mr. Chhibbar has also cited a number of cases to illustrate the law in England with regard to
bailment. The authorities cited by the learned Counsel are as follows :--
1. Coldman v. Hill, 1919 (1) KB 443. This case related to the loss of cattle which were left in the
custody of an Agister of cattle. It was held that the farmer had failed to inform the owner or the
police of the theft of the cattle. It was held that even though the cattle had been stolen without the
fault of the farmer, he was liable to pay for the loss.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1879965/ 5Atul Mehra And Anr. vs Bank Of Maharashtra on 22 March, 2002
2. Hunt & Winterbotham (West of England) Ltd. v. B.R.S. (Parcels) Ltd., (1962) 1 QB 617. In this
case, it has been held as follows :--
"If an owner of goods leaves them with another person, who undertakes to mind them for reward,
and then fails to produce them when they are wanted, it is a reasonable inference, in the absence of
any explanation, that he cannot have looked after them properly : in other words, that he has at least
been negligent. Accordingly, it is right to say in such a case, as McNair, J. did in Woolmer v. Delmer
Price Ltd., that it is for the depositee to show that he has not been negligent, and that to such an
extent, at any rate, the onus is upon the depositee."
3. Houghland v. R. R. Low (Luxury Coaches) Ltd., (1962) 2 All England Reporter 159, again it is held
that it is for the defendant to establish affirmatively, not only that the goods were stolen, but that
they were stolen without default on his part; in other words, that there was no negligence on his part
in the care which he took of the goods. In that case, the plaintiff and her husband had placed the suit
cases which were loaded into the boot of the coach which was locked by the driver. The coach
developed some mechanical trouble. It was necessary to load the luggage into the relief coach. On
arrival at the destination, the couple found that their suit cases were missing from the boot of the
relief coach. Since, the suit cases were in the exclusive custody of the coach driver, damages were
awarded to the plaintiffs.
4. Port Swettenham Authority v. T. W. Wu and Co. (M) SDN BHD, 1979 AC 580. it has been again
held that where bailed goods were lost from the custody of the bailee (whether he was a gratuitous
bailee or bailee for reward) the onus was on him to prove that the loss was not due to his failure to
exercise the care required by law.
5. Union of India v. M/s. Udho Ram & Sons, AIR 1963 SC 422, it has been held that evidence should
be offered by the bailee with respect to the extent of the precautions taken to protect the goods
entrusted. It has been held that Section 151 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, states that in all cases
of bailment, the bailee is bound to take as much care of the goods bailed to him as a man of ordinaiy
prudence would, under similar circumstances, take of his own goods of the same bulk, quality and
value as the goods bailed. It was found that the railway administration had failed to exercise due
care for protecting the goods of the bailor.
6. The New India Assurance Co. Ltd. v. The Delhi Development Authority, (1991-2) PLR (Delhi
Section) 82, it has been held that the essence of bailment is possession. The possession of the truck
was handed over to the defendants when the truck was parked in the Parking Centre of the
defendants. The defendants had issued a receipt and charged Rs. 3/- for the safe keeping of the
vehicle for a period of 24 hours. Immediately at that time a contract of bailment came into being.
The defendants as bailee having failed to deliver the vehicle back to the second plaintiff within the
contracted period and not having shown to have exercised any prudent care for the safety of the
truck, are liable for its loss.
19. These authorities are of no assistance to the appellants in the present, rase. In all these cases,
exclusive possession of the property had been handed over by the bailor to the bailee. 1 am of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1879965/ 6Atul Mehra And Anr. vs Bank Of Maharashtra on 22 March, 2002
considered opinion that, exclusive possession is sine qua non for bailment. Therefore, I have no
hesitation in coming to the conclusion that mere hiring of a locker would not be sufficient to
constitute a contract of bailment as provided under Section 148 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. In
order to constitute bailment, as provided in Section 148 of the Act, it is further necessary to show
that the actual exclusive possession of the property was given by the hirer of the locker to the bank.
It is only thereafter !hat the question of reasonable care and quantum of damages would arise. In
the present case, it is impossible to know the quantity, quality or the value of the jewellery that was
allegedly kept in the locker at the time when the robbery occurred, The only evidence relied upon by
the appellants is a statement made by DW-1, in cross-examination where it is stated that he cannot
admit or deny that there was jewellery weighing 1273 grams worth Rs. 4,26,160/- are kept in the
locker. This statement, would not be sufficient to hold that the appellants have proved that there
was entrustment of the jewellery to the respondent-bank. In all the authorities (supra) the common
feature is that exclusive possession of known property was given by the bailor to the bailee. In the
present case, the plaintiffs alone had the knowledge ot contents of locker, therefore, the plaintiffs
had to lead independent; evidence to prove that the jewellery was actually in the locker on the date
of the robbery. Even if the plaintiffs had proved this peculiar facts; they would still have to prove the
value of the jewellery. No evidence, except the bald statement of the plaintiffs, and the list
Annexure-A, has been produced by the plaintiffs. Therefore, clearly the plaintiffs have failed to
prove entrustment of the jewellery to constitute bailment as required under Section 148 of the
Indian Contract Act, 1872.
20. Mr. Chhibbar, had placed heavy reliance on the judgment of this Court in Na tional Bank of
Lahore Ltd., Delhi v. Sohan Lal Saigal, AIR 1962 Punjab 534, wherein it has been held that "a person
who hires, a locker retains some control over it by having one key with himself but if the locker can
be operated without any key, (as was possible in the lockers which were rented out to the plaintiffs),
then at once any impediment in the way of control and possession of the Bank to whom the locker
belongs and in whose strong room it is to be found, wuld be removed mid it can well be said that the
bank is strictly in the position of a bailee. This is an additional ground for making the Hank liable
along with his liability as the master for the fraudulent and criminal acts of the servant committed in
the course of his employment."
21. Mr. Chhibbar has also argued that both the learned Courts below have wrongly relied on the
judgment of this Court rendered in the case of Mohinder Singh Narida v. Bank of Maharnshtra.
1998 KSJ (Banking) 673. In paragraph 4 of this judgment, it is observed as follows :--
"It is an admitted fact that the plaintiffs hired a locker bearing No. 11 from the defendant-bank and
according to them they placed certain jewellery in the locker and there was a theft on 9-1-1989 in the
strong room which was broken by the miscreants. But there is no evidence on record to show that
the defendant-Bank had the knowledge of the articles in the locker. Unless there is entrust ment of
the property to the defend ant-Bank, the Bank cannot be held responsible for the theft. The plaintiffs
have miserably failed to prove that there was by en-trustment of ihe articles with the
defendant-Bank and that the Bank authorities were aware of the articles placed in the locker. The
plaintiffs have also tailed to prove that there was any contract between the Bank and the plaintifls to
reimburse the plaintiffs for any loss of the articles kept in the locker. In the absence of any such
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1879965/ 7Atul Mehra And Anr. vs Bank Of Maharashtra on 22 March, 2002
evidence, the defendant-Bank cannot be held responsible for the theft of the articles in the locker. It
is not a case where any employee of the Bank committed a theft. In this view of the matter, I am of
the opinion that both the Courts below have rightly come to the conclusion that the defendant-Bank
is not liable for any loss of the articles kept in the locker."
22. The aforesaid judgment does not lay down any law which can be said to be contrary to law laid
down by the Division Bench of this Court in the case of National Bank of Lahore Ltd., Delhi v. Sohan
Lal Saigal, AIR 1962 Punjab 534. In that case, the learned trial Court had held that entrustment and
the valuation of the jewellery had been proved. The discussion with regard to this point is in
paragraph 9 of the aforesaid judgment. On the twin grounds of exclusive possession of the jewellery
deposited in the locker and entrustment thereof to the Bank, it has been held that the Bank would be
in the position of bailee. Thereafter, the Bank was held liable because the jewellery was stolen by the
Manager. This could not have been done without the negligence of the Bank. The observations of the
Division Bench, made in paragraph 9 of the judgment, are as under (at Pages 538-539) :--
The next submission on behalf of the appellant relates to the finding given by the trial Court on issue
No. 9. There is a full and complete discussion of the evidence and other facts and circumstances on
which it was found that the plaintiffs had suffered loss to the extent to which the suits were decreed.
There can be no doubt that the plaintiffs had adduced all the evidence that could in the very nature
of things be produced in a matter like this and the learned Counsel for the appellant has not been
able to satisfy us that the appreciation of that evidence by the Court below is in any way defective or
open to criticism. His sole attack was confined to one aspect of the matter. It has been urged that the
lists of articles of jewellery which the plaintiffs claimed to have deposited in the lockers had been
exaggerated inasmuch as the original lists which the plaintiffs claimed to have in their possession
and which were prepared every time they operated upon the lockers, were not produced before the
police along with the first information report which was lodged as soon as it was found that the
articles had disappeared from the lockers.
Plaintiff-Sohan Lal Saigal, who appeared as C.W. 18, stated that the Station House Officer did not
ask for the production of the original lists of the property in the lockers which had been prepared by
the plaintiffs for their private reference. Actually, as has been noticed by the trial Court, Shrimati
Durga Devi who appeared as C.W. 16 stated that she wanted to give the list in Gurmukhi (Exhibit
C.W. 16/3) to the police at the time of making the first information report but the police said that
they wanted a list of the stolen property only. These lists were subsequently produced in Court
before the Magistrate in the criminal trial. The statement of the plaintiff is corroborated by Shri Baij
Nath (P.W. 9), who was the Investigating Officer in the criminal case (page 123). The learned
Counsel for the appellant has not been able to show that there was any discrepancy in the lists which
were given at the time when the first information report was recorded and the so-called original lists
which had been kept by the plaintiffs for their private record and which were produced later on at
the trial except that in the lists given with the first information report, the names of jewellers etc.
were given. But there was admittedly no discrepancy so far as the number and description of articles
were concerned. The trial Court accepted the explanation given by the plaintiffs in the matter of
non-production of the original lists at the earliest opportunity and we are satisfied that in view of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1879965/ 8Atul Mehra And Anr. vs Bank Of Maharashtra on 22 March, 2002
police not having demanded the same earlier, the plaintiffs were not bound to produce these lists
along with the first information report. In any case this fact alone will not take away the authenticity
and veracity of the other evidence which had been believed by the trial Court and against which the
learned Counsel for the appellant has not been able to point out anything. The finding arrived at
must consequently be confirmed."
23. These observations make it abundantly clear that the plaintiffs therein had given all possible
evidence to prove exclusive possession of the jewellery by the bank. Both the learned trial Court as
well as the learned lower Appellate Court had held that entrustment of the jewellery to the Bank
stood established. These concurrent findings of fact have been affirmed by the Division Bench of this
Court. The observations of the Division Bench are of no assistance to the appellants in the present
case. The fact situation in Mohinder Singh Nanda's case (supra) is wholly different, where both the
learned Courts below, after appreciating the evidence have concluded that the plaintiffs have failed
to prove entrustmerit of the jewellery to the Bank. Therefore, the judgment cannot be labelled as per
incurium. What is meant by expression per incurium, was considered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in the case of The Punjab Land Development & Reclamation Corporation Ltd., Chandigarh v. The
Presiding Officer, Labour Court, Chandigarh, 1990 (2) JT (SC) 489. In this case, it has been held
that the Latin expression per incurium means through inadvertence. In paragraph 44 of the
judgment aforesaid, it has been observed that "in England a decision is said to be given per incurium
when the Court has acted in ignorance of a previous decision of its own or of a Court of co-ordinate
jurisdiction which covered the case before it, or when it has acted in ignorance of a decision of the
House of Lords". This meaning of the expression per incurium has been approved in paragraph 45
of the judgment wherein it is observed that "the position and experience in this Court could not be
much different, keeping in view the need for proper development of law and justice".
24. Having come to the conclusion that the judgment in Mohinder Singh Nanda's case is not per
incurium, it has to be noticed that the aforesaid judgment pertains to the same incident in which 44
lockers were broken and the contents of the same were stolen. The judgment is, therefore, binding
on this Court.
25. Mr. Ashok Pal Jagga, learned Counsel for the respondent-Bank, countering the arguments of Mr.
Chhibbar. has argued that agreement between the parties constitute the relationship of landlord and
tenant. The agreement uses the term "rent and hirer". A hiring agreement cannot be equated with
the bailment. Furthermore, the agreement provides for a written notice to be given for termination
of the agreement. This, according to Mr. Jagga, is in consonance with Section 106 of the Transfer of
Property Act, which provides for giving a notice for termination of the tenancy. This argument of
Mr. Jagga, is without any merit. I am of the considered opinion that hiring of a locker is a
transaction wholly distinct in nature from a transaction that would create the relationship of
landlord and tenant. In the case of tenancy exclusive possession of the demised premises has to be
surrendered by the landlord to the tenant. In the case of bailment exclusive possession of the
property has to be given by the bailor to the bailee. Whatever property is deposited in the locker is,
undoubtedly, in the custody and possession of the bank. Merely because the locker can be operated
only in the presence of the locker hirer would not amount to joint possession of the locker. The
Banker can always open the locker with a "master key". The hirer of the locker is not in a position to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1879965/ 9Atul Mehra And Anr. vs Bank Of Maharashtra on 22 March, 2002
open the locker without the assistance of the bank. The hirer has access to the locker only during
specified banking hours. The banker has no such limitation. It must, however be noticed thai, the
transaction of bailment would only be established if the provisions of Section 148 of the Indian
Contract Act are complied with. With regard to this, it is the submission of Mr. Jagga that the
plaintiffs have miserably failed to prove that the jewellery was kept in the locker as claimed in the
plaint. There being no entrustment or delivery of possession. Section 148 of the Act cannot be
invoked by the plaintiffs. I find substance in this submission of the learned Counsel. The plaintiffs
have failed to make out a case of bailment, in accordance with Section 148 of the Indian Contract
Act. which provides the conditions precedent for constituting bailment. These are : (1) There has to
be delivery of goods by bailor to bailee; (ii) There has to be a contract to return the goods or the
property on the instructions of the bailor. The explanation to Section 148 of the Indian Contract Act,
1872, shows that possession by itself is not enough. Section 149 of the Act envisages that delivery
may be made by doing anything which has the effect of putting the goods in the possession of the
bailee. As observed in the earlier part of this judgment, there is no evidence on the record except the
bald statement of plaintiff No. 2 and the list Annexure-A, to prove that the jewellery was kept in the
locker at the time when the robbery took place. Thus, the learned Courts below have correctly held
that the plaintiffs have failed to prove entrustment of the jewellery to the Bank. In the case of
Kaliaperuman Pillai v. Visalakshmi Achi, AIR 1938 Mad 32, considering the provisions contained in
Sections 148 and 149 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, it has been held as follows (at Pages 32-33)
:--
"Under the provisions of Sections 148 and 149, Contract Act. delivery is necessary to con-
stltute the bailment. It is true that the delivery may be made by doing anything which has the effect
of putting the goods in the possession of the intended bailee; but the mere leaving of the box in a
room in the defendant's house, when the plaintiff herself took away the key of that room, cannot
certainly amount to delivery within the meaning of the provision in Section 149. If on these facts, the
plaintiff wanted to fasten a liability upon the defendant for the loss of the goods, she must make out
an affirmative ground of liability, and cannot ask the Court to treat the defendant as a bailee and
throw upon him the onus of accounting for the loss of the jewels. The evidence shows that one
morning, when the plaintiff went into the room to take out the jewels for further work, the jewels
were found missing. It is not the plaintiffs case that on the previous day she handed over the
unfinished jewels to the defendant. I cannot agree with the contention of the learned Counsel for the
respondent that because in the first instance the old jewels were handed over to the defendant the
bailment thereby constituted continued for all time. Everyday when the unfinished jewels were
handed back by the goldsmith to the. plaintiff, the jewels came back to her possession and if at the
later stages she desires to throw upon the defendant the onus of exonerating himself from the
obligations of a bailee, she must prove some acts whereby the articles could be held to have gone
into the defendant's possession. I find no such proof in the present case.
In these circumstances, I do not think it necessary to consider whether, even if the defendant could
be regarded as a bailee, the circumstances are such as to protect him under Sections 151 and 152 of
Contract Act. I must, however, observe that I see nothing whatever in the evidence and in the
circumstances of the case to warrant the learned Judge's suggestion that "It is not unlikely that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1879965/ 10Atul Mehra And Anr. vs Bank Of Maharashtra on 22 March, 2002
defendant appropriated the property and made a show of theft in his house". Though the plaintiff
denies any knowledge of the defendant having complained of theft in his house, her second witness
admits that the defendant did complain of a theft and that the plaintiff was also aware of such
compjalnt. But in the view that I have taken that no bailment has been proved, it is unnecessary to
consider this question further. The revision petition must be allowed and the decree of the lower
Court set aside. The. petitioner will be entitled to his costs in this Court; but I direct that in the lower
pourt each party will bear his costs'."
26. These observations seem to be fully applicable to the facts and circumstances, of this case. There
is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that the jewellery was ever deposited in the locker.
Furthermore, there is no evidence to prove that the value of the jewellery was as claimed by the
plaintiffs. Section 151 of the Act provides for the degree of care to be taken by the bailee of the goods
bailed. In all cases, of bailment the bailee is bound to take as much care of the goods bailed to him as
a man of ordinary prudence would, under similar, circumstances take, of his own goods. No liability
can be fastened on the bailee when the goods are returned in a condition similar to the condition of
the goods at the time of deposit. In any event, Section 152 of the Indian Contract Act. 1872, provides,
that the bailee, in the absence of any special contract, is not responsible for the loss, destruction or
deterioration of the thing bailed, if he has taken the amount of care of it described in Section 151. In
these observations of mine, I am fortified by the observations made by a Division Bench of the
Allahabad High Court in. the case of Shanti Lal v. Tara Chand Madan Gopal, AIR 1933 All 158,
Considering the provisions, of Sections 151 and 152 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, it has been
observed as under (at Page 159) :--
"The standard of diligence required of a bailee under Sections 151 and 152. Contract Act, is that of
the average prudent man; and where the bailee has laken the same care of the property entrusted to
him as a reasonably careful man may be expected to take of his own goods of the same bulk, quality
and volume as the goods bailed, he is not responsible for the loss, destruction or deterioration of the
thing bailed. No cast-iron. standard can be laid down for the measure of the care due from him and
the nature and amount of care must vary with the posture of each case. The Courts below have
arrived at a definite finding that in view of the peculiar circumstances of this case, the bailee has not
been remiss in his obligations to his principal and has not been negligent in the care of the goods
bailed to him, The position of the bailee in this case was one of supreme difficulty. The appearance
of a flood was unknown and unprecedented in the annals of Agra. The factors and godown keepers
had no past experience to guide them. It could not be predicted with certainty that the river would
rise in flood. No forecast could be made of the time of its advent. The plaintiff may well have thought
that if the river rose in flood it may not reach the area where his godown stood. The removal of the
goods to some other locality was perhaps out of the question. For who could say that the flood would
come so far and no further? We are clearly of opinion that the plaintiff was not guilty of negligence
in the discharge of his statutory liability to his principals with reference to the goods entrusted to
him, that he was not responsible for the loss, destruction or deterioration of the thing bailed and
that he was justified in claiming the price thereof from the defendants."
27. These observations are fully applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case. There
is merit in the submission of the learned Counsel for the respondent bank, that both the learned
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1879965/ 11Atul Mehra And Anr. vs Bank Of Maharashtra on 22 March, 2002
Courts below have correctly held that negligence on the part of the respondent-bank has not been
proved.
28. Mr. Chhibbar, learned Senior Advocate, has, however, argued that both the learned Courts
below have failed to take notice of the fact that the strong room as well as the lockers had been built
in contravention of the guidelines on security arrangements in the banks issued by the Indian Banks
Association and the guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India. According to the learned
Counsel, these guidelines are to be strictly construed and strong room was to be built in accordance
with the specification given therein. Learned Counsel has further pointed out that even DW-1, P. K.
Aggarwal, Senior Manager of the respondent-Bank, had admitted that the guidelines issued by the
Indian Banks Association are binding. According to the learned Counsel, both the learned Courts
below have erred in not relying on the report Ex. PW-2/3 given by the police. This witness was not
cross-examined on the point that strong room had not been properly constructed. This evidence was
unimpeachable. In support of this proposition, learned Counsel for the appellants relied on a
Division Bench judgment of the Calcutta High Court in the case of A.E.G. Carapiet v. A. Y.
Derderian, AIR 1961 Cal 359. The learned Courts below, according to the learned Counsel, have also
failed to take note of the admission of DW-I, P. K. Aggarwal, Senior Manager of the
respondent-bank, to the effect that the security guards for protecting the lockers Was only on duty
from 10 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. Mr. Chhibbar has argued that all these facts put together, clearly prove the
negligence on the part of the respondent-bank. According to Mr. Chhibbar the negligence is so gross
that there was no need to offer any independent evidence, as the principle of res ipsa loquitur would
be fully attracted to the facts of the case. These submissions have been made by Mr. Chhibbar on the
presumption that both the learned Courts below have wrongly held that the plaintiffs have failed to
establish a case of bailment, as provided in Section 148 of the Indian Contract Act.
29. I am unable to agree with the submissions made by the learned Counsel for the appellants. A
perusa! of the judgment of the learned lower Appellate Court shows that the Court was fully alive to
the arguments with regard to the principle of res ipsa loquitur. In fact, whole of the evidence pointed
out by the learned Senior Counsel, has been noticed in paragraph 9 of the judgment of the learned
lower Appellate Court. The submissions made by the learned Counsel for the appellants have been
considered in paragraph 11 of the judgment. In support of the submission with regard to the
principle of res ipsa loquitur, Mr. Chhibbar had relied on three judgments. He, first, relied on in the
case of Ramkrishna Ramnath Shop, through Proprietor Radhakisan Ramnath, Kamptee v. Uniori of
India, AIR 1960 Bom 344, wherein a Division Bench has held that the principle of res ipsa loquitur
may be applied to infer negligence but it cannot be applied to infer misconduct. The aforesaid
judgment would not be applicable to the facts of this case as in that case handing over of 340 bags of
Tobacco to the Southern Railway for being carried to its destination, was admitted. In the present
case, it has come in evidence that the respondent-bank has no knowledge of the contents of the
locker. Mr. Chhibbar has then relied on a judgment in the case; of Shri Ram Pertap s/o Ch. Ratti
Ram v. General Manager, Punjab Roadways, Ambala, AIR 1962 Punjab 540. In the aforesaid case, it
has been held as follows (at Page 542) :--
"Insofar as the first point, is concerned, the contention raised is really based on the maxim res ipsa
loquitur. This maxim, as I understand its purport, suggests that on the circumstances of a given case
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1879965/ 12Atul Mehra And Anr. vs Bank Of Maharashtra on 22 March, 2002
the Res Speaks and is eloquent because the farts stand unexplained, with the result that the natural
and reasonable inference from the facts--not a conjectural inference--shows that the act is
attributable I o some person's negligent conduct. The effect of this maxim, however, depends on the
eogeney of the inferences to be drawn and must, therefore, vary in each case. Its effect appears to be
to shift the burden or onus of proof on to the defendant who is expected to show as to how the
accident may have occurred without his negligence. There is undoubtedly a divergence of judicial
opinion as Lo the extent of the onus but in the case in hand that question does not arise and,
therefore, it is unnecessary for me to advert to it. The Claims Tribunal has found that the bus in
question skidded on account of the wet condition of the road, as originally mentioned by the
claimant in the complaint book. This finding has not been successfully challenged on behalf of the
appellant and as a matter of fact no argument has been addressed in respect of this finding on the
merits.
The contention raised, however, is that it was not possible for the vehicle to skid if there had been no
negligence on the part of the driver; in other words, the vehicle could only skid if there was some
serious defect in it. I would grant that a skid in itself does not excuse the accident and it may not
suffice, by itself, to displace the prima facie inference of negligence arising from the vehicle being
where it has no right to be for a skid may be caused by bad, careless or fast driving. The skid is thus
by itself a neutral factor and it may or may not be due to the driver's negligence. But in the instant
ease the finding of the Court below based on the earliest representation made by the claim ant in the
complaint book has not been successfully displaced on behalf of the appellant. It was, I may here
mention, for the claimant-appellant to dislodge this finding of the Tribunal by showing it to be
clearly erroneous in which attempt he does not seerrvto have succeeded.
I have, therefore, no option but to repel this contention as well."
30. Thereafter, Mr. Chhibbar. learned Senior Counsel has relied on another judgment of this Court
in the case of Mela Ram v. Mohan Singh, AIR 1978 Punj & Bar 323. In this case, it has been held that
the maxim of res ipsa loquitur can be invoked when an accident may by its nature be more
consistent with its being caused by negligence for which the respondent is responsible than by any
other causes and that in such a case the mere fact of the accident is prima facie evidence of such
negligence.
31. There is no dispute with the aforesaid propositions of law enumerated in the aforesaid decisions.
However, the principles set out above, will have to be applied to the peculiar facts of the present
case. I am of the considered opinion that there is no sufficient material on record to hold that any
reasonable inference can be drawn in the facts and circumstances of this case to establish and to say
that the robbery occurred due to the negligence on the part of the respondent-bank. The robbery in
this case, like "the skid" of the bus in Ram Pertap's case (supra), is a neutral factor. By no stretch of
imagination can it be said that the robbery could not have taken place if the lockers and the strong
room had been built according to the guidelines issued by the Indian Bankers Association and the
Reserve Bank of India. No evidence has been produced by the plaintiffs to prove that the strong
room and the lockers had not been built according to the specifications. The fact that a robbery had
taken place cannot lead to the presumption that the strong room and the lockers were not built
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1879965/ 13Atul Mehra And Anr. vs Bank Of Maharashtra on 22 March, 2002
according to specifications. Therefore, even if, bailment is held to be proved, the respondent-bank
has been correctly held to be not liable by both the learned Courts below.
32. Mr. Jagga, thereafter, proceeded to meticulously distinguish the Judgments cited by Mr.
Chhibbar which have already been noticed above. 1 have no hesitation in accepting the submissions
made by Mr. Jagga to the effect that the plaintiffs have miserably failed to prove the entrustment of
the jewellery which was allegedly kept in the locker. There is no proof of any kind to show the value
of the Jewellery which was kept in the locker, No expert witness has been produced to show that the
jewellery mentioned in the list Annexure-A to the plaint would be worth the amount claimed.
33. Consequently, I find no merit in the present appeal. The same is, therefore, dismissed with no
order as to costs.
