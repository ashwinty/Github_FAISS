THE HONBLE SRI JUSTICE A.V.SESHA SAI
C.R.P.No.3435 OF 2014
ORDER:
1. Judgment debtor in E.P.No.10 of 2011 in O.S.No.9 of 2009 on the file of the Court of the I
Additional District Judge, Karimnagar is the petitioner in the present revision filed under Section
115 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In the present revision, challenge is to the order dated 9.7.2014
passed by the said Court, directing delivery of the schedule property covered by the suit agreement
of sale.
The facts and circumstances, leading to the filing of the present revision are as infra:
2. Respondent herein instituted O.S.No.9 of 2009 against the petitioner on the file of the Court of
the I Additional District Judge, Karimnagar for specific performance of Agreement of Sale dated
12.11.2007. The learned Judge decreed the suit on 29.4.2011. Thereafter the decree
holder/respondent filed E.P.No.10 of 2011 for execution of sale deed and delivery of possession. The
Court below executed registered sale deed on 18.3.2012. In the said execution proceedings,
respondent herein filed E.A.No.1 of 2013 for delivery of the subject property. Judgment
debtor/petitioner herein filed a counter affidavit, resisting the said application. The learned Judge,
by way of an order dated 9.7.2014, allowed the said application and directed the bailiff to deliver the
possession of the subject property.
3. Calling in question the validity and the legal sustainability of the said order dated 9.7.2014, the
present revision has been filed under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
4. Heard Sri D.V.N.Acharya, learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri Nimmagadda Satyanarayana,
learned counsel for the respondent apart from perusing the material available on record.
5. Contentions/submissions of the learned counsel for the petitioner:
(1) The order impugned in the present revision is erroneous, contrary to law and
opposed to the very spirit and object of the provisions of the Specific Relief Act, 1963.
(2) In view of the provisions of Section 22 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, the order
passed by the Court below is totally one without jurisdiction. (3) In the plaint, no
relief for delivery of possession was sought nor the Court passed decree for delivery of
possession and as per Section 22(1)(a) of the Specific Relief Act, no relief was claimed
nor the proviso to Section 22 was invoked and made use of, as such, the Court below
erred in ordering delivery of property.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 2Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015
(4) Since there is no decree granted by the original Court, the executing Court grossly
erred in ordering delivery of property in execution and it is a settled law that the
executing Court cannot travel beyond the decree.
(5) The reasons assigned by the Court below in the order under revision are not in
confirmity with the ratio laid down in various authoritative pronouncements.
To bolster his submissions and contentions the learned counsel for the petitioner places reliance on
the following judgments:
(i) Adcon Electronics Pvt. Ltd., v. Daulat and another
(ii) Gloster Limited v. Bowreah Jute Mills Private Limited and other .
(iii) Durisamy and others v. V.P.Periyasamy Gounder and others .
(iv) Anwar Hasan Khan v. Mohammed Shafi and others
(v) Dipak Babaria and another v. State of Gujarat and
others
(vi) Hardeep Singh v. State of Punjab and others
6. Contentions/submissions of the learned counsel for the respondent:
(1) The order under revision is in accordance with law and there is no illegality nor
any material infirmity in the impugned order and in the absence of the same present
CRP is liable to be dismissed.
(2) In the absence of any specific clause also for recovery of possession in a decree for
specific performance of agreement of sale, the executing Court is empowered to order
delivery of property covered by suit agreement of sale.
(3) The order under challenge is in accordance with the provisions of Section 55 of
the Transfer of Property Act and Section 28 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963.
(4) The area of operation of Section 22 is completely and entirely different and the
sub-section (1)(a) of Section 22 cannot be applied for the instant case and the
respondent decree holder cannot be deprived of the fruits of the decree which has
become final.
To substantiate and strengthen his submissions and contentions, the learned counsel for the
respondent takes the support of the following decisions:
(i) Babu Lal v. M/s Hazari Lal Kishori Lal and others
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 3Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015

(iii) Smt.Suluguru Vijaya and others v. Pulumati Manjula .
(iv) Kalivarapu Lakshmi Kumari v. Burada Appalanaidu

(xi) Gyasa v. Smt.Risalo
(xii) Narayana Pillai Krishna Pillai v. Ponnuswami Chettiar Subbalekshmi Ammal
7. In above back ground now the issues, which this Court is called upon to answer in
the present revision are;
(1) Whether the learned Additional District Judge is justified in ordering delivery of the schedule
property covered by the suit agreement of sale dt.12-11-2007 ?
(2) Whether the order impugned is vitiated in view of the provisions of Section 22 of the Specific
Relief Act ?
(3) Whether the order under revision is in accordance with the provisions of Section 55 of the
Transfer of Property Act, 1882 ?
8. The provisions of law which are germane and relevant for the purpose of resolving the issues in
the present revision are Sections 22 and 28 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 and Sections 55 (1) of the
Transfer of Property Act, 1882. Sections 22 and 28 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 read as infra:
Section 22 - Power to grant relief for possession, partition, refund of earnest money,
etc (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Code of Civil
Procedure,1908, any person suing for the specific performance of a contract for the
transfer of immovable property may, in an appropriate case, ask for--
(a) possession, or partition and separate possession, of the property, in addition to
such performance; or
(b) any other relief to which he may be entitled, including the refund of any earnest
money or deposit paid or2[made by] him, in case his claim for specific performance is
refused.
(2) No relief under clause (a) or clause (b) of sub-section (1) shall be granted by the
court unless it has been specifically claimed:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 4Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015
Provident that where the plaintiff has not claimed any such relief in the plaint, the
court shall, at any stage of the proceeding, allow him to amend the plaint on such
terms as may be just for including a claim for such relief.
(3) The power of the court to grant relief under clause (b) of sub-section (1) shall be
without prejudice to its powers to award compensation under section 21.
Section 28 - Rescission in certain circumstances of contracts for the sale or lease of immovable
property, the specific performance of which has been decreed (1) Where in any suit a decree for
specific performance of a contract for the sale or lease of immovable property has been made and
the purchaser or lessee does not, within the period allowed by the decree or such further period as
the court may allow, pay the purchase money or other sum which the court has ordered him to pay,
the vendor or lessor may apply in the same suit in which the decree is made, to have the contract
rescinded and on such application the court may, by order, rescind the contract either so far as
regards the party in default or altogether, as the justice of the case may require.
(2) Where a contract is rescinded under sub-section (1), the court--
(a) shall direct the purchaser or the lessee, if he has obtained possession of the property under the
contract, to restore such possession to the vendor or lessor; and
(b) may direct payment to the vendor or lessor of all the rents and profits which have accrued in
respect of the property from the date on which possession was so obtained by the purchaser or
lessee until restoration of possession to the vendor or lessor, and if the justice of the case so
requires, the refund of any sum paid by the vendee or the lessee as earnest money or deposit in
connection with the contract.
(3) If the purchase or lessee pays the purchase money or other sum which he is ordered to pay under
the decree within the period referred to in sub-section (1), the court may, on application made in the
same suit, award the purchaser or lessee such further relief as he may be entitled to, including in
appropriate cases all or any of the following reliefs, namely:--
(a) the execution of a proper conveyance or lease by the vendor or lessor;
(b) the delivery of possession, or partition and separate possession, of the property
on the execution of such conveyance or lease.
(4) No separate suit in respect of any relief which may be claimed under this section
shall lie at the instance of a vendor, purchaser, lessor or lessee, as the case may be.
(5) The costs of any proceedings under this section shall be in the discretion of the
court.
9. Section 55 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 reads as infra:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 5Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015
Rights and liabilities of buyer and seller In the absence of a contract to the contrary,
the buyer and the seller of immoveable property respectively are subject to the
liabilities, and have the rights, mentioned in the rules next following or such of them
as are applicable to the property sold:
(1) The seller is bound-
(a) to disclose to the buyer any material defect in the property1[or in the seller's title
thereto] of which the seller is, and the buyer is not, aware, and which the buyer could
not with ordinary care discover;
(b) to produce to the buyer on his request for examination all documents of title
relating to the property which are in the seller s possession or power;
(c) to answer to the best of his information all relevant questions put to him by the
buyer in respect to the property or the title thereto;
(d) on payment or tender of the amount due in respect of the price, to execute a
proper conveyance of the property when the buyer tenders it to him for execution at a
proper time and place;
(e) between the date of the contract of sale and the delivery of the property, to take as
much care of the property and all documents of title relating thereto which are in his
possession as an owner of ordinary prudence would take of such property and
documents;
(f) to give, on being so required, the buyer, or such person as he directs, such
possession of the property as its nature admits;
(g) to pay all public charges and rent accrued due in respect of the property up to the
date of the sale, the interest on all encumbrances on such property due on such date,
and, except where the property is sold subject to encumbrances, to discharge all
encumbrances on the property then existing.
(2) The seller shall be deemed to contract with the buyer that the interest which the
seller professes to transfer to the buyer subsists and that he has power to transfer the
same:
Provided that, where the sale is made by a person in a fiduciary character, he shall be
deemed to contract with the buyer that the seller has done no act whereby the
property is encumbered or whereby he is hindered from transferring it.
The benefit of the contract mentioned in this rule shall be annexed to, and shall go
with, the interest of the transferee as such, and may be enforced by every person in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 6Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015
whom that interest is for the whole or any part thereof from time to time vested.
(3) Where the whole of the purchase-money has been paid to the seller, he is also
bound to deliver to the buyer all documents of title relating to the property which are
in the seller's possession or power:
Provided that, (a) where the seller retains any part of the property comprised in such
documents, he is entitled to retain them all, and, (b) where the whole of such
property is sold to different buyers, the buyer of the lot of greatest value is entitled to
such documents. But in case
(a) the seller, and in case (b) the buyer, of the lot of greatest value, is bound, upon
every reasonable request by the buyer, or by any of the other buyers, as the case may
be, and at the cost of the person making the request, to produce the said documents
and furnish such true copies thereof or extracts therefrom as he may require; and in
the meantime, the seller, or the buyer of the lot of greatest value, as the case may be,
shall keep the said documents safe, uncancelled and undefaced, unless prevented
from so doing by fire or other inevitable accident.
(4) The seller is entitled-
(a) to the rents and profits of the property till the ownership thereof passes to the
buyer;
(b) where the ownership of the property has passed to the buyer before payment of
the whole of the purchase-money, to a charge upon the property in the hands of the
buyer,1[any transferee without consideration or any transferee with notice of the
non-payment], for the amount of the purchase-money, or any part thereof remaining
unpaid, and for interest on such amount or part1[from the date on which possession
has been delivered].
(5) The buyer is bound-
(a) to disclose to the seller any fact as to the nature or extent of the seller's interest in
the property of which the buyer is aware, but of which he has reason to believe that
the seller is not aware, and which materially increases the value of such interest;
(b) to pay or tender, at the time and place of completing the sale, the purchase-money
to the seller or such person as he directs: provided that, where the property is sold
free from encumbrances, the buyer may retain out of the purchase-money the
amount of any encumbrances on the property existing at the date of the sale, and
shall pay the amount so retained to the persons entitled thereto;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 7Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015
(c) where the ownership of the property has passed to the buyer, to bear any loss
arising from the destruction, injury or decrease in value of the property not caused by
the seller;
(d) where the ownership of the property has passed to the buyer, as between himself
and the seller, to pay all public charges and rent which may become payable in
respect of the property, the principal moneys due on any encumbrances subject to
which the property is sold, and the interest thereon afterwards accruing due.
(6) The buyer is entitled-
(a) where the ownership of the property has passed to him, to the benefit of any
improvement in, or increase in value of, the property, and to the rents and profits
thereof;
(b) unless he has improperly declined to accept delivery of the property, to a charge
on the property, as against the seller and all persons claiming under him,2[ * * *] to
the extent of the seller's interest in the property, for the amount of any
purchase-money properly paid by the buyer in anticipation of the delivery and for
interest on such amount;
and, when he properly declines to accept the delivery, also for the earnest (if any) and for the costs
(if any) awarded to him of a suit to compel specific performance of the contract or to obtain a decree
for its rescission.
An omission to make such disclosures as are mentioned in this section, paragraph (1), clause (a) and
paragraph (5), clause (a), is fraudulent.
10. In the instant case, absolutely there is no controversy with regard to the realities that the learned
I Additional District Judge, Karimnagar decreed the suit on 29.4.2011, directing the petitioner
herein to execute registered sale deed in respect of the land covered by the suit agreement of sale
dated 12.11.2007 and that the said decree has attained finality in view of non filing of any appeal
against the said decree. The only objection of the judgment debtor is that as the decree holder did
not seek the relief of possession as stipulated under Section 22(1)(a) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963
and as there is no decree for recovery of possession, the decree holder/respondent is not entitled for
possession in execution. On the contrary it is the case of the decree holder that in view of the
provisions of Section 28 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 and Section 55(1)(f) of the Transfer of
Property Act, 1882 the objection of the petitioner/judgment debtor cannot stand for judicial
scrutiny and liable to be rejected. These aspects are required to be examined in the light of various
pronouncements of the Hon'ble Apex Court and various High Courts.
11. In Adcon Electronics Pvt. Ltd., v. Daulat (1 supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court at paragraphs 16
to 18 held as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 8Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015
16. In a suit for specific performance of contract for sale of immovable property
containing stipulation that on execution of the sale deed the possession of the
immovable property will be handed over to the purchaser, it is implied that delivery
of possession of the immovable property is part of the decree of specific performance
of contract. But in this connection it is necessary to refer to Section 22 of the Specific
Relief Act, 1963 which runs:
"22. Power to grant relief for possession, partition, refund of earnest money, etc.-
(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908, any person suing for the specific performance of a contract for the
transfer of immovable property may, in an appropriate case, ask for-
(a) possession, or partition and separate possession, of the property, in addition to
such performance; or
(b) any other relief to which he may be entitled, including the refund of any earnest
money or deposit paid or made by him in case his claim for specific performance is
refused.
(2) No relief under clause (a) or clause (b) of sub-section (1) shall be granted by the
court unless it has been specifically claimed:
Provided that where the plaintiff has not claimed any such relief in the plant, the
court shall, at any stage of the proceeding, allow him to amend the plaint on such
terms as my be just for including a claim for such relief.
17. It may be seen that sub-section (1) is an enabling provision. A plaintiff in a suit of
specific performance may ask for further reliefs mentioned in clauses (a) and (b)
thereof. Clause (a) contains relief of possession and partition and separate possession
of the property, in addition to specific performance. The mandate of sub-section (2)
Section 22 is that no relief under clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (1) shall be
granted by the Court unless it has been specifically claimed.
Thus it follows that no court can grant the relief of possession of land of other immovable property,
subject-matter of the agreement for sale in regard to which specific performance is claimed, unless
the possession of the immovable property is specifically prayed for.
18. In the instant case the suit is for specific performance of agreement for sale of the suit property
wherein relief of delivery of the suit property has not been specifically claimed as such it cannot be
treated as a "suit for land".
12. In Gloster Limited v. Bowreah Jute Mills Private Limited (2 supra), a Division Bench of the
Calcutta High Court following the judgment of Apex Court in Adcon Electronics Pvt. Ltd. v. Daulat
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 9Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015
(1 supra), at paras 21 and 22 held thus:
21. We have considered the rival contentions of the parties. A 'suit for land' is
essentially a suit which involves direct adjudication of title and/or possession in
respect of land or other immovable property. If a decree or order passed in a suit
indirectly and/or consequentially affects title to and or possession in respect of land,
the suit cannot be said to be a 'suit for land'. A suit for specific performance of a
contract for sale of immovable property without any prayer for possession has been
held to be not a 'suit for land' by our Apex Court in Adcon Electronics Pvt.
Ltd. (supra), although the decree in the suit may indirectly affect title to the concerned immovable
property. By reverse analogy a suit for delivery up and cancellation of an agreement relating to
immovable property without any prayer for possession should also not be a 'suit for land' even
though the decree in the suit may indirectly or consequentially affect title or possession to land. The
Division Bench decision of this Court in the case of Debendra Nath Chowdhury (supra) also lends
support to this view.
22. In view of the aforesaid, with the deepest regard we have for the learned Judge, we are unable to
agree with His Lordship that in spite of plaintiff/appellant having given up prayers (b) and (c) of the
plaint, prayer (a) of the plaint would still make the suit a 'suit for land'. The appeal succeeds. The
judgment and order impugned is set aside. The plaintiff will be at liberty to proceed with its suit
shorn of prayers (b) and (c) of the plaint. The cross-objection filed by the defendant no. 2 has not
been seriously pressed. In any event, we do not find any merit in the grounds enumerated in the
cross-objection. The cross-objection fails and is dismissed. In the facts and circumstances of the
case there will be no order as to costs.
13. In Durisamy v. V.P.Periyasamy Gounder (3 supra), the Madras High Court at paragraphs 13, 15
& 16 held as under:
13. The other contention of the learned counsel for the revision petitioners would be
that the Hon'ble Apex Court in its judgment reported in AIR 2001 SC 3712 =
2002-1-L.W. 368 in between Adcon Electronics Pvt. Ltd. v. Daulat has categorically
laid down that the plaintiffs in the suit for specific performance cannot seek for
possession when they failed to pray for the relief of possession in the suit. The
relevant passage relied upon by the learned counsel for the revision petitioner would
run as follows:
17. It may be seen that sub-section (1) is an enabling provision.
A plaintiff in a suit of specific performance may ask for further reliefs mentioned in clauses (a) and
(b) thereof. Clause (a) contains reliefs of possession and partition and separate possession of the
property, in addition to specific performance. The mandate of sub-section (2) of Section 22 is that
no relief under clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (1) shall be granted by the court unless it has been
specifically claimed. Thus it follows that no court can grant the relief of possession of land or other
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 10Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015
immovable property, subject-matter of the agreement for sale in regard to which specific
performance is claimed, unless the possession of the immovable property is specifically prayed for.
In the said dictum, it has been categorically laid down that the relief of possession of a land or other
immovable property, subject matter of the agreement for sale in a suit for specific performance
cannot be claimed or granted by the Court unless the possession of such immovable property was
specifically prayed for. It has been further found by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the said judgment
that the suit filed by the plaintiffs was not a suit for land, since possession was not asked for in the
said suit. It has been categorically found by the Hon'ble Apex Court that the suit for specific
performance in simplicitor is not a suit for land under the meaning of Clause 12 of the Letters Patent
and thus, it has been found that the suit for specific performance of a contract for sale of immovable
property was found to be a suit on a personal contract in between parties. The reliance placed by the
learned counsel for the plaintiffs reported in AIR 2001 SC 3712 = 2002-1-L.W. 368 cited supra was
applicable only in the appropriate cases which were mentioned in Section 22 of the Act and,
therefore, it was found that the relief of possession should have been asked for in the plaint by the
plaintiffs. He would submit that so far as the present case on hand is concerned, it is not attracted
under the cases mentioned in Section 22 and hence, the said dictum is not applicable. The further
contention is that the ruling given in the judgment reported in AIR 1982 SC 818 = (1982) 95 L.W.
106 S.N. in between Babu Lal Vs. M/s, Hazari Lal Kishori Lal alone is applicable since the present
case is not coming under the definition of an appropriate case. The relevant passage which was
relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondents/plaintiffs in the said judgment would be as
follows:
13. The expression in sub-section (1) of Section 22 "in an appropriate case" is very
significant. The plaintiff may ask for the relief of possession or partition or separate
possession "in an appropriate case". As pointed out earlier, in view of Order 2 Rule 2
of the Code of Civil Procedure, some doubt was entertained whether the relief for
specific performance and partition and possession could be combined in one suit;
one view being that the cause of action for claiming relief for partition and possession
could accrue to the plaintiff only after he acquired title to the property on the
execution of a sale deed in his favour and since the relief for specific performance of
the contract for sale was not based on the same cause of action as the relief for
partition and possession, the two reliefs could not be combined in one suit.
Similarly, a case may be visualised where after the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant
the property passed in possession of a third person. A mere relief for specific performance of the
contract of sale may not entitle the plaintiff to obtain possession as against the party in actual
possession of the property. As against him, a decree for possession must be specifically claimed or
such a person is not bound by the contract sought to be enforced. In a case where exclusive
possession is with the contracting party, a decree for specific performance of the contract of sale
simplicitor, without specifically providing for delivery of possession, may give complete relief to the
decree- holder. In order to satisfy the decree against him completely he is bound not only to execute
the sale deed but also to put the property in possession of the decree-holder. This is in consonance
with the provisions of Section 55(1) of the Transfer of Property Act which provides that the seller is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 11Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015
bound to give, on being so required, the buyer or such person as he directs, such possession of the
property as its nature admits.
16. It may be pointed out that the Additional Civil Judge had decreed the suit for specific
performance of the contract. The High Court modified the decree to the extent that the sale deed
was to be executed by respondents Nos. 6 to 9 together with petitioner. In short, the decree was
passed by the High Court not only against respondents Nos. 6 to 9 but also against the subsequent
purchaser i.e., the petitioner and thus the petitioner was himself the judgment -debtor and it cannot
be said that he was a third person in possession and, therefore, relief for possession must be
claimed. The contention on behalf of the petitioner is that the relief for possession must be claimed
in a suit for specific performance of a contract in all cases. This argument ignores the significance of
the words 'in an appropriate case'. The expression only indicates that it is not always incumbent on
the plaintiff to claim possession or partition or separate possession in a suit for specific performance
of a contract for the transfer of the immoveable property. That has to be done where the
circumstances demanding the relief for specific performance of the contract of sale embraced within
its ambit not only the execution of the sale deed but also possession over the property conveyed
under the sale deed. It may not always be necessary for the plaintiff to specifically claim possession
over the property, the relief of possession being inherent in the relief for specific performance of the
contract of sale. Besides, the proviso to sub-sec(2) of S. 22 provides for amendment of the plaint on
such terms as may be just for including a claim for such relief 'at any stage of the proceedings.
14. .
15. The petitioners cannot have any say in amending the plaint as well as the decree which was
passed against the defendants. Therefore, they have no locus standi to object if the
respondents/plaintiffs are asking for any amendment in the plaint as well as in the decree.
Therefore, while relying upon the dictum rendered in 2006 2 MLJ 350 in between N.K. Jinnah Vs.
K.P. Krishnan, the lower Court should permit the respondents/ plaintiffs to amend the plaint as well
as the decree including the prayer for possession of the said property in accordance with the
judgments of Hon'ble Apex Court made in AIR 1982 SC 818 = (1982) 95 L.W. 106 S.N. and 2001
AIR SC 3712 = 2002-1-L.W. 368 cited supra. Therefore, this Court finds that the order passed by the
lower Court is liable to be interfered with, but with certain directions. Since the procedure as
contemplated under Section 22 of the Act is meant to advance the cause of justice and it is only an
enabling provision in order to avoid multiplicity of proceedings, it has become necessary for this
Court to direct the respondents/plaintiffs to amend the plaint in order to add the relief for
possession as contemplated in the provisions of Section 22 of the Act and shall the decree shall also
consequentially be amended and thereafter to claim delivery of possession against the judgment
debtors. It has been categorically mentioned in the said judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in para 20,
that the amending the plaint can be done at any stage which includes the stage of execution.
16. Therefore, this Court is inclined to interfere with the order passed by the lower Court and set
aside the same with a direction to permit the respondents/plaintiffs to amend the plaint and, the
decree for the relief of possession, and thereafter, to continue the execution petition filed by the
respondents/ plaintiffs, in view of the long period lapsed due to the pendency of proceedings. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 12Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015
lower Court is also directed to keep the execution proceedings pending awaiting the amendment of
the plaint as well as the decree and after receiving the amended decree, to continue the said
proceedings and to pass suitable orders thereon. With the aforesaid directions, the order passed by
the lower Court is set aside and the Civil Revision Petition is ordered accordingly. No costs.
Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed.
14. In Anwar Hasan Khan v. Mohammed Shafi (4 supra), the Hon'ble Apex Court at paragraph 8
held as under:
8. It is settled that for interpreting a particular provision of an Act, the import and
effect of the meaning of the words and phrases used in the statute has to be gathered
from the text, the nature of the subject matter and the purpose and intention of the
statute. It is cardinal principle of construction of a statute that effort should be made
in construing its provisions by avoiding the conflict and adopting a harmonious
construction. The statute or rules made thereunder should be read as a whole and
one provision should be construed with reference to the other provision to make the
provision consistent with the object sought to be achieved. The well-known principle
of harmonious construction is that effect should be given to all the provisions and a
construction that reduces one of the provision to a "dead letter" is not harmonious
construction. With respect to law relating to interpretation of statute this Court in
Union of India & Ors. v. Filip Tiago De Gama of Vedem Vasco De Gama
(1990)1SCC277 held:
The paramount object in statutory interpretation is to discover what the legislature
intended. This intention is primarily to be ascertained from the text of enactment in
question. That does not mean the text is to be construed merely as a piece of prose,
without reference to its nature or purpose. A statute is neither a literary text nor a
divine revelation. "Words are certainly not crystals, transparent and unchanged" as
Mr. Justice Holmes was wisely and properly warned (Towne v. Eisner(1918) 245 US
418 learned (sic)and, J., was equally emphatic when he said" :
"Statutes should be construed, not as theorems of Euclid, but with some imagination
of the purpose which lie behind them."
(Lenigh Valley Coal co. V. Yensavage 218 FR 547.
15. In Dipak Babaria v. State of Gujarat (5 supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court at paragraph 53 held
as under:
53. It is well settled that where the statute provides for a thing to be done in a
particular manner, then it has to be done in that manner and in no other manner.
This proposition of law laid down in Taylor v.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 13Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015
Taylor (1875) 1 Ch D 426, 431 was first adopted by the Judicial Committee in Nazir Ahmed v. King
Emperor reported in AIR 1936 PC 253 and then followed by a bench of three Judges of this Court in
Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh v. State of Vindhya Pradesh reported in AIR 1954 SC 322. This proposition
was further explained in paragraph 8 of State of U.P. v. Singhara Singh by a bench of three Judges
reported in AIR 1964 SC 358 in the following words:
8. The rule adopted in Taylor v. Taylor is well recognised and is founded on sound
principle. Its result is that if a statute has conferred a power to do an act and has laid
down the method in which that power has to be exercised, it necessarily prohibits the
doing of the act in any other manner than that which has been prescribed. The
principle behind the rule is that if this were not so, the statutory provision might as
well not have been enacted....
This proposition has been later on reiterated in Chandra Kishore Jha v. Mahavir Prasad reported in
1999 (8) SCC 266,Dhananjaya Reddy v. State of Karnataka reported in 2001 (4) SCC 9 and Gujarat
Urja Vikas Nigam Limited v. Essar Power Limited reported in 2008 (4) SCC 755.
16. In Hardeep Singh v. State of Punjab (6 supra), the Hon'ble Apex Court at paragraphs 40 and 41
held as under:
40. The court cannot proceed with an assumption that the legislature enacting the
statute has committed a mistake and where the language of the statute is plain and
unambiguous, the court cannot go behind the language of the statute so as to add or
subtract a word playing the role of a political reformer or of a wise counsel to the
legislature. The court has to proceed on the footing that the legislature intended what
it has said and even if there is some defect in the phraseology etc., it is for others than
the court to remedy that defect. The statute requires to be interpreted without doing
any violence to the language used therein.
The court cannot re-write, recast or reframe the legislation for the reason that it has no power to
legislate.
41. No word in a statute has to be construed as surplusage. No word can be rendered ineffective or
purposeless. Courts are required to carry out the legislative intent fully and completely. While
construing a provision, full effect is to be given to the language used therein, giving reference to the
context and other provisions of the Statute. By construction, a provision should not be reduced to a
"dead letter" or "useless lumber". An interpretation which renders a provision an otiose should be
avoided otherwise it would mean that in enacting such a provision, the legislature was involved in
"an exercise in futility" and the product came as a "purposeless piece" of legislation and that the
provision had been enacted without any purpose and the entire exercise to enact such a provision
was "most unwarranted besides being uncharitable." (Vide: Patel Chunibhai Dajibha etc. v.
Narayanrao Khanderao Jambekar and Anr. : AIR 1965 SC 1457; The Martin Burn Ltd. v. The
Corporation of Calcutta: AIR 1966 SC 529; M.V. Elisabeth and Ors. v. Harwan Investment and

Coming to the judgments cited by the learned counsel for the respondent/decree holder
17. In Babu Lal v. M/s Hazari Lal Kishori Lal (7 supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court at paras 11 to 16,
26 & 29 held as under:
11. Section 22 enacts a rule of pleading. The Legislature thought it will be useful to
introduce a rule that in order to avoid multiplicity of proceedings the plaintiff may
claim a decree for possession in a suit for specific performance, even though strictly
speaking, the right to possession accrues only when suit for specific performance is
decreed.
The Legislature has now made a statutory provision enabling the plaintiff to ask for possession in
the suit for specific performance and empowering the court to provide in the decree itself that upon
payment by the plaintiff of the consideration money within the given time, the defendant should
execute the deed and put the plaintiff in possession.
12. The section enacts that a person in a suit for specific performance of a contract for the transfer of
immovable property, may ask for appropriate reliefs, namely, he may ask for possession, or for
partition, or for separate possession including the relief for specific performance. These reliefs he
can claim, not-with standing anything contained in the CPC, 1908, to the contrary. Sub-section (2)
of this section, however, specifically provides that these reliefs cannot be granted by the Court,
unless they have been expressly claimed by the plaintiff in the suit. Sub-section (2) of the section
recognised in clear terms the well- established rule of procedure that the court should not entertain
a claim of the plaintiff unless it has been specifically pleaded by the plaintiff and proved by him to be
legally entitled to. The proviso to this Sub-section (2), however, says that where the plaintiff has not
specifically claimed these reliefs in his plaint, in the initial stage of the suit, the court shall permit
the plaintiff at any stage of the proceedings, to include one or more of the reliefs, mentioned above
by means of an amendment of the plaint on such terms as it may deem proper. The only purpose of
this newly enacted provision is to avoid multiplicity of suits and that the plaintiff may get
appropriate relief without being hampered by procedural complications.
13. The expression in-Sub-section (1) of Section 22 'in an appropriate case' is very significant, The
plaintiff may ask for the relief of possession or partition of Separate possession 'in an appropriate
case'. As pointed out earlier; in view of Order 2, Rule 2 of the CPC, some doubt was entertained
whether the relief for specific performance and partition, and possession could be combined in one
suit; one view being that the cause of action for claiming relief for partition and possession could
accrue to the plaintiff only after he acquired title to the property on the execution of a sale deed in
his favour and since the relief for specific performance of the contract for sale was not based on the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 15Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015
same cause of action as the relief for partition and possession, the two reliefs could not be combined
in one suit. Similarly, as a case may be visualized where after the contract between the plaintiff and
the defendant the property passed in possession of a third, person. A mere relief for specific
performance of the contract of sale may not entitle the plaintiff to obtain possession as against the
party in actual possession of the property. As against him, a decree for possession must be
specifically claimed or such a person is not bound by the contract sought to be enforced. In a case
where exclusive possession is with the contracting party, a decree for specific performance of the
contract of sale simpliciter without specifically providing for delivery of possession, may give
complete relief to the decree-holder. In order to satisfy the decree against him completely he is
bound not only to execute the sale- deed but also to put the property in possession of the decree
holder. This is no consonance with the provision of Section 55(1) of the Transfer of Property Act
which provides that the seller is bound to give, on being so required, the buyer or such person as he
directs, such possession of the property as its nature admits.
14. There may be circumstances in which a relief for possession cannot be effectively granted to the
decree-holder without specifically claiming relief for possession, viz., where the property agreed to
be conveyed is jointly held by the defendant with other persons. In such a case the plaintiff in order
to obtain complete and effective relief must claim partition of the property and possession over the
share of the defendant. It is in such cases that a relief for possession must be specifically pleaded.
15. In the instant case, it is pointed out on behalf of the petitioner that the possession was not with
the respondents Nos. 6 to 9 but was with a third person namely, the petitioner, who was subsequent
purchaser and, therefore, this was an appropriate case where the relief for possession should have
been claimed by the plaintiff-respondents Nos. 1 to 5.
16. It may be pointed out that the Additional Civil Judge had decreed the suit for specific
performance of the contract. The High Court modified decree to the extent that the sale deed was to
be executed by respondents Nos. 6 to 9 together with the petitioner. In short, the decree was passed
by the High Court not only against respondents Nos. 6 to 9 but also against the subsequent
purchaser i.e., the petitioner and thus the petitioner was himself the judgment-debtor and it cannot
be said that he was a third person in possession and, therefore, relief for possession must be
claimed. The contention on behalf of the petitioner is that the relief for possession must be claimed
in a suit for specific performance of a contract in all cases. This argument ignores the significance of
the words 'in an appropriate case'. The expression only indicates that it is not always incumbent on
the plaintiff to claim possession or partition or separate possession in a suit for specific performance
of a contract for the transfer of the immovable property. That has to be done where the
circumstances demanding the relief for specific performance of the contract of sale embraced within
its ambit not only the execution of the sale deed but also possession over the property conveyed
under the sale deed. It may not always be necessary for the plaintiff to specifically claim possession
over the property, the relief of possession being inherent in the relief for specific performance of the
contract of sale. Besides, the proviso to Sub-section (2) of Section 22 provides for amendment of the
plaint on such terms as may be just for including a claim for such relief 'at any stage of the
proceedings'.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 16Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015
26. Sub-section (3) of Section 28 clearly contemplates that if the purchaser or lessee pays the
purchase money or other sum which he is ordered to pay under the decree, the Court may on
application made in the same suit, award the purchaser or lessee such further relief as he may be
entitled to. Sub-clause (b) of Sub-section (3) of Section 28 contemplates the delivery of possession
or partition and separate possession of the property on the execution of such conveyance or lease.
Sub-section (4) of Section 28 bars the filing of a separate suit for any relief which may be claimed
under this section.
29. Procedure is meant to advance the cause of justice and not to retard it. The difficulty of the
decree-holder starts in getting possession in pursuance of the decree obtained by him. The
judgment-debtor tries to thwart the execution by all possible objections. In the circumstances
narrated above, we do not find any fault with the order passed by the High Court.
18. In Nakshtrapum Venkateswarlu v. Smt. Bathula Ankamma (8 supra), a learned single Judge of
this Court followed the judgment of the Honble Apex Court in Babu Lal v. M/s Hazari Lal Kishori
Lal (7 supra).
19. In Smt.Suluguru Vijaya v. Pulumati Manjula (9 supra), relying upon the judgment of the Honble
Apex Court in Babu Lal v. M/s Hazari Lal Kishori Lal (7 supra) and after elaborately considering the
issue in the light of the provisions of Section 28 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 and Section 55 of the
Transfer of Property Act, 1882, this Court at paras 9 & 10 held as infra:
9. The decision of the Apex Court in Adcon Electronics Pvt. Ltd. v.
Daulat and Anr. cited supra was relied on wherein the Apex Court held that Section 22(1) of Specific
Relief Act, 1963, is an enabling provision and the relief of possession can be granted only if
specifically prayed for, and hence, simpliciter for specific performance of a contract for sale of land
is a suit for enforcement of the terms of the contract and cannot be treated as a "suit for land" and
title to the land concerned is not subject-matter of a suit for specific performance. On a careful
analysis, the facts of this decision appear to be distinguishable. In S.S. Rajabathar v. N.A. Sayeed it
was held that where a suit for specific performance of a contract of sale had been decreed, the
executing Court while executing the decree, can direct delivery of possession in the absence of a
specific direction to that effect in the decree. The view expressed in Brij Mohan Matulal v. Mt.
Chandrabhagabai was dissented from. In Mahender Nath Gupta v. Moti Ram Rattan Chand and
Anr. the learned Judge of the Delhi High Court while dealing with the suit for specific performance
of contract of sale which was filed before the commencement of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, and
decree made after the commencement of the said Act, relief of delivery of possession neither claimed
in the plaint nor granted in the decree and whether executing Court can grant delivery of possession,
after referring to AIR 1967 SC 1541 : AIR 1954 All 643 : AIR 1952 Cal 362 : AIR 1950 All 415, held in
the affirmative mainly on the ground that Section 22 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, indicates a rule
of pleading. In Lotu Bandu Sonavane v. Pundalik Nimba Koli. Section 22(1) and Section 22(2)
Proviso of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 had been dealt with. The expression "in an appropriate case"
in Section 22(1) and "at any stage of the proceeding" in proviso to Section 22(2) it was held that
decree directing specific performance of agreement of sale against defendant in possession of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 17Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015
property specific prayer for delivery of possession is not necessary. In Hemchand v. Karilal : AIR
1987 Raj 117 it was held that in a suit for specific performance, property in possession of contracting
party and no third party had intervened, relief of possession would be implied in decree for specific
performance and need not be specifically asked for and the question of amendment of plaint does
not arise. Reliance also was placed on a decision in V. Narasimha Chary v. P. Radha Bai and Ors.
10. In the light of the statutory duties and obligations cast on the seller by virtue of Section 55 of the
Transfer of Property Act, 1882, and also in the light of the scope and ambit of Section 22 of the
Specific Relief Act, 1963, this Court is of the considered opinion that when there is no dispute or
controversy that the judgment debtors-defendants are in possession of the property, the mere fact
that such specific prayer was not made, the same cannot be taken advantage of principally for the
reason the decree for execution of sale deed would imply the decree of delivery of possession too
inasmuch as these are the obligations which would flow from the relief relating to execution of the
sale deed. Hence, this omission cannot be taken advantage of. It is pertinent to note that it is
nobody's case that any third party rights had intervened. When that being so, this Court is of the
considered opinion that the impugned order does not suffer from any illegality, whatsoever.
20. In Kalivarapu Lakshmi Kumari v. Burada Appalanaidu (10 supra), this Court at paragraph 6
held as under:
6. In Major S.S. Khanna (supra), the Supreme Court held that the High Court is not
obliged to exercise its jurisdiction when the case is decided by a subordinate Court
merely because exercise of the jurisdiction is discretionary, which depends upon
several factors including the general equities of the case being served by the order
impugned, which is the subject matter of challenge before it.
On the admitted facts of this case, the decree granted in favour of the Respondent having become
final and the Petitioner has lost the litigation all through, wherein he has suffered the decree for
specific performance of contract, the technical plea raised by the Petitioner placing reliance on
Explanations v. and VII to Section 11 Code of Civil Procedure, if accepted, will lead to an iniquitous
situation, where the Respondent will be left in a position of having succeeded in the civil litigation
fought for over years and still being deprived of the fruits of the decree. As held by the Supreme
Court in both the above cases, equitable jurisdiction cannot be extended to the Petitioner, more so,
when he has failed to raise the above grounds in a substantive petition filed for dismissing the
execution petition. Further, where law is on one side, and equity and justice on the other, the Court
which exercises the discretionary jurisdiction always leans in favour of the latter, lest injustice will
be perpetrated on those in whose favour equity and justice lie.
21. In V.Narasimha Chary v. P.Radha Bai (11 supra), this Court at paragraph 6 held as under:
6. The other contention of the learned Counsel for the revision petitioner is that from
the facts in Harikishan v. Balakishan Panwar (supra) it is seen that there was a clause
in the decree for delivery of possession and since there is no such clause for delivery
of possession in this case, that case is distinguishable. I am not able to agree with the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 18Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015
said contention. The Supreme Court in Babu Lal v. Hazarilal and Ors.
(supra) held that the relief of possession could be given to the decree holder even though the same is
not specifically granted in the decree. In paragraph No. 17 it is held that:
"The word 'proceeding' is not defined in the Act. Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines it
as "carrying on of an action at law, a legal action or process; any act done by authority
of a Court of law; any step taken in a cause by either party". The term 'proceeding' is a
very comprehensive term and generally speaking means a prescribed course of action
for enforcing a legal right. It is not a technical expression with a definite meaning
attached to it, but one the ambit of whose meaning will be governed by the statute. It
indicates a prescribed mode in which judicial business is conducted. The word
'proceeding' in Section 22 includes execution proceedings also."
In view of the above, though the relief of possession is not claimed in the suit, and was not granted
in the decree, the executing Court can grant the relief of possession to the decree holder in execution
proceedings also. In view thereof, I am of the opinion that the trial Court has not committed any
error and has not acted beyond its jurisdiction in granting the relief of possession in favour of the
decree holder, for this Court to interfere in Revision Under Section 115 C.P.C. In the circumstances
of the case, I need not consider the other decision cited at the bar, referred to above.
22. In Lotu Bandu Sonavane v. Pundalik Nimba Koli (14 supra), the Bombay High Court at paras 6,
7 & 10 held thus:
6. This view finds support in the above referred decision of the Kerala High Court in
Narayan Pillai's case : AIR1978Ker236. In that case relying on the decision in Gyasa
v. Risao : AIR1977All156 the learned single Judge interpreted the expression in an
appropriate case appearing in opening clause of sub-sec. (1) of S. 22 of the Specific
Relief Act, 1963 and held that the said expression indicates that it is not always
incumbent on the plaintiff to claim possession or partition and separate possession in
a suit for specific performance of the contract for transfer of immovable property.
7. Admittedly the respondent in this case is in possession of the property, which is
subject-matter of the decree for specific performance and is hound to deliver
possession of the property after execution of the sale-deed. Hence even though no
specific prayer is made in the plaint and even though the decree is silent about
delivery of possession, the executing Court was bound to grant the relief.
10. In this view of the matter the application filed by the petitioner for amendment of
the plaint will have to be granted, even though such an amendment was not
necessary.
23. In Debabrata Tarafder v. Biraj Mohan Bardhan (15 supra), the Calcutta High Court followed the
judgment of the Honble Apex Court in Babu Lal v. M/s Hazari Lal Kishori Lal (7 supra).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 19Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015
24. In S.S.Rajabathar v. N.A. Sayeed (16 supra), at paras 9, 14 & 15, the Madras High Court held as
under:
9. The next decision is that of the same High Court in Atal Behari Acharya v. Barada
Prasad Banjerji : AIR1931Pat179 . In that case the question actually arose with regard
to the jurisdiction of the executing court with reference to a decree for specific
performance of a contract of sale. The learned Judges have held that incidental to the
relief to which a plaintiff is entitled in a decree for specific performance arising on a
contract for sale, the court has a right to grant possession of the property; that a
contract for sale includes not only the execution of the necessary document but also
putting the vendee in possession of the property; and that therefore if there is an
omission in the plaint or in the decree about possession, the executing court is not
debarred from granting the plaintiff the possession of the property. Unfortunately,
while coming to this conclusion, the learned Judges mistook the decision of this court
in ILR (1914) Mad 698 = AIR 1914 Mad 465. I have already referred to the fact that
that decision was concerned only with the bar imposed by Order II Rule 2, Civil
Procedure Code and was not concerned with the jurisdiction of the executing court.
Erroneously thinking that that judgment denied the jurisdiction to the executing
court to grant relief of possession, the learned Judges of the Patna High Court stated
that in so far as that decision held that the executing court had no right to delivery
possession to a decree-holder in an action for specific performance, that proposition
had been expressly dissented from by the Patna High Court in AIR 1920 Pat 89
referred to already.
Thus, it will be seen that both the Benches of the Patna High Court in the two decisions referred to
above would appear to have mistaken the scope of the decision of this court in ILR (1914) Mad 698
= AIR 1914 Mad 465. Notwithstanding this mistake with regard to the scope of the decision of this
court, the learned Judges of the Patna High Court, if I may say so with respect, came to the correct
conclusion that an executing court had jurisdiction to grant or order delivery of possession in
execution of a decree for specific performance. One of the reasons given by the learned Judges is
that under Section 55 of the Transfer of Property Act, one of the implied conditions of a contract for
sale of immovable property is to give, on being so required, the buyer or such person as he directs
such possession of the property as its nature admits. Consequently, when the executing court directs
delivery of possession after a conveyance has been executed, it is merely completing the decree for
specific performance by directing the vendor to perform one of the obligations which he has
undertaken to perform and which law imposes on him.
14. The same view was reiterated by another Bench of that court in Pt. Balmukund v. Veerchand :
AIR1954All643 . In that case, the Bench went a step further and held that where a decree for specific
performance of a contract of sale is silent as to the relief of delivery of possession, even though
claimed in the suit, the executing court is still competent to deliver possession. The learned Judges
have pointed out that it is not necessary in a suit for specific performance either to separately claim
possession or for the court to pass a decree for possession and that a decree for specific performance
of a contract includes everything incidental to be done by one party or another to complete the sale
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 20Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015
transaction, the rights and obligations of the parties in such a matter being indicated by Section 55
of the Transfer of Property Act. According to the learned Judges-
"The decree for specific performance, which provides that the property shall be sold
to the plaintiff by the defendants and the sale deed shall be executed within a certain
time, failing which the court will have the sale be executed within a certain time,
failing which the court will have the sale deed executed by a person nominated by it,
implies that delivery of possession shall be given in accordance with the provisions of
Section 55(1)(f) of the Transfer of Property Act. Delivery of possession is a necessary
ingredient and part of transfer of ownership."
The same is the view of the Calcutta High Court also. In Kartik Chandra Pal v. Dibakar
Bhattacharjee: AIR1952Cal362 , a Bench of that High Court held-
"It is incontestable that in a suit for specific performance of contract for the sale of
land it is open to the plaintiff to join the same suit two prayers, one for the execution
of the deed of transfer and another for recovery of possession of the land in
question....... The right to recover possession springs out of the contract which is
being specifically enforced and not on the narrower view expressed in some of the
cases that it was only as a result of the execution a right arises...... The usual form of a
decree in a suit for specific performance is that the agreement is referred to be
specifically performed and carried into execution with a further provision about the
details of the steps to be taken by the parties. The most important part of the decree
is that portion where the court directs the contract to be specifically performed. The
details which follow do not in any way limit the jurisdiction of the executing court to
the particular steps which are mentioned in the decree but all such other steps which
ought to be taken for giving full effect to the decree for specific performance are not
only within the competence of the court but the court is bound to assist the party to
that extent........ By the decree for specific performance the court sets out that it finds
to be the real contract between the parties and declares that such a contract exists
and it is for the executing court to do the rest."
15. The same view was reiterated by another Bench of that court in Subodh Kumar Banerjee v.
Hirmani Dasi : AIR1955Cal267 . The learned Judges held-
"Thus unless there is a contract to the contrary, giving delivery of possession to the
buyer by the seller is an incident of a contract for sale and when there is a decree
directing the contract to be specifically performed it includes a direction upon the
vendor to give delivery of possession to the purchasers."
The same view was taken by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh in Dadulal Hanumanlala v. Deo
Kunwar Bai: AIR1963MP86 . The learned Judge held in that case-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 21Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015
"Under Section 55 of the Transfer of Property Act the rights and liabilities of buyer
and seller, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, have been enumerated and, as
the contract in question (Ex. Para-1) is silent and there being nothing to the contrary
as to the delivery of possession, it has to be held that the vendor- defendants had
contracted with the plaintiff-vendee to deliver possession to him over the property
after execution of the sale deed in his favour. It was a part of the entire contract and
that come into existence simultaneously with that when the plaintiff went to the court
claiming specific performance of the contract (Ex. P-1) and was declared to be so
entitled, the defendant- judgment-debtors would be deemed to have been held also
correspondingly liable not only to covey the property but also to place the
plaintiff-decree-holder in possession thereof on being so required by him."
25. In Gyasa v. Smt.Risalo (17 supra), at paragraphs 3 to 6, it was held as under:
3. It was contended that in a suit for specific performance of contract for the sale of
immovable property, the plaintiff must always claim possession or partition or
separate possession of the property in addition to the relief for specific performance
of contract and where the plaintiff omits to do so specifically no such relief could be
granted by the Court. Since the Court is precluded from granting the relief for
possession in a suit where relief for possession has not been specifically claimed, it is
not competent for the execution Court to deliver possession of the property to the
decree-holder in execution of a decree for mere specific performance of the contract
of sale of the immovable property. This argument ignores the significance of the
words 'in an appropriate case' occurring in Sub-section (1). The expression 'in an
appropriate case' indicates that it is not always incumbent on the plaintiff to claim
possession or partition or separate possession in a suit for specific performance of
contract for the transfer of the Immovable property. That is to be done where the
circumstances demand it. The relief for specific performance of the contract of sale
embraces within its ambit not only the execution of the sale deed but also possession
over the property conveyed under the sale deed. It may not always be necessary for
the plaintiff to specifically claim possession over the property, the relief for
possession being inherent in the relief for specific performance of the contract for
sale. It cannot, however, be disputed that in certain circumstances relief of possession
cannot be effectively granted to the decree-holder without specifically claiming relief
for possession e.g., where the property agreed to be conveyed is jointly held by the
defendant with other persons. In such a case the plaintiff in order to obtain complete
and effective relief must claim partition of the property and possession over the share
of the defendant. Earlier in view of Order 2, Rule 2, Civil Procedure Code, some
doubt was entertained whether the relief for specific performance and partition and
possession could be combined in one suit, one view being that the cause of action for
claiming relief for partition and possession could accrue to the plaintiff only after he
acquired title to the property on the execution of a sale deed in his favour and since
the relief for specific performance of the contract for sale was not based on the same
cause of action as the relief for partition and possession, the two reliefs could not be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 22Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015
combined in one suit Similarly a case may be visualised where after the contract
between the plaintiff and the defendant the property passed in possession of a third
person. A mere relief for specific performance of the contract of sale may not entitle
the plaintiff to obtain possession as against the party in actual possession of the
property. As against him a decree for possession must be specifically claimed for such
a person is not bound by the contract sought to be enforced. It appears that Section
22 of the Specific Relief Act was enacted to get over such technical difficulties and to
avoid multiplicity of suits. In a case where exclusive possession is with the
contracting party, a decree for specific, performance of the contract of sale
simpliciter, without specifically providing for delivery of possession, may give
complete relief to the decree-holder. In order to satisfy the decree against him
completely he is bound not only to execute the sale deed but also to put the property
in possession of the decree holder.
This is in consonance with the provisions of Section 55(1)(f) of the Transfer of Property Act which
provides that the seller is bound to give, on being, so required, the buyer or such person as he
directs, such possession of the property as its nature admits.
4. The principle that the relief for possession is inherent in the relief for specific performance of the
contract of sale and that in execution of a decree for specific performance of a contract of sale the
decree holder is entitled to possession over the property even if no such relief was specifically
claimed in the suit or granted under the decree, was accepted by this Court in Arjun Singh v. Sahu
Maharaj Narain :
AIR1950All415 . The Court observed :--
"The nature of the relief granted by the decree in a suit for specific performance of a
contract for sale is such that everything which is necessary for the contract to be
specifically performed should be held to be comprised in it. A contract for sale
includes not only the execution of the sale deed as required by the Transfer of
Property Act, but also putting the vendee in possession of the property sold. As soon
as the deed of conveyance is executed the title to the property in question vests in the
vendee. The delivery of possession by the execution Court, therefore, appears to be
some thing incidental to the right of the decree-holder to have the contract
specifically performed. "The deed of conveyance is itself executed by the execution
Court. An order directing delivery of possession to the vendee is merely incidental to
the execution of the deed of sale."
This principle was reiterated by a Bench of this Court in Balmukund v. Veer Chand : AIR1954All643
.
5. It was contended that the principle laid down in the aforesaid cases no longer holds good in view
of the specific provision contained in Section 22 of the Specific Relief Act. As observed earlier this
argument ignores the expression 'in an appropriate case' contained in Sub-section (1) of Section 22
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 23Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015
of the Specific Relief Act, The use of the word 'may' in Sub-section (1) also indicates that it is not
always incumbent on such a plaintiff to claim specifically relief for possession or partition or
separate possession. The principle enunciated in the aforesaid cases is not shaken by Section 22 and
still holds good.
6. In the present case, the property being in possession of the judgment-debtor, there is no hurdle in
satisfying the decree by putting the decree-holder in possession over it through execution of the
decree as it stands. The objection of the judgment-debtor to the executability of the decree by
delivery of possession is untenable.
26. In Narayana Pillai Krishna Pillai v. Ponnuswami Chettiar Subbalekshmi Ammal (18 supra), at
paragraphs 4, 11 and 15, it was held thus:
4. Now there is no dispute that by the suit contract the appellant agreed not only to
sell the property to the respondent but also to put him in possession of it. It was this
contract of which the court decreed specific performance, the contract to execute the
sale-deed and give the respondent possession of the property. On the failure of the
appellant, the court executed the sale-deed on his behalf in favour of the respondent.
On the terms of the contract of sale and under Section 55(1)(f), T. P. Act, the
appellant was bound to give possession of the property to the respondent. It was
incidental to the relief of specific performance that besides the conveyance
possession should also be given to the respondent; in other words that relief was a
mandate to the respondent to do both and thus complete the specific performance.
If he defaults in either it is for the court to do it for him at the respondent's instance and as the court
has already executed the sale- deed what remains is to carry out the appellant's unfulfilled obligation
to put the respondent in possession of the property. As the right to obtain possession is thus Implicit
in the decree, the absence of a specific relief for delivery of possession is immaterial. When the court
thus puts the respondent in possession of the property it is but executing the decree for specific
performance which is within its jurisdiction. The learned Judge who decided : AIR 1948 Nag 406
omitted to take note of the rights of the parties to a decree for specific performance but had merely
gone by the general principle that the power of the executing court is conditioned by the reliefs
granted by the decree. With respect I disagree from the view taken in that decision.
11. The question can be viewed in another aspect also. As observed earlier the Civil P. C. does not
prescribe any particular form in which decrees for specific performance should be drawn. It is
settled law as pointed out in H. I. Trust v. Haridas Mundhra, : AIR 1972 SC 1826 that "the court
which passes a decree for specific performance retains control over the decree even after the decree
has been passed". The effect of the decisions quoted with approval by the Supreme Court in para. 22
of the judgment is that the contract between the parties is not extinguished by the decree for specific
performance, that the decree is not a final decree and that the suit must be deemed to be pending
even after the decree and that it is virtually in the nature of a preliminary decree. The Supreme
Court also quoted with approval passages from Fry on Specific Performance (6th Edn. p. 546) and
from Halsbury's Laws of England, (3rd Edn. Vol. 36, 351-52) of which the following extracts could
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 24Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015
be helpfully reproduced:
"It may and not infrequently does happen that after judgment has been given for the
specific performance of a contract, some further relief becomes necessary, in
consequence of one or other of the parties making default in the performance of
something which ought under the judgment to be performed by him or on his part; as
for instance, where a vendor refuses or is unable to execute a proper conveyance of
the property, or a purchaser to pay the purchase money ... ... ..." (Fry) "Ancillary relief
may be obtained after judgment in an action for specific performance where such
further relief becomes necessary ... ... ... (Halsbury) (In this decision the Supreme
Court rescinded a decree for specific performance of a contract for the sale of shares,
owing to the refusal of the seller to perform his part of the contract, even though
Section 28 of the Specific Relief Act 1963 provides only for rescission of decree for
specific performance for the sale or lease of immovable property).
15. What remains to consider Is the appellant's alternate contention based on Section
22 of the Specific Relief Act 1963. That section reads :
"22. Power to grant relief for possession, partition, refund of earnest money, etc.--(1)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Civil P. C. 1908 (5 of
1908), any person suing for the specific performance of a contract for the transfer of
immovable property may, in an appropriate case, ask for-
(a) possession, or partition and separate possession, of the property, in addition to
such performance; or
(b) any other relief to which the may be entitled, including the refund of earnest
money or deposit paid or made to him, in case his claim for specific performance is
refused. (2) No relief under Clause (a) or Clause (b) of Sub-section (1) shall be
granted by the Court unless it has been specifically claimed:
Provided that where the plaintiff has not claimed any such relief in the plaint, the
Court shall, at any stage of the proceeding, allow him to amend the plaint on such
terms as may be just for including a claim for such relief.
(3) The power of the Court to grant relief under Clause (b) of Sub-section (1) shall be
without prejudice to its powers to award compensation under Section 21." The suit
out of which the appeal arises was instituted after the 1963 Act came into force and it
is urged that Sub-section (2) is an absolute bar to the grant of the relief of possession
as the respondent had not claimed it in terms of Clause (a) of Sub-section (1).
Counsel contends that the appellant was in possession of the property and' it was
therefore an "appropriate case" within Sub-section (1) where the respondent could
have claimed recovery of possession and that not having been done the bar under
Sub-section (2) operates.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 25Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015
The answer to this contention has to be found in the true meaning and significance of the expression
"in an appropriate case" in Sub-section (1). It had been settled by judicial decisions that a plaintiff
may claim a decree for possession in a suit for specific performance, even though strictly speaking,
the right to possession accrues only when specific performance is decreed. Where the defendant is in
possession and the plaintiff could ask for possession and that position has been settled, it is
legitimate to think that the Legislature contemplated a different situation when it framed the
expression "in an appropriate case". On that aspect I find myself, with respect, in agreement with
the following discussion in Gyasa v. Risalo "The expression 'in an appropriate case' indicates that it
is not always incumbent on the plaintiff to claim possession or partition or separate possession in a
suit for specific performance of contract for the transfer of the immovable property. That is to be
done where the circumstances demand it. The relief for specific performance of the contract of sale
embraces within its ambit not only the execution of the sale deed but also possession over the
property conveyed under the sale deed. It may not always be necessary for the plaintiff to specifically
claim possession over the property, the relief for possession being inherent in the relief for specific
performance of the contract for sale. It cannot, however, be disputed that in certain circumstances
relief of possession cannot be effectively granted to the decree-holder without specifically claiming
relief for possession e.g., where the property agreed to be conveyed is jointly held by the defendant
with other persons. In such a case the plaintiff in order to obtain complete and effective relief must
claim partition of the property and possession over the share of the defendant." And "Similarly a
case may be visualised where after the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant the property
passed in possession of a third person. A mere relief for specific performance of the contract of sale
may not entitle the plaintiff to obtain possession as against the party in actual possession of the
property. As against him a decree for possession must be specifically claimed for such a person is
not bound by the contract sought to be enforced. It appears that Section 22 of the Specific Relief Act
was enacted to get over such technical difficulties and to avoid multiplicity of suits. In a case where
exclusive possession is with the contracting party, a decree for specific performance of the contract
of sale simpliciter without specifically providing for delivery of possession, may give complete relief
to the decree- holder. In order to satisfy the decree against him completely the is bound not only to
execute the sale deed but also to put the property in possession of the decree holder. This is in
consonance with the provisions of Section 55(1)(f) of the T. P. Act which provides that the seller is
bound to give, on being so required, the buyer or such person as he directs, such possession of the
property as its nature admits."
In my view the property being in the possession of the judgment- debtor, as in that case, Section
22(2) is no bar to delivery of possession of the property to the decree-holder. I reject the appellant's
argument on this point.
The judgment of the courts below are confirmed and the appeal is dismissed with costs.
27. From a reading of the principles and parameters laid down in the above referred judgments cited
by the learned counsel for the respondent wherein the Courts elaborately and thoroughly analysed
and considered the issue in the light of the provisions of Section 28 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963
and Section 55(1)(f) of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, it can now be safely concluded that even
in the absence of any specific clause in the decree for recovery of possession, the executing court is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/65986967/ 26Smt.Sarverunnisa Begum vs Syed Rafeeq on 9 March, 2015
undoubtedly and unhesitatingly is competent to order delivery of the property covered by the suit
agreement of sale. It is further clear that the decree for mere specific performance implies a decree
for possession also. The provisions of Section 28 of Specific Relief Act and Section 55(1)(f) of the TP
Act obligate the seller to deliver the property. In fact, this Court in the decision reported in
Smt.Suluguru Vijaya v. Pulumati Manjula (9 supra) considered the judgment of the Supreme Court
in Adcon Electronics Pvt. Ltd., v. Daulat (1 supra) and also the judgment of the Supreme Court in
Babu Lal v. M/s Hazari Lal Kishori Lal (7 supra) and eventually placed reliance on Babu Lals case
wherein the Hon'ble Supreme court elaborately considered Section 28 of the Specific Relief Act and
Section 55 of the Transfer of Property Act.
28. A reading of the judgment of the Supreme Court makes it evident that in the judgment in Adcon
Electronics Pvt. Ltd., v. Daulat (1 supra), the Honble Apex Court had no occasion to consider either
Section 28 of the Specific Relief Act or Section 55 of the TP Act nor the said provisions of law were
brought to the notice of the Honble Supreme Court and the judgment of the Honble Apex Court in
Babu Lal v. M/s Hazari Lal Kishori Lal (7 supra), wherein the Honble Apex Court elaborately
considered the said provisions of law was also not brought to the notice of the Hon'ble Apex Court.
29. It needs to be remembered that a mature legal system proceeds always a step forward and
endeavours to provide not merely a remedy for every right infringed but also an adequate remedy.
The endeavour of the Courts should be in the direction of providing speedy and meaningful justice
to the society and Courts should also strive for effective and expeditious implementation of the
decrees, otherwise there is every possibility of citizens losing faith and confidence in the system. In
the name of technicalities and inappropriate procedural shackles the validly rendered decrees
should not be allowed to be frustrated at the instance of the wise and seasoned litigants and the
innocent decree holders should not be allowed to suffer and their legitimate rights should never be
permitted to be invaded. The contention of the learned counsel for petitioner that the Executing
Court cannot go beyond the decree also pales into insignificance in view of the law laid down in the
above referred judgments.
30. In the teeth of the statutory duties imposed by the provisions of Section 28 of the Specific Relief
Act and Section 55 of the Transfer of Property Act on the seller and keeping in view the area of
operation of Section 22 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 and keeping in view the interpretation given
to the phrase "inappropriate cases" as stipulated in Section 22 of the Specific Relief Act in the above
referred judgments and keeping in view the reality that the property is only in the possession of the
judgment debtor but not in the possession of any third party and having regard to the ratio laid
down in the authoritative pronouncement of the Apex Court, wherein the Supreme Court
elaborately and extensively considered the impact of the provisions of Section 28 of the Specific
Relief Act and Section 55(1)(f) of the Transfer of Property Act, this Court expresses absolutely no
scintilla of hesitation nor any traces of doubt to hold that the there is no legal infirmity in the
impugned order, warranting interference of this Court under Section 115 of CPC. This Court also
finds that the order under revision is well reasoned and well crafted and this Court finds no reason
to meddle with the impugned order.

shall stand closed. There shall be no order as to costs.
