ORDER
K.S. Radhakrishnan, J.
1. Would the bar under Section 11(9) of Act 2 of 1965 affect an application filed under Section 11 of
the Act if the parties are governed by an unregistered lease deed is the interesting question that has
come up for consideration in these cases.
2. Tenants are the revision petitioners in these cases. Petitions for eviction preferred under Section
11(2)(b), 11(4)(ii) and 11(4)(v) were resisted by the tenants under Section 11(9) of the Act on the
ground that where the tenancy is for a specific period agreed to between the landlord and the tenant,
landlord is not entitled to apply before the Rent Control Court for an order of eviction before the
expiry of that period.
3. C.R.P. No. 1628 of 1997 arises out of R.C.P. No. 2 of 1990, a petition filed by the landlord under
Sections 11(2)(b) and 11(4)(ii) of the Act. Parties are governed by Ext. A2 rent agreement dated
5.9.1988. Room was let out on a monthly rent of Rs. 750/-. Rent Control Petition was filed on
3.2.1990 claiming arrears of rent under Section 11(2)(b) and the Rent Control Court found that
tenant had committed default in payment of rent from 5.10.1988 onwards till 31.12.1990 at the rate
of Rs. 750/- per month and ordered eviction under Section 11(2)(b). Rent Control Court also allowed
the plea of the landlord that the tenant has used the building in such a manner as to destroy or
reduce its value or utility, materially and permanently. Appellate Authority also confirmed the
findings of the Rent Control Court.
4. C.R.P.No. 1764 of 1999 arises out of R.C.P.No. 35 of 1995 which is a petition filed by the landlord
under Sections 11(2)(b) and 11(4)(v). Parties are governed by Ext.A1 rent dated 17.1.1994. Schedule
room was rented out on a monthly rent of Rs. 400/-. Landlord claimed arrears for the period from
January 1995 to July 1995. Rent Control Court noticed that there is no arrears of rent. Consequently
claim under Section 11(2)(b) was rejected. Noticing that the tenant had ceased to occupy the
building continuously for a period of six months without reasonable cause, the Rent Control Court
ordered eviction. Appeal filed against that order was rejected.

5. C.R.P. No. 1985 of 1999 arises out of the order in LA. No 291 of 1998 in R.C.P. No. 30 of 1997.
I.A.No. 291 of 1998 was filed for setting aside the ex parte order. Rent Control Court found no
reason to set aside the order and dismissed the application. Appellate Authority confirmed the said
order against which this revision was filed by the tenant.
6. Ext. A2 unregistered lease deed dated 5.9.1988 governs the parties in C.R.P.No. 1628 of 1997. Ext.
A2 would indicate that the petition schedule building was let out for a period of 15 years for the
purpose of carrying on the business of selling gold and silver ornaments. Rate of rent shown in the
document is Rs. 750/- per month which had to be paid by the tenant on or before fifth of every
month. Rent Control Petition was filed on 3.2.1990 before the expiry of fifteen years from the date of
agreement. In CRP No. 1764 of 1999 parties are governed by Ext. A1 rent chit dated 17.1.1994. Rate
of rent fixed was Rs. 400 per month and the period of lease is for five years. Rent Control Petition
was filed on 24.7.1995. In CRP No. 1985 of 1999 also parties are the same in CRP No. 1764 of 1999
and are governed by the same rent chit dated 17.1.1994. In that case rent control petition was filed
on 4.7.1997 within a period of five years.
7. The question that is posed for consideration as we have already mentioned, is whether tenant
could use the unregistered lease deed as a defence under Section 11(9) of the Act to defeat a claim
raised by the landlord within the period specified in the lease deed for eviction of the tenant on any
of the grounds mentioned in Section 11 of the Act? The Kerala Buildings (Lease and Rent Control)
Act, 1965 is an Act enacted to regulate the leasing of buildings and to control the rent of such
buildings in the State of Kerala. The reason for the enactment is to regulate the leasing of the
buildings, prevention of unreasonable eviction of tenants and also for control of rent. The Act is a
self contained statute and the rights and liabilities of the landlord and tenant are to be governed by
its provisions. Rights available to the tenant and landlord under the general law and the Transfer of
Property Act are substantially curtailed by the provisions of the Rent Control Act. Though Rent
Control Act is a piece of social legislation mainly to protect tenants from frivolous eviction, certain
salutary provisions have also been made in the Act in order to do justice to the landlord. The
legislation is neither pro-tenant nor-pro-landlord. Rent Control Act does not clearly disable the
provisions contained in the Transfer of Property Act as far as rights of parties are concerned. At the
same time, it makes provision for eviction on such specified grounds and it cannot be resisted on the
basis of rights conferred under the Transfer of Property Act. When eviction is sought by the landlord
under the provisions of the Rent Control Act and once the requirement contemplated under the
Rent Control Act are satisfied, tenant cannot claim total prohibition of eviction on the basis of the
provisions contained in the Transfer of Property Act or the provisions contained in the Contract Act.
8. Section 11 of the Act confers certain rights on the landlord to get the tenant evicted on specified
grounds. But Section 11(9) gives an assurance to the tenant that he would not be evicted for a
specified period if parties so agree so that he could modulate his future course of action accordingly.
Grounds of bonafide need for own occupation or his dependent who is a member of his family or
requirement of additional accommodation etc. are not available to be raised by the landlord during
that specific period. But if the tenant fails to pay rent or without the consent of the landlord sublets
the building or transfers his rights or uses the building in such a manner as to reduce its value or
utility materially or permanently or ceased to occupy the building, landlord can seek an order of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126137/ 2Paul vs Saleena on 17 December, 2003
eviction even if a specific period is mentioned in the lease deed and Section 11(9) will not therefore
be a bar. There are certain statutory prohibitions, which the tenant is bound to honour unless a
contrary intention is spelt out from the agreement. On the guise of specific period mentioned in the
agreement the tenant is not expected to sublease the premises unless otherwise agreed to or
destroys the utility or value of the tenanted premises materially and permanently or commits default
in payment of rent or violates the statutory obligations. Section 11(9) calls for a purposive
interpretation so as to promote the purpose and object of the Act and not to circumvent the
statutory obligations cast on the tenant by the Rent Control Act.
9. "Landlord" defined in Section 2(3) of the Act includes any person who is receiving or is entitled to
receive the rent of a building, whether on his own account or on behalf of another or on behalf of
himself and others is one of the essential terms is the landlord-tenant relationship. If rent is not paid
by the tenant Section 11(2) comes to the rescue of the landlord. Section 11(3) also enables the
landlord to apply for an order of eviction if the landlord bonafide needs the building for his own
occupation or for the occupation by any member of his family dependent on him. Section 11(4)(i)
prohibits sublease as well as transfer of tenant's rights in the event of which it enables the landlord
to apply for eviction of the tenant. Section 11(4)(ii) also would caution the tenant that he shall not
use the building in such a manner as to destroy or reduce its value or utility, materially and
permanently. Section 11(4)(iii) states that the Rent Control Court can order eviction if the tenant has
in his possession a building or subsequently acquires possession of or puts up a building reasonably
sufficient for his requirement in the same city, town or village. Section 11(4)(iv) enables the landlord
to apply for eviction of the building if the building is in such a condition that it needs reconstruction
and if the landlord requires bona fide to reconstruct the same and if he satisfies the Court that he
has the plan and licence, if any required and the ability to rebuild and if the proposal is not made as
a pretext for eviction. Section 11(4)(v) enables the landlord to apply if the tenant ceases to occupy
the building continuously for six months without reasonable cause. Section 11(5) enables the
landlord who wants to renovate the building to apply for an order directing the tenant to permit him
to enter and carry out the renovation within a time to be fixed by the Court. Section 11(8) enables
the landlord to apply for eviction if he requires additional accommodation for his personal use.
Sections 11(2) and 11(3) gives various rights and obligations to the tenant as well as to the landlord,
so also Section 11(8). Contention was raised that when the landlord and tenant agree themselves
that the tenancy is for a specified and stipulated period as per the agreement, registered or
otherwise, parties are bound by the said agreement and irrespective of the grounds available to the
landlord under Sections 11(2), 11(4)(ii) and 11(4)(iv) landlord is not entitled to apply for eviction
before the expiry of the said period as per Section 11(9) of the Act.
10. The lease of immovable property is governed by Chapter V of the Transfer of Property Act. The
term "lease" defined in Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act reads as follows:
"A lease of immovable property is a transfer of a right to enjoy such property, made
for a certain time, express or implied, or in perpetuity, in consideration of a price
paid or promised, or of money, a share of crops, service or any other thing of value, to
be rendered periodically or on specified occasions to the transferor by the transferee,
who accepts the transfer on such terms."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126137/ 3Paul vs Saleena on 17 December, 2003
Contract to the contrary mentioned in Section 106 is from the date of notice of termination of the
lease and not with regard to the period of lease. Lease of immovable property for agricultural or
manufacturing purposes shall be deemed to be a lease from, year to year, terminable, on the part of
either lessor or lessee, by six months' notice and a lease of immovable property for any other
purpose shall be deemed to be a lease from month to month, terminable, on the part of either lessor
or lessee, by fifteen days notice unless there is a contract to the contrary. Section 106 deals with
duration of certain leases in the absence of written contract. Section 107 of the Transfer of Property
Act states that lease of immovable property from year to year, or for any term exceeding one year, or
reserving a yearly rent, can be made only by registered instrument. Rights and liabilities of the
lessor and lessees are dealt with in Section 108 of the Act. Section 108(A) deals with rights and
liabilities of the lessor. Section 108(B) deals with rights and liabilities of the lessee. Section 107
stipulates that lease of immovable property from year to year, or for any term exceeding one year, or
reserving a yearly rent, can be made only by a registered document.
11. The effect of non-registration of document required to be registered is dealt with in Section 49 of
the Registration Act, 1908, which says that "no document required by Section 17 or by any provision
of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 to be registered shall affect any immovable property comprised
therein, or confer any power to adopt, or be received as evidence of any transaction affecting such
property or conferring such power unless it has been registered. Proviso states that an unregistered
document affecting immovable property and required by this Act or the Transfer of Property Act,
1882 to be registered may be received as evidence of a contract in a suit for specific performance
under Chapter II of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 or as evidence of any collateral transaction not
required to be effected by registered instrument. Inter relation between Section 49 of the
Registration Act read with Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act and Section 91 of the Evidence
Act has come up for consideration before the Apex Court and various High Courts. Counsel on either
side took us through the various decisions on the point.
12. Apex Court in Anthony v. K.C. Ittoop & Sons, (2000) 6 SCC 394, examined the relationship
between landlord and tenant on the basis of the unregistered instrument. That was a case where
lease deed was intended to be operative for a period of five years. The deed was unregistered
document. Apex Court held that such lease could not create a lease on the basis of the inhibition
contained in Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and Sections 17(1) and 49 of the
Registration Act, 1908. The Court held that the resultant position is insurmountable that so far as
the instrument of lease is concerned there is no scope for holding that the appellant is a lessee by
virtue of the said instrument. The Court is disabled from using the instrument as evidence and
hence it goes out of consideration, hook, line and sinker. In Satish Chand Makhan and Ors. v.
Govardhan Das Byas and Ors., 1984 (1) SCC 369, the Apex Court examined the scope of
unregistered draft lease agreement. While dealing with the provisions of Section 17(1)(d) and 49
read with Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, held as follows:
"The unregistered draft lease agreement Ext.B2 was clearly inadmissible in evidence
under Section 4 of the Registration Act, except for the collateral purpose of proving
the nature and character of possession of the defendants. The document Ext.B2 was
admissible under the proviso to Section 49 only for a collateral purpose of showing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126137/ 4Paul vs Saleena on 17 December, 2003
the nature and character of possession of the defendants. The proviso to Section 49
was however not applicable in the present case inasmuch as the terms of a lease are
not a "collateral purpose" within its meaning. It follows that the unregistered draft
lease agreement Ext.B2 was inadmissible in evidence to prove the transaction of
lease. It was also ineffectual to create a valid lease for a renewed term of nine years
for want of registration as required under Section 17(1)(d) of the Registration Act."
The Apex Court in Samir Mukherjee v. Davinder K. Bajaj and Ors., (2001) 5 SCC 259, examined the
scope of Sections 106 and 107 of the Transfer of Property Act and held as follows:
"Section 106 lays down a rule of construction which is to apply when the parties have
not specifically agreed upon as to whether the lease is yearly or monthly. On a plain
reading of this section it is clear that the Legislature has classified leases into two
categories according to their proposes and this section would be attracted to construe
the duration of a valid lease in the absence of a contract or local law or usage to the
contrary. Where the parties by a contract have indicated the duration of a lease, this
section would not apply. What this section does is to prescribe the duration of the
period of different kinds of leases by legal fiction - Leases for agricultural or
manufacturing purposes shall be deemed to be lease from year to year and all other
leases shall be deemed to be from month to month. Existence of a valid lease is a
prerequisite to invoke the rule of construction embodied in Section 106 of the
Transfer of Property Act.
Section 107 prescribes the procedure for execution of a lease between the parties.
Under the first para of this section a lease of immovable property from year to year or
for any term exceeding one year or reserving a yearly rent can be made only by a
registered instrument and remaining classes of leases are governed by the second
para, that is to say all other leases of immovable property can be made either by a
registered instrument or by an oral agreement accompanied by delivery of
possession".
The above mentioned statutory provisions and the decisions would conclusively show in the absence
of a registered instrument no valid lease from year to year or a term exceeding one year or reserving
yearly rent can be created.
13. In the instant case, admittedly lease deeds are unregistered documents. Therefore, tenancy is to
be treated as tenancy from month to month. Contention was raised even if lease agreements are
unregistered, period mentioned in the unregistered agreement is the essential condition of the lease
and consequently parties are bound by the said terms and conditions irrespective of the fact whether
a document is registered or not. Counsel also submitted that unregistered document can be treated
as evidence under the proviso to Section 49. Section 49 is extracted below for easy reference.
49. Effect of non-registration of documents required to be registered.- No document required by
Section 17 (or by any provision of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882) to be registered shall-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126137/ 5Paul vs Saleena on 17 December, 2003
(a) affect any immovable property comprised therein, or
(b) confer any power to adopt, or
(c) be received as evidence of any transaction affecting such property or conferring
such power, unless it has been registered:
Provided that an unregistered document affecting immovable property and required
by this Act, or the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, to be registered may be received as
evidence of a contract in a suit for specific performance under Chapter II of the
Specific Relief Act, 1877, or as evidence of any collateral transaction not required to
be effected by registered instrument.
We may now examine even if document is an unregistered one, whether the period
mentioned therein would be binding on the parties and consequently petition filed
before the period mentioned in the document would be hit by Section 11(9) of the Act.
In the absence of registration, lease of immovable property from year to year or for
any term exceeding one year shall be deemed to be from month to month. Therefore,
we may proceed as if rent agreements executed between the parties in these cases are
leases from month to month. All the same, we may examine as to whether the period
specified in the unregistered lease deeds could be treated as defence within the
meaning of the proviso to Section 49 and consequently fall within the rigor of Section
11(9) of the Act. Section 17 of the Registration Act deals with documents of which
registration is compulsory. Section 17(d) deals with leases of immovable property
from year to year, or for any term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent which
requires compulsory registration. It is true that Section 17 does not say that
unregistered document shall not be received in evidence. Section 49 bars reception in
evidence of document or proceeding which is required to be registered under Section
17 of the Registration Act but not registered. The Apex Court in Champalal v.
Samrathbai (AIR 1960 SC 629) held that filing of an unregistered award under
Section 49 is not prohibited, what is prohibited is that it cannot be taken into
evidence so as to affect immovable property falling under Section 17. In Dinaji and
Ors. v. Daddi and Ors., AIR 1990 SC 1153, the Apex Curt held that non registration of
a document which is required to be registered under Section 17(1)(b) of the
Registration Act will not avail to create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish any right,
title or interest in or to the immovable property comprised in the document. Section
49 stipulates that no document required to be registered under Section 17 of the
Transfer of Property Act shall be received as evidence of any transaction affecting
such property or conferring such power unless it has been registered. The Apex Court
in Satish Chand Mukhan and Ors. v. Goverdhandas Byas and Ors., AIR 1984 SC 143,
held that where a lessee remained in possession under an unregistered deed of
renewal of lease, such deed of renewal was inadmissible in evidence under Section 49
except for the collateral purpose of proving the nature and character of his
possession. In Bajaj Auto Ltd. v. Bahari Lal Kolhi, AIR 1989 SC 1806, the Apex Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126137/ 6Paul vs Saleena on 17 December, 2003
held that where a lease is entitled to create a sub-lease or not is undoubtedly a
question of a term of the transaction of lease, and if it is incorporated in the
document it cannot be disassociated from the lease and considered separately in
isolation. If a document is inadmissible for nonregistration all its terms are
inadmissible including the one dealing with the landlord's permission to his tenant to
sublet. The Calcutta High Court in Pieco Electronics & Electricals Ltd. v. Smt. Tribeni
Deve (AIR 1990 Cal. 135), held that ejectment cannot be sought on the basis of a
duration clause in an unregistered lease. Unregistered lease could at best be looked
into for ascertaining the commencement of possession, rate of rent or similar other
provisions which are collateral to the principal transaction. The Court held it could
never have been the intention of the legislature that under the first part of the section
we should discard an unregistered document for want of registration and at the same
time under the camouflage of the proviso we should be permitted to look into and
rely upon all the terms of the inoperative document which do form the integral parts
of the principal transaction.
14. The various provisions contained in Sections 11(2) to 11(8) of the Rent Control Act
are substantial provisions. Compulsorily registerable document, though unregistered
and inadmissible as evidence of a transaction affecting immovable property, may be
admitted as evidence of collateral facts, or for any collateral purpose, that is for any
purpose other than that of creating, declaring, assigning, limiting or extinguishing a
right to immovable property. Reference be made to the decision of the Bombay High
Court in Bai Gulabbai v. Shri Datgarji, 1907 (9) Bom.L.R. 393, and Panchapagesa v.
Kalyanasundaram, AIR 1957 Madras 472). An unregistered deed of lease can be used
for a collateral purpose to show the nature of possession. In Ishwar Dutt v. Sunder
Singh (AIR 1961 J & K 45) it was held that the term of lease is not a collateral
purpose. In Antonia Perreira v. Upendra Venkatesh Juarkar, AIR 1978 Goa 19, it was
held that the duration of the lease for a fixed period exceeding one year is not a
collateral purpose. In A.N. Parkas v. N.H. Nagvi, AIR 1989 Delhi 277, it was held that
an unregistered document of lease can be looked into to know the purpose of letting
whether residential or commercial, because the said term can be deemed to be
collateral matter. In Jagajit Industries Ltd. v. Rajiv Gupta, AIR 1981 Delhi 359) it was
held that term in a lease regarding notice of eviction in a term which affects
immovable property and therefore it cannot be said to be a collateral transaction. In
Zarif Ahmad and Anr. v. Satish Kumar and Anr., AIR 1983 All. 164) it has been held
that an unregistered lease cannot be admitted in evidence for the purpose of
ascertaining the date on which the tenancy began and what the rent reserved was.
The Apex Court in Rai Chand Jain v. Miss Chandra Kanta Khosla, AIR 1991 SC 744,
held that an unregistered lease can be looked into for collateral purposes like for
ascertaining whether the purpose of the lease was residential or not.
15. The above mentioned judicial pronouncements and the principles laid down
therein would clearly show that an unregistered document cannot be used for the
purpose of establishing that that document created or declared or assigned or limited
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126137/ 7Paul vs Saleena on 17 December, 2003
or extinguished a right to immovable property. Period of lease is integral part of the
agreement and not a collateral one. Unregistered lease deeds cannot be pressed into
service to create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish any right, title or interest in or to
the property comprised in the document. They create only month to month tenancy
and only if the lease is registered under the Registration Act, it would create transfer
of right to enjoy the immovable property for a specific term exceeding one year. We
therefore hold that unregistered lease deeds by which rights of parties in these cases
are governed would not stand in the way of the landlord from filing application under
Sections 11(2)(b), 11(4)(ii) or 111(4)(v) of Act 2 of 1965 and the application would hot
be hit by Section 11(9) of the Act.
16. Counsel appearing for the tenant contended that the landlord is not entitled to get
eviction under Section 11(4)(ii) of the Act. In the rent chit it is specifically stated that
the building shall not be subjected to material alteration. Contention of the tenant
was that he had removed window situated on the northern side wall and closed down
that portion using bricks. Similarly a window was also removed from the western wall
and another door from the southern wall and closed down those portions using
bricks. Tenant also lowered the level of the floor of the building and cut and removed
six wooden pieces and has installed concrete pillars at a distance of one feet from the
wall of the building. Landlord submitted that the tenant has used the building in such
a manner as to destroy and reduce its value and utility materially and permanently.
In order to establish the case landlord took out a commission. Ext. C1 is the
commission report dated 23.11.1992. Tenant on the other hand contended that the
modification he has made has not affected the utility or value of the building
materially or permanently. Counsel also placed reliance on several decisions.
Reference was made to the decision of the Apex Court in Manmohan Das Shah v.
Bishum Das, AIR 1967 SC 643, Vipin Kumar v. Roshanlal Anand and Ors., (1993) 2
SCC 614, Seethalakshmi Ammal v. Nabeesath Beevi, 2003 (1) KLT 391, Waryam
Singh v. Baldev Singh, (2003) 1 SCC 59, Aboobacker v. Nanu, 2001 (3) KLT 815, G.
Arunachalam v. Thopndarperlenambi, AIR 1992 SC 977, and various other decisions.
It is well settled to examine the question as to whether tenant used the building in
such a manner as to reduce its value and utility permanently or materially, stand
point of the landlord is important. The question as to whether the tenant has altered
the tenanted premises reducing its value and utility materially or permanently has to
be decided in the facts and circumstances of each case. Formation of the opinion by
the landlord is subjective but the existence of circumstances relevant to the inference
is a sine qua non for the formation of such opinion by the landlord.
17. As far as this case is concerned, Ext.C1 commission report would positively show
that window was removed from the western wall and a window from the northern
wall. Commission report would indicate that the commissioner could not see any
door or window on the northern and western walls of the building. Tenant examined
as CPW1 had admitted that at the time when he took the petition schedule building
on rent there was a door on the western wall and a window on the northern wall and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126137/ 8Paul vs Saleena on 17 December, 2003
that he had removed both of them. He also admitted that he had removed two
windows from the northern wall, one door and a window from the western wall and
another door from the southern wall. Commission report would indicate that the
scheduled room is the north-eastern room of a larger old building and that the floor
of the scheduled room lies at a level lower by one feet from the floor level of the
adjacent southern room. The floor of the southern room was found furnished with
old tiles and the floor was seen cemented. Commissioner has also noted that in the
other adjacent room there are only folding wooden frames whereas for the scheduled
room alone concrete pillars and beam have been found installed to which rolling
shutters have been fitted. It is also stated that for the purpose of installing the rolling
shutter and above the shutter the eastern end of the rafters of the roof have been
found cut and removed to a length of 2 ft. The above mentioned facts would show
that tenant has used the building in such a manner as to reduce its utility and value
materially and permanently. Both the Rent Control Court and the Appellate
Authority found that ground against the tenant. We find no reason to take a different
view in our revisional jurisdiction.
18. Tenant in CRP No. 1764 of 1999 has also attacked the order of eviction under
Section 11(4)(v). It is trite law that it is the burden of the landlord to show that tenant
has ceased to occupy the premises continuously for a period of six months without
reasonable cause. In order to establish the case, it is the specific case of the landlord
that the schedule room was never occupied by the first respondent after it is
entrusted to him. Though for sometime tenant has been conducting vegetable shop
thereafter the shop room was kept closed. After 1994 the shop room was always kept
locked and unoccupied. Third petitioner gave evidence to the effect that first
respondent has not used the building after it was taken on rent from the original
landlord's father in November 1994. First respondent used to open the room and
clean it. Thereafter the room was always remaining locked. First respondent was
working at Bombay since January 1995 onwards. Exts. A3 and A4 are the notices
issued to the first respondent which were returned undelivered. In order to show that
the room was kept closed PW2 was examined. PW1 has also given evidence to that
effect. In Ext.C1 commission report it has been stated that RW6 has stated that at the
time of inspection on 24.7.1875 schedule room was seen closed and locked with rust
and cobwebs on the front shutters. There were posters affixed on the front shutters.
First respondent has stated that for doing the business in soda, cigarette, beedi, pan
etc. no licence was obtained by him. Fifth respondent who inspected the schedule
room on 25.7.1995 could not find any business in cool drinks as claimed by RW3. The
fact that there was no shelf or other device to keep the vegetables in the schedule
room would indicate that no such business was carried on there. All these factors
were taken into consideration by the Rent Control Court and the Appellate Authority
and came to the conclusion that tenant has ceased to occupy the premises. We find
no reason to interfere with the orders of the courts below in our revisional
jurisdiction. The revision petition stands dismissed.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126137/ 9Paul vs Saleena on 17 December, 2003
19. C.R.P.No. 1985 of 1999 also has to be dismissed. Order of eviction was passed in
this case since tenant failed to pay the rent. Though application to set aside the order
was filed the same was dismissed which was later confirmed by the Appellate
Authority. Since we have already found that landlord is entitled to get eviction under
Section 11(4)(v) this revision is also liable to be dismissed. We do so. The tenants in
all these cases are given three month's time from today for vacating the premises on
condition that each of them should file an undertaking before the Rent Control Court
within one month from today that they would vacate the premises within the
aforesaid period and would pay arrears of rent, if any and future rent.
