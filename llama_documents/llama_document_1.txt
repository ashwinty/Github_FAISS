JUDGMENT
S.K. Roy Chowdhury, J.
1. This is an appeal from a judgment and order making a rule issued in the writ petition against the
appellant absolute.
2. The relevant facts of the case which are not very much in dispute are as follows:
3. Respondent No. 1, Messrs. Vishnu Agencies Private Ltd., is a registered dealer under the Bengal
Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941, and a licensed stockist and dealer of cement, which is a controlled
commodity and its distribution is completely regulated by the West Bengal Cement Control Act and
the orders and notifications made thereunder.
4. There is no dispute that respondent No. 1 is a licensed stockist under the said Cement Control Act
and the orders and notifications made thereunder from time to time.
5. The only question raised in this appeal is whether the transactions between respondent No. 1,
Messrs. Vishnu Agencies Private Ltd., and the permit licence-holders for cement Issued by the
Director of Textile and Consumer Goods, and West Bengal State Licensing Authority for Iron, Steel
and Cement, constitute sale of goods under the Sale of Goods Act. In other words, are the provisions
of the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941, attracted in respect of transactions referred to by
respondent No. 1 in the original writ petition by making supplies to the permit-holders for cement,
which they allege are not voluntary sales but deliveries under compulsion made by the petitioners
under the terms of the permit issued to the permit-holders and the said Cement Control Order and
orders and notifications issued thereunder. Therefore, the only question in the appeal whether the
transaction mentioned in the petition amounts to sale of goods so as to attract the provisions of the
Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941. In order to appreciate the question which has been argued
exhaustively by both the parties by citing large number of decisions mostly of the Supreme Court, it
is first necessary to set out the relevant portions of the said Cement Control Act and the orders and
notifications made thereunder, the terms of licence of a stockist and dealer of cement and also the
form of licence for cement issued to permit-holders.

3. Loss of the permit and failure to utilise it must be reported to the licensing

7. In the writ petition the case made out by respondent No. 1 is that it is a licensed
stockist under the said Cement Control Act and used to supply cement to
permit-holders at stipulated price in accordance with these permits which were
issued by the authorities concerned, a specimen of which is mentioned hereinbefore.
Respondent No. 1 further alleged that there was no element of volition or any
bargaining power left to it in the course of dealing between it as a registered stockist
and the permit-holder. Respondent No. 1 had no option regarding selection of
parties, fixation of price or willingness to sell the commodities and, as a matter of
fact, there was no element of mutual assent which is a condition precedent for
constituting the transaction as a sale within the meaning of the Bengal Finance (Sales
Tax) Act, 1941, and it was contended by respondent No. 1 in the writ petition that if
the transactions are sales within the meaning of the said Bengal Finance (Sales Tax)
Act, 1941, in that event, the said Act is ultra vires the legislative competency of the
Provincial Legislature under the Government of India Act, 1933, and the State
Legislature under the Constitution of India. It is alleged that in the sales tax
assessment for the quarter ending on 31st January, 1956,31st January, 1957, 31st
January, 1958, and 31st January, 1959, the appellant has Imposed sale tax on the said
transactions and respondent No. 1 bona fide under mistake of fact and law believed
that such transactions were sales and could be lawfully taxed under the Bengal
Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941. It is alleged by respondent No. 1 that such mistake was
discovered by it in 1963 upon perusal of the decision of the Supreme Court in the case
of New India Sugar Mills A.I.R. 1963 S.C. 1207. Thereafter the petitioner preferred
several appeals from the said assessment orders before the Assistant Commissioner
of Sales Tax and as the appeals were not disposed of, the petitioner moved a writ
petition in this court and by an order dated 11th December, 1970, the rule issued in
the said writ petition was made absolute directing the appellant to deal with and
dispose of the said appeals after giving respondent No. 1 an opportunity of being
heard. Thereafter the said matters were remanded and the Assistant Commissioner
of Commercial Taxes, Dharmatala Circle, disposed of the said appeals holding that
the sales made by respondent No. 1 under the Cement Control Order were taxable
under the Sales Tax Act. The order made in the appeal by the said Assistant
Commissioner of Commercial Taxes was dated 22nd December, 1971, a copy of which
is also annexed to the writ petition of respondent No. 1. Thereafter the present writ
petition, out of which the present appeal arises, was filed and the rule nisi was issued
on 21st April, 1972, which rule was made absolute by the order and judgment dated
18th December, 1972, which is the subject-matter of this appeal.
8. Mr. Provat Kumar Sengupta with Mr. Samarendra Nath Dutta appearing for the
appellants after drawing our attention to the relevant provisions of the said Cement
Control Act and the orders, notifications and conditions of licence issued to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978164/ 7Commercial Tax Officer And Ors. vs Vishnu Agencies (P.) Ltd. on 13 December, 1974
stockist and dealers and also the conditions of licence for cement to the consumer
submitted that all the elements of sale are present in the transactions. There are
contracting parties competent to enter into contracts. There are goods, property in
respect whereof is being transferred, that is, property in goods 3s passing by the
transactions. Mr. Sengupta submitted that there is consensus between the parties and
volition is there; when the dealer takes the licence for selling the goods he makes an
offer to sell the goods on the conditions of licence issued to him. When the purchaser
comes to purchase for valuable consideration he has full option to purchase or not to
purchase. When the seller (stockist and dealer of cement under the said Cement
Control Act) applies for a licence he agress to make an offer for sale on the terms and
conditions prescribed by the licence. When the purchaser applies for a permit he also
agrees to buy from a licensed dealer on the terms and conditions to be offered by the
licensed dealer. Therefore, Mr. Sengupta rightly submits that there is volition both on
the part of the seller and the purchaser.
9. In the transactions in question there is also an offer and acceptance. Mr. Sengupta
submits that only the distribution and supply of cement is controlled by certain laws
of land being the said Cement Control Act and the orders made thereunder.
Thereafter Mr. Sengupta referred to a large number of cases. Those are :
10. State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley & Co. {Madras) Ltd. A.I.R. 1958 S.C. 560,
New India Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, Bihar A.I.R. 1963 S.C.
1207, Indian Steel and Wire Products Ltd. v. State of Madras A.I.R. 1968 S.C. 478,
Andhra Sugars Ltd. v. State of Andhra Pradesh A.I.R. 1968 S.C. 599, State of
Rajasthan v. Karam Chand Thappar and Brothers A.I.R. 1969 S.C. 343, Chittar Mal
Narain Das v. Commissioner of Sales Tax A.I.R. 1970 S.C. 2000, Raghunandan
Prasad Mohan Lal v. State of U.P. A.I.R. 1971 S.C. 2089, Cement Marketing Co. of
India, Bangalore v. State of Mysore [1971] 27 S.T.C. 159 (S.C), Kotha Narasimham
Amburi v. State of Andhra Pradesh [1971] 27 S.T.C. 191, Excise and Taxation Officer,
Hissar v. Jaswant Singh [1971] 27 S.T.C. 582, Salar Jung Sugar Mills Ltd. v. State of
Mysore A.I.R. 1972 S.C. 87, Chowringhee Sales Bureau P. Ltd. v. Commissioner of
Income-tax, West Bengal 87 I.T.R. 542 (S.C), State of Tamil Nadu v. Cement
Distributors P. Ltd. A.I.R. 1973 S.C. 668, Deputy Commissioner of Agricultural
Income-tax and Sales Tax, Kozmkode v. V. Sreedhara Shenoy [1973] 32 S.T.C. 181,
and Maheswar Mahapatro v. State of Orissa [1972] 29 S.T.C. 52.
11. Relying on the principles laid down in those decisions, Mr. Sengupta analysed the
facts of this case and submitted that only the production, supply and distribution of,
and trade and commerce in, cement in West Bengal has been controlled by the
Cement Control Act. Freedom of contract regarding sale of cement is not completely
taken away but. only control within certain limits is imposed. As for example, supply
can only be made to permit-holders for cement issued by the appropriate authority,
maximum price of the cement is fixed, which is exclusive of sales tax payable on such
sale and the quantity is also limited by the permit with a view to ensure equitable
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978164/ 8Commercial Tax Officer And Ors. vs Vishnu Agencies (P.) Ltd. on 13 December, 1974
distribution of cement in the State. Mr. Sengupta rightly submitted that the stockist
and distributor of cement are agreeable to carry on their trade and commerce on the
terms and conditions of the licence issued under the said Act by applying to the
appropriate authority under the Cement Control Act for grant of a permit to the
stockist and dealer to which category the respondent belonged. Therefore, It cannot
be said that there is no offer to the buyer by the seller as to the terms on which
contract for sale is to be entered Into. The terms of licence which have been set out
before clearly indicate that the dealer and stockist of cement makes an offer for sale
to the person who would be granted permit for cement by the appropriate authority
on the terms and conditions mentioned in such permit. Therefore, it cannot be urged
that there is no element of volition on the part of the buyers and sellers of cement
under the said Cement Control Act. The licence under which the dealer and stockist
carry on their business and the terms of permit Issued to the buyer constitutes offer
and acceptance and gives the transaction the character of a contract. Mr. Sengupta
rightly submitted that this is not a case of compulsory acquisition of property and
payment of compensation. He analysed the terms of the licence and the terms of the
stockist and dealer of cement and terms of the permit granted to the buyer of cement
and very rightly submitted that it still retains fair amount of volition in the field of
contract, as for example, parties may agree as to the mode of payment either in cash
or in credit, deliveries by instalments and mode of delivery and time of delivery.
Delivery may be postponed on various circumstances- like stock of cement exhausted
or the permit-holders of cement do not want to take up the entire quantity under the
permit within the time specified- subject only to this that necessary endorsement or
variation has to be notified and sanctioned by the appropriate authority under the
said Cement Control Act. Mr. Sengupta analysing those aspects of the transactions
Involved under the Cement Control Act between a stockist and a permit-holder
submitted that it is not completely denuded of all the elements of a contract but
retained fair amount of volition to the parties entering into the said transaction so as
to constitute a sale of goods within the meaning of the Indian Sale of Goods Act as
laid down by the catena of Supreme Court decisions referred to by both the parties.
Mr. Sengupta summarised his contentions as follows :
(1) That under the transactions the maximum price has been fixed. The seller is
entitled to sell even at a lower price than to the highest price fixed by the said permit
issued under the Cement Control Act.
(2) The purchaser might take delivery of the goods immediately or within a period of
15 days as he chooses and to be agreed between the parties and, therefore, there is a
volition as to the same.
(3) The purchaser may either pay in cash or he can arrange for deferred payment, the
stipulation is that he is to deposit within 15 days. Supposing the purchaser has an
account with the seller, the seller may give the purchaser credit and, as such, there is
the same amount of volition left to the parties so as to constitute the said transaction
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978164/ 9Commercial Tax Officer And Ors. vs Vishnu Agencies (P.) Ltd. on 13 December, 1974
as a sale. In order to constitute a sale there must be an agreement for sale of goods for
a price and the passing of property therein and all these elements are present in those
transactions.
(4) Sale is defined in Section 2(g) of the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941, and a
sale is complete as soon as the goods are transferred and price Is paid or deferred
payment is arranged for. Such transfers of goods are sales within the meaning of the
said Act. The vires of the said Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941, have not been
challenged in this case.
12. Therefore, Mr. Sengupta submitted that the appeal should be allowed and it should be held that
the transactions relating to supply and delivery of cement by respondent No. 1 to the permit-holders
for the relevant years which are the subject-matter of this appeal are "sales" within the meaning of
the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941, and as such liable to sales tax.
13. Mr. Ranadeb Chowdhury with Mr. R. C. Deb, Mr. Soumendra Chandra Bose and Mr. Mukul
Prakash Banerjee appearing for the respondent raised the question whether the type of sale covered
by the licence issued from time to time read in the background of Section 3(2)(e) of the Cement
Control Act can be made liable to taxation under the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941. Mr.
Chowdhury submitted that reading Section 3(2)(a) and (e) along with the penal consequences under
the Act it is quite clear that the volition or freedom to contract is completely taken away and the
transaction pursuant to the said Cement Control Order by supplying the permit-holders is not a
contract for sale within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act. Mr. Chowdhury submitted that in the
said transaction there is no element of volition at all. There is no offer, no acceptance and no
meeting of minds of purchaser and seller in the said transactions. Mr. Chowdhury very strongly
relied on various passages from the Supreme Court decision in New India Sugar Mills Ltd. A.I.R.
1963 S.C. 1207. Mr. Chowdhury thereafter submitted that the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941,
has no bearing on the subject. The transactions in order to be a sale must be under entry 54 of List II
in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution corresponding to the Government of India Act, 1935,
item 48. In order to be a sale of goods it must be a sale within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act.
Mr. Chowdhury submitted that whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of this case, the
disposal of cement pursuant to directions contained in annexure A to the writ petition of the
respondent is liable to be taxed under the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941. Thereafter, Mr.
Chowdhury submitted that in order to be a contract there must be four elements, viz., (1) willingness
to contract, (2) mutuality, that is, volition of both the parties to a contract and meeting of minds to
enter into an agreement and a contract, (3) price in cash not barter or exchange, mode of payment
being not material, and (4) transfer of property. Mr. Chowdhury referred to Section 5 of the Sale of
Goods Act and submitted that in order to be a contract for sale there must be offer and acceptance.
In short his submission is that It must be a sale within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act. Mr.
Chowdhury referred to the decisions in Sales Tax Officer, Pilibhit v. Budh Prakash Jai Prakash A.I.R.
1964 S.C. 459, J.K. Jute Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of Uttar Pradesh A.I.R. 1961 S.C. 1534, Carl Still
G.m.b.H. v. State of Bihar A.I.R. 1961 S.C. 1615, George Oakes (P.) Ltd. v. State of Madras A.I.R.
1962 S.C. 1037, Bhopal Sugar Industries Ltd. v. D.P. Dube, Sales Tax Officer A.I.R. 1964 S.C. 1037,
Deputy Commercial Tax Officer, Saidapet, Madras v. Enfield India Ltd. Co-operative Canteen Ltd.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978164/ 10Commercial Tax Officer And Ors. vs Vishnu Agencies (P.) Ltd. on 13 December, 1974
A.I.R. 1968 S.C. 838, State of Maharashtra v. Champalal Kishanlal Mohta A.I.R. 1871 S.C. 908, in
addition to the decisions cited by Mr. Sengupta for the appellants. Mr. Chowdhury's submission was
that those Supreme Court decisions have laid down that in order to constitute "sale" which can be
taxed by any State Legislature, such "sale" must constitute a sale within the meaning of the Sale of
Goods Act. Mr. Chowdhury thereafter referred to the Defence of India Rules, Rule 81(2), Industries
(Development and Regulation) Act, 1951, Section 18G(2)(a), Essential Commodities Act, 1955,
Section 2, which are the various Acts dealt with by the Supreme Court in some of the said decisions
and submitted that the provisions of the West Bengal Cement Control Act, 1948, Section 3(2)(e), are
of the same pattern and conform to the same provisions as in the various Acts referred to by him.
Mr. Chowdhury also referred to Section 4 of the Sale of Goods Act which provides that there must be
an agreement for sale before a contract of sale can come into effect. And relying on those provisions
and decisions of the Supreme Court, Mr. Chowdhury submitted that any transfer of property in
goods for money pursuant to a statutory right to demand such goods and statutory obligations to
deliver them when demanded without any need of any offer or acceptance, expressed or implied, is
not a "sale" within the meaning of entry 48, List II of the Government of India Act, 1935, and entry
54 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India read with Section 4 of the Sale of
Goods Act. There must be offer to buy made by the purchaser to the seller or vice versa and there
must be acceptance of such offer by the respective parties, as the case may be ; they are the
essentials of a contract. When there is no requirement of the law to make an offer or to accept an
offer and the passing of property in the goods and there is only statutory rights and statutory
obligations and there being no offer and acceptance a compulsory sale is effected, it is not a sale at
all within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act as no freedom of contract to enter into an agreement
between the parties is left in the types of transactions which are involved in this appeal. Mr.
Chowdhury further submitted that if the amount of freedom which is left to the parties does not
relate to offer and acceptance, it is not freedom at all and cannot amount to a sale within the
meaning of the Sale of Goods Act. He strongly relied on the passages in Solar Jung Sugar Mills Ltd.
v. State of Mysore A.I.R. 1972 S.C. 87, paras 43 and 44. He submitted that in order to constitute an
agreement the parties must sign the same and offer and acceptance must be according to the free
will of the parties. Mr. Chowdhury submitted that the transactions which are the subject-matter of
this appeal are not sales but those are sales of a compulsory nature similar to transactions under the
Defence of India Rules, Essential Commodities Act, where there is a fixed price under the control
order and it is not a question of maximum or minimum price. He again relied on the line of the
Supreme Court decisions which have held that those transactions are not sales within the meaning
of the Sale of Goods Act and as such beyond the competency of the State Legislature to impose sales
tax on such transactions and, therefore, the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941, is not applicable
to those transactions as those are not voluntary sales pursuant to an agreement entered into
between the purchaser and the seller but a compulsory sale to a permit-holder under the said
control order. The respondent had no option but to deliver the goods at the fixed price within the
fixed time of fixed quantity. Mr. Chowdhury further highlighted the provisions for penalties in the
the said Cement Control Act in Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9 and submitted that those penal provisions
make it clear that the transactions in question are not sales under an agreement of sale but
compulsory sales. Mr. Chowdhury thereafter referred to the Supreme Court decision in New India
Sugar Mills Ltd. A.I.R. 1963 S.C. 1207, where the four conditions of sales have been laid down. Mr.
Chowdhury also referred to the decision in State of Tamil Nadu v. Cement Distributors A.I.R. 1973
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978164/ 11Commercial Tax Officer And Ors. vs Vishnu Agencies (P.) Ltd. on 13 December, 1974
S.C. 668, which arose out of the Cement Control Act in respect of sale of cement to State Trading
Corporation in gunny bags and it was held that those are not sales of cement including gunny bags.
Mr. Chowdhury again referred to the decision in Chittar Mal Narain Das v. Commissioner of Sales
Tax A.I.R. 1970 S.C. 2000, where the question arose whether under the U. P. Levy Order there was a
sale by the licensed dealer pursuant to an order to deliver the wheat under the said levy order.
Relying on those decisions in particular, Mr. Chowdhury submitted that the present transactions
also cannot be held to be "sales" within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act and as such are not
liable to sales tax under the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941.
14. Mr. R.C. Deb also appearing for the respondent submitted that in order to constitute a sale it
must precede by an agreement for sale. He referred to Sections 4 and 5 of the Sale of Goods Act,
1930, and contended that offer and acceptance must be there and the property in goods must pass.
But where there is any transfer of property in goods for money pursuant to statutory right to
demand such goods and such statutory obligations to deliver, such transaction is not a "sale" within
the meaning of entry 48 of List II of the Government of India Act, 1935, and entry 54 of List II of the
Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India read with Section 4 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. Mr.
Deb relied on Gannon Dunkerley & Co. {Madras) Ltd.'s series of cases A.I.R. 1958 S.C. 560. He
submitted that the transactions in question are compulsory sales and are not sales within the
meaning of the Sale of Goods Act. There is no amount of freedom left in these transactions as the
said Control Act does not provide that the transactions should not be entered into with offer and
acceptance; as such there is no sale. He submitted that in the present case the allotment order gives
no choice to the respondent and as such it cannot amount to sale. There is an obligation under the
Cement Control Act on the respondent to deliver ; in default penal consequences would visit the
respondent under the relevant provisions of the said Control Act. Mr. Deb submitted that there is no
volition left between the parties and as such there cannot be any contravention. He also referred to
the decisions in Chittar Mal Narain Das v. Commissioner of Sales Tax A.I.R. 1970 S.C. 2000, Salar
Jung Sugar Mills Ltd. v. State of Mysore A.I.R. 1972 S.C. 87 and the English Appeal Court decision
in Kirkness v. John Hudson & Co. Ltd. [1955] A.C. 696.
15. Mr. P.K. Sengupta in reply submitted that in these transactions there is an implied agreement
between the stockist and permit-holder of cement under the said Control Act and orders made
thereunder. He submitted that so far as the cement is concerned the stockist applies for licence
under the Control Act agreeing to sell cement under certain limited conditions as prescribed under
the terms of the licence and thereby offers cement for sale on those terms. The purchaser also agrees
to buy on certain terms cement from the seller by applying for a permit to the authorities under the
Cement Control Act. In such transactions, the controlling authorities under the said Cement Control
Act only acts as a conduit pipe for putting the seller and purchaser together and, as such, there is
offer and acceptance implied in such transactions to constitute a contract. He again submitted that
there is purchaser and seller and the controlling authority only controls the quantity and the
maximum price for equitable distribution to bona fide consumer of cement and prevent black
market. Mr. Sengupta finally summarised that there are enough volitions left to the parties in order
to enter into an agreement for sale and a contract for sale within the meaning of the Sale of Goods
Act. Those volitions are : (1) The maximum price is fixed but freedom to sell at a lower price than the
maximum price is not taken away and the parties can agree to any price below the maximum price.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978164/ 12Commercial Tax Officer And Ors. vs Vishnu Agencies (P.) Ltd. on 13 December, 1974
(2) Delivery can be taken at any time within 15 days from the date of the permit and the parties can
agree to take and give delivery by instalments and, as such, there is also a freedom in respect of the
same. (3) The price can be paid either by instalments and by cash or credit note as the parties may
agree between themselves. (4) Licence is taken by the stockist and dealer who is the seller agreeing
to offer for sale of cement and the permit-holder also agrees to purchase from the licensed stockist
and dealer of cement on the terms and conditions prescribed. Mr. Sengupta thereafter submitted
that the Controller merely controls the flow of cement for equitable and fair distribution at a
maximum price fixed for supply of cement which is in short supply. Therefore Mr. Sengupta
submitted that there is an implied contract between the seller and the buyer. (5) There is a transfer
of property in the goods by the agreement which is involved in these transactions. (6) The parties
are free to come through the Controller in respect of the said transactions for cement either to buy
cement or to sell cement according to their volitions, that is, the seller obtaining a licence for selling
cement within the limits and terms prescribed by the Control Act and the orders made thereunder
and the permit-holder also agrees to buy cement from the stockist and dealer of cement on the
terms prescribed under the said Act and the orders. Mr. Sengupta again referred to the decision in
Indian Steel and Wire Products Ltd. v. State of Madras A.I.R. 1968 S.C. 478, in support of his
contention and submitted that the transactions in question must be held to be sale within the
meaning of the Sale of Goods Act and liable to sales tax under the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act,
1941. He submitted that in the transactions, it cannot be said that there is no amount of volition left
with the parties to enter into the said transactions so as to take it out of an agreement for sale
resulting in a contract for sale as analysed before.
16. Considering the respective contentions very carefully it appears to us that the question involved
in this appeal has to be decided solely on the interpretation of the relevant provisions of the West
Bengal Cement Control Act, 1948, under which the respondent is a licensed stockist and dealer of
cement and also the licences for cement to consumers are issued under the said Act. It is now
well-settled by the catena of Supreme Court decisions cited by both the parties, particularly, the
decision in Gannon Dunkerley A.I.R. 1958 S.C. 560, that the State can only impose sales tax on
transactions which are "sales" within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act, that is, there must be an
agreement for sale followed by a contract for sale where all the four elements of sale formulated by
Benjamin on Sale and approved by the Supreme Court, viz., (1) parties competent to contract, (2)
mutual assent, (3) things, absolute or general property in which is transferred from the seller to the
buyer and (4) price in money paid or promised, are satisfied. Therefore, the question boils down to
this, that it has to be examined whether under the relevant provisions of the said Cement Control
Act, transactions of delivery of cement by a licensed stockist to a consumer, in whose favour licence
for cement has been issued under the said Act on the terms and conditions of the respective licences
of the stockists and the consumers, constitute "sale" within the meaning and conditions as laid down
by the Supreme Court in the said series of decisions. The relevant provisions of the said Cement
Control Act, and also the relevant terms and conditions of the licence issued to the stockist and the
consumers pursuant to their application to the prescribed authorities under the said Act have been
set out before.
17. It appears from the short title of the Act that it is for control of the transaction in cement in West
Bengal, and from the preamble it appears that the object of the Act is to confer powers on the State
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978164/ 13Commercial Tax Officer And Ors. vs Vishnu Agencies (P.) Ltd. on 13 December, 1974
Government to control the production, supply and distribution of, trade and commerce In, cement
in West Bengal. Section 1 gives the short title, extent and the date of commencement of the said Act
in West Bengal. Section 2 defines "cement". Sub-section (1) of Section 3 gives power to the State
Government to promulgate orders by publication in the official Gazette regarding regulation or
prohibition of the production, supply and distribution of, trade and commerce in, cement within the
State of West Bengal with a view to maintain or increase the supply of cement or in securing suitable
distribution and fair price. Sub-section (2) of Section 3 provides in addition to the general powers of
the State to promulgate orders for the purposes mentioned therein which, inter alia, included
regulating licences, permits or otherwise the production or manufacture of cement, fixing price at
which the cement may be purchased or sold and prescribing conditions for the sale thereof, also
regulation about storage, transport, movement, etc., and other relevant matters. Sub-section (3) of
Section 3 gives power of seizure of cement and proceedings under the Code of Civil Procedure.
Section 4 provides for power of delegation by the State Government to make order under Section 3
to such officers stated therein. Section 5 provides for overriding effect of orders made under Section
3 of the said Act. Section 6 provides for penalties which can be imposed on a person contravening
any order made under Section 3 of the said Act. Section 7 provides similar penalties to the person
aiding and abetting the contravention of any order under Section 3 of the said Act. Section 8 extends
the penalties for contravention of any order passed under Section 3 of the said Act to a company and
other body corporate, every director, manager, secretary or other officers or agents thereof on the
conditions prescribed therein. Section 9 provides that any person making any false statement or
information will become punishable under the said Act. Section 10 provides for the procedure for
cognizance of offences under the said Act. Section 12 of the said Act provides for imposition of fine
for contravention of an order under Section 3 of the said Act. Section 13 contains certain savings
under the said Act and Section 14 provides for protection to the officers and the State Government
against suit and other legal proceedings. Section 15 provides power to the State Government to
exempt any variety of cement from the provisions of the said Act. Section 16 continued any order or
direction or action taken under the West Bengal Cement Control Ordinance, 1948.
18. From the analysis of the provisions of the said Act it is abundantly clear that the scope and object
of the said Act is to control, inter alia, trade and commerce in cement in West Bengal which clearly
include sale and purchase of cement. It is true that the mere use of the word "sale" in Sub-section (2)
of Section 3 of the said Act would not make the transaction of delivery of cement pursuant to
licences and permits issued under the said Act a "sale" within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act,
ipso facto, unless the four elements as laid down by the Supreme Court to constitute a sale are
satisfied. But certainly when the legislature designedly and deliberately has used the word "sale"
particularly in Sub-section (2) of Section 3 of Clauses (b), (d), and (e), it must be given a meaning
and a legislative purpose. The said Act appears to be a comprehensive one and covering a wide range
regarding control over production and transactions in cement in West Bengal. The State
Government, if it appears to it necessary and expedient, can pass any order for the purposes and
object of the said Act which, inter alia, includes sale of cement by a licensed stockist to a consumer
to whom licence has been issued under the said Act. As it has already been laid down by the
Supreme Court through the said series of decisions mentioned hereinbefore in order to enable the
State Government to impose sales tax the transaction must be a "sale" of goods within the meaning
of the Sale of Goods Act as interpreted by the said decisions. In the instant case, it is an admitted
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978164/ 14Commercial Tax Officer And Ors. vs Vishnu Agencies (P.) Ltd. on 13 December, 1974
position that the respondent is a licensed stockist who has applied for licence under the said Control
Act to sell cement on the terms and conditions of the licence issued to it. The application form, the
relevant terms of which has been set out before, makes it abundantly clear that any person who is
agreeable on the conditions set out in the said licence issued to him, can sell cement to customers.
Relevant portion of clause 5 of the conditions of licence once again may be set out for convenience
sake at this stage :
The licensee shall issue to every customer a true cash memorandum or credit note, as
the case may be, giving his name, licence number and address, the date of the
transaction, the quantity sold, the rate at which sold, the number and date of the
written order under which sold and the salesman's signature....
19. There is no compulsion on anybody to apply for licence under the said Act for doing business in
cement. It is purely a voluntary act and any person is free to apply for such licence under the said
Act and licences would be issued to persons under the said Act provided the conditions are fulfilled.
Therefore, it appears that by applying for a licence under the said Act, a person voluntarily agrees to
do business in cement as a licensed stockist by complying, with the terms of the said Act regarding
sale of cement to customers to whom the licence for cement would be issued by the prescribed
authority under the said Act. Correspondingly any person who requires cement for his own
consumption or purpose may apply for issue of a licence for cement to the prescribed authority
under the said Act and also agrees to purchase cement from the licensed stockist under the said Act
under the terms and conditions prescribed therein. The said act of the customer who applies for
licence of cement is entirely voluntary and he is free to apply for required quantity of cement to the
prescribed authority under the said Act. Therefore, there seems to be an offer within the meaning of
the Contract Act by the consumer who is the purchaser of cement to the licensed stockist under the
said Act. Therefore, the first element to constitute a sale is satisfied. That is, there are parties
competent to contract in respect of purchase and sale of cement, viz., licensed stockist who offers
cement for sale on the terms and conditions of his licence issued under the said Act and the
customer in whose favour licence for cement has been issued under the said Act accepted the said
offer of the licensed stockist through the prescribed authorities under the said Act. Therefore, it
appears that the first element Is satisfied.
20. Now the second element constituting sale being the mutual consent of the parties seems to have
been satisfied in this case, as it cannot be said that there is any compulsion under the law to apply
under the said Act for a licence both on the part of the licensed stockist of cement and the
consumers of cement. What is prescribed is only a control of such contract which must comply with
the provisions of the said Act and order made thereunder. It cannot be said in the circumstances
that it is wholly controlled eliminating consent or volition of the parties altogether. A party who has
voluntarily and freely according to his sweet will and requirement applied under the Act for issue of
a licence as stockist or a consumer of cement agreeing to have dealings and transactions in purchase
and sale of cement under the terms and conditions of licences issued under the said Act. Therefore,
it must be held that there is no question of total elimination of volition or mutual consent of the
parties in the transaction of delivery of cement, as in this instant case, by the respondent to the
customer in whose favour the said licence for cement has been issued under the said Act. There is no
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978164/ 15Commercial Tax Officer And Ors. vs Vishnu Agencies (P.) Ltd. on 13 December, 1974
question about satisfying the third element to constitute a sale within the meaning of the Sale of
Goods Act, that is, transfer of property from the seller to the buyer. It is nobody's case that the
licensed stockist is not the owner of the said cement and as such by delivery of the said cement to
the customer holding a licence for cement which has been issued under the said Act against valuable
consideration which is fixed under the said licence, there is certainly a transfer of property in the
cement from the licensed stockist to the customer presenting the licence for cement under the said
Act to the licensed stockist. The fourth element being the price in money paid or promised is
satisfied as the price is mentioned in the licence itself which is issued in favour of the customer and
there is no dispute that the same has been paid to the licensed stockist. Reference may also be made
to the licence for cement, which is annexed to the paper book and set out before, that the price of
cement mentioned therein excludes sales tax, indicating that sales tax is payable and can be charged
by respondent No. 1, according to the provisions of the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941, under
which respondent No. 1 is a registered dealer.
21. The general scheme of promulgating orders under the provisions of the Defence of India Act,
Essential Commodities Act, and the various control orders seems to be more or less on similar lines
and for common objects of regulating, inter alia, supply, trade and commerce, manufacture,
distribution, etc., of various goods. The necessity of passing an order under the said Act depends on
the circumstances and conditions at different stages and places as the Central Government or the
State Government may think necessary to cope with the situation and problem which may arise
from time to time. In the interest of the country's development this type of Orders has become
necessary, inter alia, for regulation of community life and commerce.
22. As it has been observed a transaction on which sales tax can be imposed by a State Government
must amount to a sale within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. What amounts to such
sale has been clearly laid down by the series of Supreme Court decisions which have been referred to
by both the parties and have been summarised before. It has been further laid down that the
transactions like forward contract, claim for damages, supply of refreshment to members of a club
or a co-operative society, consumption by the owner of goods and compulsory acquisitions of goods
are not "sales" within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act.
23. It is needless for us to discuss and consider all the decisions cited at the Bar, as from the facts of
this case and on the analysis of the scope and object of the West Bengal Cement Control Act, 1948,
enumerated hereinbefore, it is abundantly clear that the transaction involved in the supply of
cement by the respondent as a licensed stockist under the said Cement Control Act and a registered
dealer under the Bengal Finance (Sales Tax) Act by supplying cement to the holder of licence for
cement, being the consumers and customers, is certainly a sale within the meaning of the Sale of
Goods Act. It is immaterial that there are provisions for penalty and prosecution for non-compliance
of the provisions of the said Cement Control Orders and the terms of the licence by the parties
having dealings and transactions under the said Act. What is material is whether the transaction
amounts to "sale" within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act or not, The principle to be applied in
the present case having regard to the facts and the scope and object of the Cement Control Act
seems to have been well-established by the four decisions of the Supreme Court, being those in
Indian Steel and Wire Products Ltd. v. State of Madras A.I.R. 1968 S.C. 478, Andhra Sugars Ltd. v.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978164/ 16Commercial Tax Officer And Ors. vs Vishnu Agencies (P.) Ltd. on 13 December, 1974
State of Andhra Pradesh A.I.R. 1968 S.C. 599, State of Rajasthan v. Karam Chand Thappar and
Brothers (Coal Sales) Ltd. A.I.R. 1969 S.C. 343 and Salar Jung Sugar Mills Ltd. v. State of Mysore
A.I.R. 1972 S C.87.
24. All the decisions which were relied on by the respondent are mostly cases of compulsory
acquistions or transactions which do not amount to "sale" under the Sale of Goods Act. Particularly
the decision in New India Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, Bihar A.I.R. 1983 S.C.
1207, which acted as a source of revelation and inspiration to the respondent of its legal right to
challenge the decisions of the sales tax authorities imposing sales tax on the said transactions of
supply of cement to licence-holders by the respondent, is a clear case of compulsory acquisition of
goods under the Sugar and Sugar Products Control Order, 1946. Therefore, all the decisions relied
on by the respondent are decided on the peculiar facts of such particular case and have no
application to the present case.
25. The decision in Andhra Sugars Ltd. v. State of Andhra Pradesh A.I.R. 1968 S.C. 599 arose out of
a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution before the Supreme Court, where the vires of
Section 21 of the Andhra Pradesh Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act, 1961, was
challenged. After considering, inter alia, the relevant provisions of the Sale of Goods Act and the
Contract Act, the Supreme Court held as follows :
Now, under Act No. 45 of 1961 and the Rules framed under it, the cane-grower in the
factory zone is free to make or not to make an offer of sale of cane to the occupier of
the factory. But, if he makes an offer, the occupier of the factory is bound to accept it.
The resulting agreement is recorded in writing and is signed by the parties. The
consent of the occupier of the factory to the agreement is not caused by coercion,
undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake. His consent is free as defined
in Section 14 of the Indian Contract Act though he is obliged by law to enter into the
agreement. The compulsion of law is not coercion as defined in Section 15 of the Act.
In spite of the compulsion, the agreement is neither void nor voidable. In the eye of
the law, the agreement is freely made. The parties are competent to contract. The
agreement is made for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object and is not void
under any provisions of law. The agreements are enforceable by law and are contracts
of sale of sugarcane as defined in Section 4 of the Indian Sale of Goods Act. The
purchases of sugarcane under the agreement can be taxed by the State Legislature
under entry 54, List II.
26. In that decision, it was observed that in Kirkness v. John Hudson and Co. Ltd. [1955] A.C. 696
and New India Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, Bihar A.I.R. 1963 S.C. 1207, on the
special facts of those cases the transactions were not "sales" as no contract resulted and those
decisions are not treated as an authority for the proposition that "there can be no contract of sale
under compulsion of a statute. It depends upon the facts of each case and the terms of the particular
statute regulating the dealings whether the parties have entered into a contract of sale of goods". In
the said decision, the Supreme Court held that cane-grower makes an offer to the occupier of the
factory directly and the latter accepts the offer. The parties then make and sign an agreement in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978164/ 17Commercial Tax Officer And Ors. vs Vishnu Agencies (P.) Ltd. on 13 December, 1974
writing. There is thus a direct privity of contract between the parties. The contract is a contract of
sale and purchase of cane, though the buyer is obliged to give his assent under compulsion of a
statute. The State Legislature is competent to tax purchases of canes made by such a contract.
27. In the Supreme Court decision in Indian Steel and Wire Products Ltd. v. State of Madras A.I.R.
1968 S.C. 478, the appellant contested the right of the State of Madras to levy tax on the turnover of
supply of certain steel products by it to various persons in the State of Madras on the basis that the
said transactions were not "sales" and were made under compulsion of law and as such there was no
agreement between the appellant and the parties to whom the goods were delivered pursuant to the
order of the Steel Controller exercising powers under the Iron and Steel (Control of Production and
Distribution) Order, 1941, issued under the Defence of India Act, 1939. In that case also, similar
argument as advanced in this case was also made before the Supreme Court, i e., "that every facet of
those transactions were prescribed by the Controller and therefore those transactions cannot be
considered as 'sales' on the basis of the said decisions in Kirkness v. John Hudson & Co. Ltd. (3)
[1965] A.C. 696, New India Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Sales Tax A.I.R. 1963 S.C. 1207 and
other decisions. In the said decision, the Supreme Court analysed the correspondence between the
parties acquiring the iron and steel products, the Controller and the appellant-company, and also
the relevant provisions of the said Iron and Steel Control Order and held that from the materials all
that could be gathered is that the Controller fixed the base price of steel products and determined
the buyers. In other respects, the parties were free to decide their own terms by consent. The
appellant could supply the goods in question at its convenience. It was open to the appellant to agree
with its customers as to the date on which the goods were to be supplied. It was also open to the
appellant to fix the time and mode of payment of the price of the goods supplied. Therefore, It was
held that the transactions were not completely regulated and controlled by the Controller leaving no
room for mutual assent. It was also held that the said Control Order reduced the area within which
there can be bargaining between a prospective buyer and an intending seller of steel products. Both
of them have to conform to the requirements of the order and to comply with the terms and
conditions contained in the order of the Controller. Therefore, they could negotiate only in respect
of matters not controlled by the order or prescribed by the Controller. That does not mean that there
is no freedom to contract. The concept of freedom of contract has undergone a great deal of change
even in those countries where it was considered as one of the basic economic requirements of a
democratic life. Full freedom to contract was never there at any time. Law invariably imposed some
restrictions on freedom to contract. But due to change in political outlook and as a result of
economic compulsions, the freedom to contract is now being confined gradually to narrower and
narrower limits : see Indian Steel and Wire Products Ltd. v. State of Madras A.I.R. 1968 S.C. 478 at
484-485 (paras 10, 11), 487.
28. The Supreme Court further observed in that case that "it would be incorrect to contend that
because law imposes some restrictions on freedom to contract, there is no contract at all. So long as
mutual assent is not completely excluded in any dealing, in law it is a contract" : see Indian Steel
and Wire Proudcts Ltd. v. State of Madras A.I.R. 1968 S.C. 478 at 484-485 (paras 10, 11), 487.
29. It was also held by the Supreme Court that the Controller's directions were confined to narrow
limits and there were several matters which the parties could decide by mutual assent. The Supreme
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978164/ 18Commercial Tax Officer And Ors. vs Vishnu Agencies (P.) Ltd. on 13 December, 1974
Court finally concluded in Indian Steel and Wire Products Ltd. v. State of Madras A.I.R. 1968 S.C.
478 at 484-485 (paras 10, 11), 487 "that the the transactions were those of sales as out of four
elements to constitute a sale three were admittedly established, namely, the parties were competent
to contract, the property in the goods was transferred from the seller to the buyer and price in
money was paid. The only controversy was whether there was mutual assent, and the finding was
that there was mutual assent in several respects and the transaction was that of sale". It appears to
us that the said decision is in all fours with the present case before us under the West Bengal
Cement Control Act, 1948.
30. In the decision in State of Rajasthan v. Karam Chand Thappar and Brothers (Coal Sales) Ltd.
A.I.R. 1969 S.C. 343 at 345, para 7, the Supreme Court was dealing with the provisions of the
Colliery Control Order, 1945, in a writ petition for quashing an order of assessment.
31. The Supreme Court after analysing the provisions of the Colliery Control Order which may be
said to have analogous provisions like that of the present Cement Control Act before us observed in
State of Rajasthan v. Karam Chand Thappar and Brothers (Coal Sales) Ltd. A.I.R. 1969 S.C. 343 at
345, para 7, as follows:
Under the Colliery Control Order, coal may be supplied under directions issued by
the Central Government upon the colliery owner to any person without an
agreement, express or implied, between the colliery owner and such other person :
coal may also be supplied under a contract between the colliery (sic) to a purchaser at
the price fixed by the Central Government. In the present case, there was between the
State of Rajasthan and the assessee acting as an agent of the Equitable Coal Company
an agreement to sell coal. The price chargeable was fixed under the Colliery Control
Order. The effect of the Control Order was only to superimpose upon the agreement
between the parties the rate fixed under the Order. But on that account it cannot be
said that the relation between the supplier and the person to whom the coal was
supplied was not contractual. The contract between the parties was only modified by
the statutory provisions.
32. In dealing with New India Sugar Mills Ltd.'s case A.I.R. 1963 S.C. 1207, the Supreme Court
observed that when goods, supply of which was controlled by statutory orders, are delivered
pursuant to contract of sale, the principles of the decision in New India Sugar Mills Ltd.'s case A.I.R.
1963 S.C. 1207 had no application.
33. The latest Supreme Court decision is Salar Jung Sugar Mills Ltd. v. State of Mysore A.I.R. 1972
S.C. 87 at 98, para. 38, where in a writ petition the question arose whether there was a purchase or
sale of sugarcane arising under the Mysore Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply) Order, 1963, which
was passed in exercise of powers conferred by Section 3 of the Defence of India Act, 1962, and Rule
125-B of the Defence of India "Rules, 1962. The Supreme Court after analysing the relevant
provisions of the Act and the Order and the decision cited, Ray, J. (as he then was), observed as
follows :

These decisions establish that statutory orders regulating the supply and distribution
of goods by and between the parties under Control Orders in a State do not absolutely
impinge on the freedom to enter into contract. Legislative measures or statutory
provisions fixing the price, delivery, supply, restricting areas for transactions are all
within the realm of planning economic needs ensuring production and distribution of
essential commodities and basic necessities of community....The individual freedom
is to be reconciled with adequate performance by the Government of its functions in a
highly organised society. Delimiting areas for transactions or parties or denoting
price for transactions are all within the area of individual freedom of contract with
limited choice by reason of ensuring the greatest good for the greatest number by
achieving proper supply at standard or fair price to eliminate the evils of hoarding
and scarcity on the one hand and availability on the other.
34. In that case, it was held that the transaction was a sale and sales tax was leviable.
35. Applying those principles to the facts of this case there cannot be any doubt that all the four
elements required for constituting a "sale" within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act are present
in the transactions between the respondent as licensed stockist and the customers holding licence
for cement under the West Bengal Cement Control Act, 1948. There are parties competent to
contract and, as such, the first condition is satisfied. Mutual assent of the parties is not totally
excluded regarding the time for payment, mode of payment, price below the maximum price fixed,
place of delivery, quantities for delivery, time for delivery, charges for delivery and the packing.
Therefore, mutual assent is not totally excluded and as such the second condition is also satisfied.
There is no dispute that the respondent is the owner of the cement which is delivered to the
customers holding a permit to whom the property passes on the terms and conditions as to payment
to the respondent. As such the third condition Is also satisfied. There is no dispute that the money
for the price of the said quantities of cement have been: paid by the customers to respondent No. 1
and, as such, the fourth condition is also satisfied. In fact the respondent charged sales tax and
realised the same from the customers.
36. It is true that there is no separate writing evidencing an agreement for sale or a contract for sale,
at least nothing has been disclosed by the parties, but a contract can be expressed or implied and, in
the facts and circumstances of this case, presenting the licence for cement by the customer to the
licensed stockist being the respondent and his acceptance of the same by supplying cement and
receiving payment of the price mentioned therein, clearly constitute a contract for sale within the
meaning of the Sale of Goods Act read with the Contract Act.
37. The Supreme Court in a recent decision in Instalment Supply Ltd. v. Sales Tax Officer,
Ahmedabad A.I.R. 1974 S.C. 1105 at 1108, para 6, while dealing with the question as to when a ''sale"
liable to sales tax takes place under a hire-purchase agreement laid down the legal incidence of a
"sale". After setting out Section 4 of the Sale of Goods Act, Alagiriswami, J., observed as follows :
The definition is the same as in the English Sale of Goods Act, 1893. The points to be
noticed are that the essence of sale is the transfer of the property in a thing from one
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978164/ 20Commercial Tax Officer And Ors. vs Vishnu Agencies (P.) Ltd. on 13 December, 1974
person to another for a price. The terms 'contract of sale' includes an agreement to
sell. An agreement to sell is known as an executory contract of sale, while a sale is
known as an executed contract of sale. The term 'contract of sale' thus includes both
actual sales and agreements for sale. It is important to distinguish clearly between the
two classes of contract. An agreement to sell is a contract, pure and simple, whereas a
sale is a contract plus a conveyance. By an agreement to sell a jus in personam is
created, by a sale a jus in rem also is transferred. Where goods have been sold and the
buyer makes default, the seller may sue for the contract price on the count of 'goods
bargained and sold', but where an agreement to buy is broken, the seller's normal
remedy is an action for unliquidated damages. If an agreement to sell be broken by
the seller, the buyer has only a personal remedy against the seller. The goods are still
the property of the seller, and he can dispose of them as he likes. But if there has been
a sale, and the seller breaks his engagement to deliver the goods, the buyer has not
only a personal remedy against the seller, but also the usual proprietary remedies in
respect of the goods themselves. In many cases, too, he can follow the goods into the
hands of third parties. Again, if there be an agreement for sale, and the goods are
destroyed, the loss as a rule falls on the seller, while if there has been a sale, the loss
as a rule falls upon the buyer though the goods have never come into his possession.
38. The above legal proposition describing the incidence of a "sale" makes it clear that the essence of
a sale is the transfer of a property in the goods from one person to another for a price and a sale is a
contract plus a conveyance. In the instant case before us, as has been analysed before, while
examining the question as to whether it satisfies the four elements of sale, it must be held that the
property in the goods has passed from one person to another for a price and there is a contract plus
conveyance. The said Cement Control Act only imposes certain conditions on such sales for
attaining the scope and object of the said Act in respect of equitable distribution of cement at a fair
price, to prevent black market and ensure fair and equitable distribution of cement at a fair price in
the State of West Bengal.
39. The sole and only contention exhaustively argued on behalf of the respondent is that there was
no volition on the part of the respondent but to accept the permit for cement of the customer and
supply the goods on the terms and conditions of the respective licences issued under the said
Cement Control Act. In short, there was no consensus between the parties which has been
voluntarily arrived at. As has been laid down in the Supreme Court decisions discussed above,
unless the transaction amounts to compulsory acquisition of property, which completely eliminates
all the four element of sale, there may be sale even under compulsion or when the terms of such
sales are controlled by legislation for the purpose and object laid down therein. The identical
question came up before the Supreme Court in relation to a case under the Prevention of Food
Adulteration Act, 1954, where a dealer of spices was convicted after a Food Inspector purchased a
sample of the goods from him under the provisions of the said Act and the question arose whether
the sale under the compulsion of the said Act was a "sale". In the said decision in Mangaldas
Raghavji Ruparel v. State of Maharashtra A.I.R. 1966 S.C. 128 at 134-135, para. 18, Mudholkar, J.,
observed :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978164/ 21Commercial Tax Officer And Ors. vs Vishnu Agencies (P.) Ltd. on 13 December, 1974
No doubt a contract comes into existence by the acceptance of a proposal made by
one person to another by that other person. That other person is not bound to accept
the proposal but it may not necessarily follow that where that other person had no
choice but to accept the proposal the transaction would never amount to a contract.
40. The said observation also makes it clear that it is the scope, object and intention of a particular
Act under which a transaction takes place as to whether that would amount to a "sale" within the
meaning of the Sale of Goods Act as laid down by the various decisions of the Supreme Court
referred to above. Sale under compulsion of, or under the control of, a statutory authority laying
down statutory terms which would be incorporated in the contract for sale would not take such
transaction out of the definition of "sale" within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act as laid down
by the aforesaid decisions of the Supreme Court. It is only when the transaction amounts to
compulsory acquisition of property by an order of a statutory authority under any Act, that the
transaction would not be a 'sale'.
41. From any view of the matter the transactions which are involved in this appeal are undoubtedly
''sales" within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act as has been already held by us hereinbefore.
42. In view of the above, we cannot but hold that the transactions in question are "sales" within the
meaning of the Sale of Goods Act and the assessment orders imposing sales tax under the Bengal
Finance (Sales Tax) Act, 1941, on the transactions are valid, legal and within the jurisdiction of the
sales tax authorities.
43. In the result, the appeal is allowed. The rule is discharged and all interim orders vacated. No
order as to costs.
S.P. Mitra, C.J.
44. I agree.
