M.B. SHAH, J. PRESIDENT The question in this petition is: Whether the consumers/purchasers
of ornaments of precious metal (gold) should be left at the mercy of the traders who according to
Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) report, sell 90% of articles which are not in conformity with the
purity declared in the bills /cash memos? This is stated on affidavit filed on behalf of the BIS.
Imagine the situation where the cash memos do not mention anything about purity! The amount
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/297128/ 4Akhil Bhartiya Upbhokta ... vs M/S.Aggarwal Jewellers,Mr.Ajay ... on 12 December, 2005
involved in the dispute is very small, but the matter raises a vital question with regard to purity of
ornaments of a precious metal (gold). Petitioner- Akhil Bhartiya Upbhokta Congress, a Registered
Consumer Organization (Madhya Pradesh), has raised important questions with regard to the right
of consumers in regard to sale and purchase of gold ornaments. It is contended that under
Consumer Protection Act, 1986, consumers have
(i) the right to be informed about the quality, quantity, potency, purity, standard and price of goods
to protect the consumer against unfair trade practice; (ii) the right to be heard and to be assured
that consumers interests will receive due consideration at appropriate forums; and (iii) the right to
seek redressal against unfair trade practices or unscrupulous exploitation of consumers.
It is contended that unless there is a proper trade direction to declare the purity/quality of the
ornaments, illiterate or literate consumers are bound to be exploited and there is large scale
exploitation in such trade/business. Business in precious metal is increasing day by day and the
consumers are exploited to the fullest extent.
Considering the importance of the issue involved and its wide spread impact, notices were issued to
the (i) Union of India, (ii) Reserve Bank of India and (iii) Director General, Bureau of Indian
Standards, to find out any reasonable method for protecting the consumers, who customarily and
traditionally purchase the golden ornaments.
Affidavit by Reserve Bank of India.
On behalf of the Reserve
Bank of India, an affidavit is filed by
the General Manager in the Reserve Bank of India, Department of External Investments Operations,
Central Office, Mumbai, wherein it is stated that Reserve Bank of India has set up a Standing
Committee on Gold and Precious Metals under the chairmanship of an Executive Director and
comprising Chief General Manager of Department of External Investments and Operations (DEIO),
Department of Banking Operations and Development (DBOD), Exchange Control Department
(ECD) (recently renamed as Foreign Exchange Department (FED), an official each from the
Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Finance, to deliberate and advise the Government on
emerging issues pertaining to gold and precious metals. The Standing Committee recommended
that an organization with the relevant infrastructure and competence should monitor and control
the purity of gold jewellery sold in India. As a result, in January 1999, the BIS was designated by the
Government of India as the agency to evolve and operate the hallmarking scheme for gold jewellery.
The BIS launched the hallmarking scheme for gold jewellery on 11th April 2000. The main objective
of the hallmarking scheme for gold is to protect the public against the fraud of adulteration and low
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/297128/ 5Akhil Bhartiya Upbhokta ... vs M/S.Aggarwal Jewellers,Mr.Ajay ... on 12 December, 2005
caratage and to make manufacturers maintain standards for fineness and purity. It is also pointed
out that although the hallmarking scheme has made some headway, it was felt that the consumer
awareness level need to be improved and the Committee set up under the Chairmanship of the
Secretary (Ministry of Consumer Affairs) to examine the ways and means of securing consumer
interest in the marketing of gold products.
Affidavit by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).
An affidavit has been filed by Mr.A.S. Jamkhindikar, who is working as Scientist E & Director with
Bureau of Indian Standards, wherein, he has, inter alia stated that :
a) The Bureau of Indian Standards [BIS] is a body corporate constituted under the BIS Act,
1986, for harmonious development of the activities of standardization, marking and quality
certification of goods and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. As such the
functions of the Bureau are, inter alia, to establish, publish and promote in such manner as may be
prescribed, the Indian Standard, in relation to any article or process. Most of these standards are
voluntary in nature, whereas, the Central Government can, after consulting the Bureau, in the public
interest, and by publication in the Official Gazette, notify any article or process, by way of
mandatory requirement, to conform to the Indian Standard, failing which penal consequences as
provided under the BIS Act, would automatically follow.
b) The Bureau has so far established more than 17,000 Indian Standards, out of which only
approximately 100 standards are mandatory under various enactments and Government orders. As
far as Hallmarking of Gold Jewellery is concerned, the same is optional. The BIS Precious Metal
Sectional Committee (MTD 10) has formulated and published the following Indian Standards on
Gold and Gold Alloys :
1. IS1417 Grades of Gold and Gold Alloys, Jewellery / Artefacts Fineness and Marking.
2. IS 1418 Assaying Gold in Gold Bullion, Gold alloys and Gold Jewellery/Artefacts Cupellation (Fire
Assay Method).
3. IS 2790 Guidelines for manufacture of 23, 22, 21, 18, 14 and 9 carat gold alloys.
4. IS 3095 Gold solders for use in manufacture of jewellery.
c) At this stage it is worth mentioning that the role and functions of the Bureau under the
BIS Act 1986 as an enforcement agency, are extremely limited to misuse of the Indian Standard
Mark under Section 11, misuse of the name of the Bureau under Section 12, failure to comply with
the mandatory requirement of Indian Standard and Mark under Section 14, and breach of the terms
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/297128/ 6Akhil Bhartiya Upbhokta ... vs M/S.Aggarwal Jewellers,Mr.Ajay ... on 12 December, 2005
and conditions of licence under Section 15, of the BIS Act. Hence I do not admit the contention of
the learned Amicus Curie as reproduced in the order dated 28.04.2004 of this Honble Commission
that it was the function of the Bureau to provide for necessary rules and regulations so that the
consumers are not exploited by the traders by selling ornaments without disclosing its purity. In fact
the Bureau neither has the powers to formulate any rules or regulations, or the enforcement
machinery or infrastructure to carry out any search and seizure operations, investigations, arrests,
recording of statements of witnesses etc. as are conferred on law enforcing machinery of the State
such as the Police force, except to the limited extent of carrying out inspections and seizures as
provided under the Act, for which also the Bureaus Inspecting Officers have to rely heavily on
assistance from the Police.
d) The Bureau had in press release, marked Annexure E to the Submissions of the Amicus
Curiae, referred to the Convention on the Control and marking of Articles of Precious Metals signed
in 1972 by some of the European countries (with some other European countries as observers apart
from Canada). The objective of the Convention signed in Vienna by the European countries was to
facilitate trade in precious metal articles while at the same time maintaining fair trade and
consumer protection justified by the particular nature of these articles. For that purpose a Common
Control Marks (CCM) indicating fineness, was introduced.
Each member country agreed to allow goods marked with CCM to be imported without further
testing and marketing if such articles would normally qualify for a domestic market.
e) The Convention thus introduced the first international hallmark ever. It enabled national
assay offices of the signatory countries to apply for a Common Control Mark (CCM) to articles of
gold, silver and platinum after they have tested the fineness of the alloys used in the articles.
However, the marking of articles of precious metals with the CCM is carried out on a voluntary
basis. Compulsory hallmarking is not required from the contracting States to the Convention.
The purpose of the Convention was thus primarily to facilitate free trade in the precious metals and
articles made there from between member countries, on account of the fact that earlier, different
European legislations on precious metals control hampered the cross border trade seriously.
f) Government of India launched the Gold Bond Scheme in 1993. Almost concurrently, a
Committee within the RBI made a comprehensive set of recommendations for an integrated
national gold policy. One of the recommendations of the Committee was that hallmarking of gold
jewellery should be introduced in the country at the earliest as a measure of consumer protection.
The Standing Committee on Gold and Precious Metals in RBI, which is chaired by the Governor,
RBI and has participation from Ministries of Finance and Commerce of the Government of India, in
its 9th meeting held in January 1999 at Mumbai, identified Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) as the
sole agency in India to operate Hallmarking Scheme of Gold Jewellery.
g) Bureau of Indian Standards, launched its long term scheme in Hallmarking to encourage
the voluntary hallmarking of gold jewellery in April 2000. Known as BIS Certification Scheme for
Hallmarking of Gold Jewellery, it is backed by Reserve Bank of India, with four declared objectives,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/297128/ 7Akhil Bhartiya Upbhokta ... vs M/S.Aggarwal Jewellers,Mr.Ajay ... on 12 December, 2005
namely -
1. Protection of the consumer against irregular gold quality;
2. Support for export of gold jewellery;
3. Development of gold based financial products to assist in mobilizing dormant gold reserves in
private hands;
and
4. Development of India as a reliable gold market center commensurate with its status as the
words largest national gold market.
h) BIS Hallmarking scheme is based on the technical criteria set by the international
Convention on the Control and Marking of Articles of Precious Metals (Vienna Convention, 1972),
though India is not a contracting party to the Vienna Convention. The scheme is voluntary, and
there is no obligation on Certified Jewellers to hallmark all the gold jewellery that they retail,
fabricate or wholesale. The BIS Scheme involves the recognition of independent entities and
organizations to act as Assaying and Hallmarking Centres, and the certified jewellers who can use
the centers for hallmarking purposes. During the last four years BIS has recognized 17 Hallmarking
centers (in 10 cities) and certified over 750 Jewellers.
Although most Certified Jewellers are retailers, manufactures and wholesalers are also certified.
Plain gold Jewellery has been hallmarked since June 2000, and gold jewellery incorporating
diamonds since September 2001.
i) In the latter half of 2001/ beginning of 2002, the Bureau jointly with reputed consumer
organizations, carried out a general market survey in 8 major cities in India, and purchased
jewellery articles from 15 jewellers in each city, and sent the same for testing at the MMTC Assaying
Centre, New Delhi. Out of total 120 samples, only 14 confirmed to the purity declared by the
Jeweller in the bills/cash memos issued to the official of the Bureau who had purchased the
jewellery article, posing as an ordinary consumer.
The Bureau in the circumstances, filed complaints initially against 31 Jewellers spread all over the
country in whose cases the purity was short by more than 15% of the declared caratage, before the
MRTP Commission, New Delhi which took cognizance of the complaints and issued notices to the
concerned Jewellers.
To contain and control the alarming situation in the jewellery trade in the country, the Government
of India, Ministry of Consumer Affairs constituted a Committee, which had held its meeting on
22.09.2003 when it was decided to collect data on various aspects. The Terms of Reference are as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/297128/ 8Akhil Bhartiya Upbhokta ... vs M/S.Aggarwal Jewellers,Mr.Ajay ... on 12 December, 2005
under:
(i) Ways and Means to cover the gold jewellery transacted in Rural Areas which may be around
60-70% of the total trade.
(ii) Creation of infrastructure with respect to availability of Hallmarking Centres at least one in each
City/District of the country (as compared to 17 centres throughout the country at present)
(iii) Appropriate legislation under which Hallmarking can be made mandatory, if so required.
(iv) Identification of suitable enforcing/implementing Agency in the country.
(v) Incentives for encouraging Jewellers to join the Hallmarking Scheme.
(vi) Ways and means of bringing consumer awareness about benefits of purchasing hallmarked
jewellery.
Further, in the report of dated 13.4.2004 of Bureau of Indian Standards, it is stated that :
Culturally, the Indian people have a great fascination for gold. It should be recognized that in India,
in common with other Asian Countries, gold has a very important role in our cultural heritage. Gold
is considered as a commodity, and not a product. Any form of gold is equal to any other form of
gold. It is viewed to be homogenous and indistinguishable, having no brand or expiry date. As a
result, gold demand is not price-elastic. Rather it is prosperity elastic that is, increments in
household income are generally matched by purchases of more gold.
It is further stated that the Indian consumer is very often a victim of irregular metal quality. A
buyer, for instance, will be told that he has bought gold of 22 carats. When he goes to sell or
exchange it, he discovers that the gold is actually only of 18 carats and many customers have lost
money in this way. In India the emphasis is on high caratage jewellery. It has been further stated
that on taking cognizance of these aspects the RBI Standing Committee on Gold and Precious
Metals opined that introduction of a Hallmarking System would not only protect the public from
fraud, but also assist exports of jewellery. There is a reference to Convention on the Control and
Marking of Articles of Precious Metals singed 1972 by number of countries. The objective of the
convention was to facilitate trade in precious metal articles while at the same time maintaining fair
trade and consumer protection justified by the particular nature of these articles.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/297128/ 9Akhil Bhartiya Upbhokta ... vs M/S.Aggarwal Jewellers,Mr.Ajay ... on 12 December, 2005
Submissions There is no other affidavit filed on behalf of the Union of India. Mr. Jos Chiramel, the
learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Union of India submitted that under the Consumer
Protection Act, the Commission cannot give direction to the Central Government to have
hallmarking or direct the Central Government to frame rules so as to control irregular business in
the precious metal.
As against this, Mr. M.S. Ganesh, the learned Senior Counsel submitted that under the Consumer
Protection Act, any voluntary consumer association registered under the Companies Act, 1956
[Section 2(b)ii], is entitled to file a complaint; and the complaint can be, inter alia, for unfair trade
practice [Section 2(c)(i)]. Therefore, appropriate relief is required to be granted.
Findings Affidavits filed on behalf of the BIS and the RBI in terms reveal that the hallmarking of the
gold jewellery to protect the consumers is the necessity. However, there are various difficulties with
regard to the introduction of hallmarking. The highlighted portion reveals that out of 120 samples of
gold ornaments, only 14 conformed to the purity declared by the jeweller in the bills/cash memos
issued to the official of the Bureau who had purchased the jewellery articles posing as an ordinary
consumer. If this is the position it certainly indicates that approximately 90% of the jewellery sold is
not as per the specification mentioned in the cash memo or the bill. If that is the situation one has to
imagine what would be the fate of the ordinary consumers who are spread over all the country, and,
who as a matter of customarily practice or for investment purposes, purchase golden ornaments.
It is also submitted that a Committee within the RBI made a comprehensive set of recommendations
which included that hallmarking of gold jewellery should be introduced in the country at the earliest
as a measure of consumer protection. Bureau of Indian Standards has also launched a scheme for
voluntary hallmarking so as to protect consumers against irregular trade in golden ornaments and
as a support for export of gold jewellery. This was also in recognition of the fact that India was a
reliable gold market center for export also.
Despite this, it was pointed out that it was not possible to have the hallmarking mandatory without
the required infrastructure. It was also suggested that in such cases, action under Consumer
Protection Act, 1986, can be initiated against the seller if the purity of the ornament purchased by
the consumer is not of the same purity/standard as is mentioned in the bill. However, it is admitted
that considering the alarming state of affairs throughout the country with regard to false
representation/misrepresentation and other unfair trade practices indulged in by jewelers,
consumer is at a disadvantage, but the powers, functions and jurisdiction of the Fora under the
Consumer Protection Act, 1986 to deal with the nature of the case, may be clarified by a detailed and
exhaustive order.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/297128/ 10Akhil Bhartiya Upbhokta ... vs M/S.Aggarwal Jewellers,Mr.Ajay ... on 12 December, 2005
From the statements made in the affidavit filed on behalf of the Government it is apparent that a
large scale unfair trade practice in sale or purchase of precious jewellery is prevailing. Consumers
are at the mercy of the jewelers. It is for the Government to protect such consumers. One of the
main objectives of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, is to see that consumer gets information with
regard to quality, quantity, potency, purity, standard and price of the goods. This object of the Act is
apparently frustrated. There may be some difficulties with regard to hallmarking. But, there cannot
be any difficulty in issuing directions or notifications, for the time being, till the hallmarking is made
compulsory, to the jewelers/gold-smiths to embsoss a mark indicating fineness of the ornament.
This would give an opportunity to the consumer to know its purity. Subsequently, at the time of sale
or return of such ornaments, the consumer can bargain the repurchase price on the basis of purity
mentioned thereon. Further, if the ornament is not of the same purity/quality as per the mark, then
it becomes easy for the Consumer Fora to pass appropriate order. Undoubtedly, it is for the
Government to see that the rights conferred under the Consumer Protection Act are not made
illusory.
However, we accept the contention of the learned counsel for the Union of India that reliefs, which
can be granted under the provisions of Section 14 of the Act, are limited. No doubt Section 14(f)
empowers the Fora to issue an order directing the opposite party to discontinue unfair trade
practice, but it would be difficult for us to grant such relief in general terms. Hence the same is not
granted.
In this view of the matter we only observe that it is for the Government to protect the consumers and
we, at this stage, would not pass any order in general terms as prayed for. We accept the contention
that we are having limited jurisdiction. Hence, we leave it to the discretion of the Government to
take appropriate action so as to give relief to the consumers as a whole and not to leave them to be
victims of unfair trade practice. We add that for various reasons simplicitor awareness on the part of
the consumer may not serve any purpose, and, in most of the cases, consumers, for various
difficulties, are avoiding to approach the Consumer Fora.
Findings on Facts:
The case of the complainant is that he had paid Rs.2,700/- on 16.12.1997 for purchasing a gold ring
having purity of 23 carat. For that purpose, respondent jeweller had issued a cash memo. However,
on the cash memo there was an endorsement to the effect that in case of return of the ornament,
80% value of the price shall be refunded. Complainant, therefore protested against such cash memo
by contending that it is in violation of the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/297128/ 11Akhil Bhartiya Upbhokta ... vs M/S.Aggarwal Jewellers,Mr.Ajay ... on 12 December, 2005
Monopolies Restrictive Trade Practice Act, 1969. To the said letter, the jeweller replied on 2.1.1998
that the statement made by the complainant that the purity of the gold used in the ring was only of
18.4 carat was incorrect and that the purity of the gold was 23 carat. It was also stated that even
though the purity is 23 carat, 80% of the value of the ring was to be refunded because the remaining
20% is copper and other alloys as the same is used as connecting material (tanka). Hence,
complainant filed complaint case No.15/99 before the District Forum, Bhopal contending that
jeweller was adopting unfair trade practice. Similar ring was also sold to one Mr. K.L. Pandey and
Ms. Urmila Pandey.
The District Forum allowed the complaint and directed the jeweller to supply 23 carat new ring to
Mr.B.S.Sharma and Mr.K.L.Pandey in place of the old one and to pay a compensation of Rs.5000/-
to Mr. B.S. Sharma. It also directed the jeweller to abandon all kinds of unfair trade practices in
future with a direction to mention exact purity of the ornament in the cash memo sold by him.
Against that order the jeweller preferred appeal No.1630/2001 before the State Commission. By the
impugned order dated 10th July, 2003, the State Commission allowed the appeal by observing that
repurchase of the ring at 80% of its value of the gold was not indicative of purity of gold. While
making golden ornaments some addition of other metal is necessary. In addition to this, labour
charges are required to be added and the ornaments become ready for sale after proper polish.
Therefore, the order of the District Forum was neither practical nor lawful.
Petitioner has challenged the aforesaid order passed by the State Commission by filing this revision.
Shri Ajay Mishra, leanred Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of the respondent submitted that the
order passed by the State Commission is just and proper. A small ring was purchased by the
complainant.
He further submitted that the purity of gold ring was 23 carat but in addition the amount was
charged for inputs like labour charges, sales tax, cost of unrecoverable linkage used to make
ornament, labour required to be paid for refining and reclaiming gold, wastage or impurity
developed due to use and exposure of the metal. It was pointed out that the complainant has agreed
to the condition that the respondent/jeweler would repurchase the article at 80% of its value and
that it does not mean that the gold used for manufacturing the ring was of 18.4 carat i.e. 80% of 23
carat. 20% of the sale value was to be deducted at the time of repurchase from the consumers for
meeting the charges as mentioned above. It is also pointed out that even petitioner has filed an
alleged testing report dated 27.4.2000 issued by the Gwalior Bullion Laboratory wherein the purity
of gold was shown as 21 carat. No doubt, the respondent has disputed the aforesaid report by stating
that a small portion of the ring purchased by B.S. Sharma was tested and that the contents of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/297128/ 12Akhil Bhartiya Upbhokta ... vs M/S.Aggarwal Jewellers,Mr.Ajay ... on 12 December, 2005
entire ring was not tested, no affidavit of the person who gave the report was filed. No report was
obtained by the District Forum as contemplated under Section 13(1)(c) of the Consumer Protection
Act.
Considering the cash memo, it appears that the jeweller has not stated that the golden ring which
was sold, was of 80% purity. The bill only mentions that the article which was sold would be
purchased at 80% of its price. This may be because of labour charges and other expenses are
excluded while repurchasing the ring. Secondly, the test report upon which the complainant relies,
reveals that the gold was having 21 carat (87.5%) purity. In this view of the matter, the order passed
by the State Commission on facts only requires some modification.
In the result, the impugned order passed by the State Commission is partly modified. In exercise of
power under Section 14(f) of the Consumer Protection Act, it is directed that in future
respondent-jeweller shall emboss a mark indicating its quality/purity before selling the ornaments.
Secondly, we observe that simplicitor awareness on the part of the consumer will not serve any
purpose. Therefore, till the hallmarking is made compulsory, Government can issue appropriate
directions under the provisions of various Acts, to see that before sale of the gold/precious articles,
it should contain its own identification mark of quality/purity.
With these directions, the petition is disposed of. There shall be no order as to costs.
We appreciate the zeal with which the petitioner has taken up the genuine issue for the benefit of the
consumers at large. We also appreciate the assistance rendered and pains taken by Amicus
Curiae-learned Senior Counsel, Mr. M.S. Ganesh and others.
