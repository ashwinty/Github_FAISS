The Appellants/Defendants 1 to 3 have preferred the instant Second Appeal as against the Judgment
and Decree dated 08.11.1996 in A.S.No.124 of 1995 passed by the Learned Subordinate Judge,
Gobichettipalayam, in confirming the Judgment and Decree dated 25.11.1993 in O.S.No.155 of 1992
passed by the Learned District Munsif, Gobichettipalayam.
2.During the pendency of the Second Appeal, the 1st Appellant/1st Defendant expired on
29.06.2001. Upon his death, the Appellants 4 and 5 have been brought on record as Legal
Representatives of the deceased 1st Appellant.
3.Likewise, during the pendency of the Second Appeal, 1st Respondent/1st Plaintiff died on
20.09.2010 and the 4th Respondent has been arrayed as his Legal Representative.
4.The First Appellate Court viz., the Learned Subordinate Judge, Gobichettipalayam, while passing
the Judgment in A.S.No.124 of 1995 [filed by the Defendants as Appellants] on 08.11.1996, has, inter
alia, opined that 'based on Exs.A.7 to A.9, the Appellants/Defendants appears to have no manner of
legal right in the suit properties. But as per the aforesaid documents, they can enjoy the suit
property till the life-time of Pavakkal and further that the Respondents/Plaintiffs based on Ex.A.1
have right in the suit properties and they can also get the suit properties legally only after their
mother Pavakkal's death and consequently, confirmed the Judgment and Decree of the trial Court
passed in the main Suit, by holding that the Judgment and Decree of the trial Court do not suffer
from any defects and dismissed the Appeal with costs.'
5.Before the trial Court, in the main Suit, 1 to 3 issues have been framed for adjudication. On behalf
of the Respondents/Plaintiffs, witness P.W.1 has been examined and Exs.A.1 to A.12 have been
marked. On the side of the Appellants/Defendants, witness D.W.1 has been examined and no
documents have been marked.
6.The trial Court, on an examination of oral and documentary evidence available on record and
upon analysis and scrutiny of the same, has granted the relief of declaration and also the recovery of
possession to and in favour of the Respondents/Plaintiffs in respect of the suit properties and
decreed the suit without costs.
7.At the time of admission of the Second Appeal, this Court has formulated the following Substantial
Questions of Law No.1 to 4:
"1.Whether in law the courts below are right in omitting to note that Exhibit A-1 itself
is void for the reason that vested reminder cannot be created in perpetuity and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98169561/ 2Kaliappan (Died) vs A.K.Somasundaram (Died) on 8 August, 2012
therefore it offends Section 13 of the Transfer of Property Act?
2.Whether in law the courts below are right in omitting to note that when the
respondents have claimed interest in the property only after the life of Pavakkal
whether the decree for recovery of possession can be granted when the life interest
holder is still alive?
3.Whether in law the courts below are right in overlooking that the recitals in Exhibit
A-1 conferring rights to unborn male descendants of Ponnammal in perpetuity are
repugnant to Sections 113, 114 and 115 of Indian Succession Act?
4.Whether in law the Courts below did not err in overlooking that the appellants are
bona fide purchasers for value without notice who have improved the property and
who are entitled to equity under Section 33 of the Specific Relief Act?"
The Contentions, Discussions and Findings on Substantial Questions of Law No.1 to 4:
8.The Learned Counsel for the Appellants/Defendants contends that the trial Court as well as the
First Appellate Court have committed an error in holding that the Sale Deed executed by Pavakkal,
the mother of the Respondents/Plaintiffs on 10.05.1984 in favour of the Appellants is not valid.
9.It is the further submission of the Learned Counsel for the Appellants/Defendants that both the
Courts below have failed to note that Pavakkal is the absolute owner of the property as per the terms
of the Will and that the Sale Deed was attested by the elder brother of the Respondents.
10.Advancing her arguments, the Learned Counsel for the Appellants/Defendants submits that if the
Respondents/Plaintiffs were born at the time of execution of the Will, the Testator would have
executed the Will in their favour.
11.The Learned Counsel for the Appellants/Defendants projects a legal plea that both the Courts
below have failed to appreciate that the Respondents/Plaintiffs have not established that they were
born prior to the execution of Ex.A.1-Will dated 11.07.1944 and they are entitled to obtain
possession of the suit property after the death of Pavakkal.
12.Lastly, it is the contention of the Learned Counsel for the Appellants/Defendants that the
Respondents/Plaintiffs should have filed suit for setting aside the sale in favour of the Appellants/
Defendants and without setting aside the sale, the relief of declaration of possession during the
period of life interest was not a valid one.
13.Per contra, it is the submission of the Learned Counsel for the Respondents 2 and 4 that the trial
Court as well as the Appellate Court have looked into the entire gamut of the facts and
circumstances of the case and further has taken note of the oral and documentary evidence adduced
by the parties and has come to a categorical conclusion that the Respondents/Plaintiffs are entitled
to obtain the relief of declaration in respect of the suit properties and also recovery of possession
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98169561/ 3Kaliappan (Died) vs A.K.Somasundaram (Died) on 8 August, 2012
and as such, the said conclusions arrived at, need not be interfered with by this Court sitting in
Second Appeal.
14.Before dealing with the Substantial Questions of Law No.1 to 4, it is useful for this Court to make
a reference to the pleadings projected by the parties to the litigation.
15.In the Plaint, the Respondents/Plaintiffs have averred that the suit property originally belonged
to one Ponnammal, the maternal grand-mother of the Plaintiffs. She executed a registered Will on
11.07.1944 in respect of the properties including the suit property. In terms of the Will, the
properties were to be enjoyed for life by her husband and her three daughters [including the
Plaintiffs' mother Pavakkal] and subsequently to be enjoyed by her grand-sons and their heirs in
male line generation after generation without power of alienation.
(ii)The prohibition of alienation by any of the beneficiaries is not a valid one and therefore, as per
the Indian Succession Act, the property vested absolutely in the grand-sons of the said Ponnammal
on her death during the year 1945 subject to the life estates in favour of her daughters. As such, the
Respondents/Plaintiffs became the absolute owners of the vested remainder in respect of the suit
property, in possession and enjoyment of their mother Pavakkal.
(iii)The Appellants/Defendants, being aware of the aforesaid facts, had obtained Sale Deeds from
the Respondents/Plaintiffs' mother in regard to the suit property and are now in possession and
enjoyment of the same. The Sale Deeds dated 10.05.1984 could not bestow absolute title to the
Appellants/Defendants and they obtain a right to enjoy the property, as per the Sale Deeds, till the
demise of Pavakkal. The said Sale Deeds are ab initio void.
(iv)A legal notice dated 16.11.1984 was issued to the Appellants /Defendants and they had not issued
any reply, after receiving the notices. On 12.12.1991 notice was issued before filing of the suit, for
which, the Appellants/Defendants received the notice and issued a reply which contain false
allegations. Inasmuch as there was a cloud on the title of the Respondents/Plaintiffs, they had filed
the present suit for declaration of the title in respect of the suit property.
(v)In view of the fact that the Appellants/Defendants had taken over the possession of the suit
property from Respondents/Plaintiffs' mother, they ought to deliver possession of the suit property
to the Respondents/Plaintiffs on the demise of Pavakkal. Hence, the relief for delivery of possession
by the Defendants in respect of the suit property is sought for.
16.The Written Statement Pleas (filed by the 1st Appellant/1st Defendant):
(i)In the Written Statement filed by the 1st Appellant/1st Defendant (later deceased)
and adopted by Defendants 2 and 3, it was mentioned that it was true to state that the
suit property belonged to the Respondents/Plaintiffs' grand-mother Ponnammal and
further, it was equally true that the said Ponnammal wrote a Will dated 11.07.1944
and in law, after the life-time of Ponnammal's husband, the Will properties belonged
to Ponnammal's three daughters absolutely with full rights. Furthermore, as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98169561/ 4Kaliappan (Died) vs A.K.Somasundaram (Died) on 8 August, 2012
mentioned in the Will, the property could not be enjoyed from generation to
generation and that the suit properties belonged to Respondents/Plaintiffs' mother
Pavakkal absolutely and that the Appellants/Defendants' father Thavasiappa Nadar
in the suit land became a lease hold tenant and was in possession and enjoyment of
the same by means of possession. Even during the life-time of Ponnammal, the
Appellants/Defendants' father was a lease hold right holder/lessee/tenant and after
Ponnammal, the Appellants/Defendants' father was a tenant/lease holder and
enjoyed in that capacity.
(ii)After the Periyathambi Gounder, the Appellants/Defendants' father viz.,
Thavasiappa Nadar remained as a lease hold right holder/ lessee/tenant and paid the
lease hold rent and was in enjoyment of the premises. After the demise of
Periyathambi, in the suit property Pavakkal had absolute right and the
Appellants/Defendants had paid proper sale considerations and obtained a Sale Deed
from Pavakkal and was in enjoyment of the property by means of being in possession.
As such, the Respondents/Plaintiffs had no manner of right in the suit property.
(iii)The suit filed by the Respondents/Plaintiffs was not maintainable because of the
fact that the Pavakkal was not added as one of the Defendants. The Sale Deed dated
10.05.1984 executed by Pavakkal to the Appellants/Defendants could not be brushed
aside to the Respondents/Plaintiffs and when Pavakkal was alive and her life-time,
the Respondents/Plaintiffs could not seek the relief of declaration or the relief of
recovery of possession.
(iv)Moreover, in the Sale Deed executed by Pavakkal to and in favour of the
Appellants/Defendants, the Respondents/Plaintiffs' brother Ramasamy had affixed
his signature. Without impleading the Respondents/Plaintiffs' elder brother
Ramasamy, the suit was filed. The Respondents/Plaintiffs had no cause of action for
filing of the suit.
17.P.W.1 (1st Respondent/1st Plaintiff) had deposed that the suit property originally belonged to his
mother Ponnammal who executed Ex.A.1-Will dated 11.07.1944 in respect of the suit properties and
as per the Will, after the life-time of Ponnammal her husband Periyathambi Gounder was to enjoy
the suit property till his life-time and thereafter, her three daughters, Kaliammal, Pavakkal and
Marakkal had to enjoy the 'A' schedule property till their life-time and 'B' schedule property was to
be enjoyed by her brother A.K.Ramasamy till his life-time and further, three daughters had enjoyed
'A' schedule properties till their life-time and thereafter, their heirs were to enjoy the same. The
further evidence of P.W.1 was to the effect that Ponnammal, Periyathambi and Marakkal had died
and three daughters had orally partitioned 'A' schedule properties and were in enjoyment of the
same and Pavakkal, her mother had only enjoyment right in the suit property and the suit properties
were sold by her mother to the Defendants and her mother had no right to sell the same.
18.P.W.1 proceeds in her evidence to state that during the year 1984 his mother had sold the
property to the Defendants and he came to know about the sale two or three months later and that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98169561/ 5Kaliappan (Died) vs A.K.Somasundaram (Died) on 8 August, 2012
the suit property belonged to them.
19.Added further, P.W.1 (in her cross examination) had deposed that the lands mentioned in 'A'
schedule were sold by his mother's sister Marakkal and Kaliammal and that the lands at
Seiyampalayam Karai village were sold and Kaliammal has sold four acres of land at Kundrathur
Village and that Marakkal and Kaliammal had sold the lands four years prior to his mother selling
the suit properties and that he had not initiated any action in respect of those lands and that
Kaliammal had two sons and Marakkal had no children and that Kaliammal had no right to sell the
property to and in favour of her sons and that his mother and sisters had effected partition
themselves for which no document was written.
20.Apart from the above, P.W.1 had also stated that the land at Puliampatti village, the land at
Kundrathur and the land at Seiyampalayam Village the lands were equally divided between his
mother, Kaliammal and Marakkal and they were in enjoyment of the same and in respect of the
partition after their life-time all the properties were to devolve upon the male heirs, as stated in the
Will.
21.D.W.1 (in his evidence) had deposed that Appellants 2 and 3/ Defendants 2 and 3 are his brothers
and that in the suit land originally belonged to Pavakkal, his mother Ponnammal and during her
life-time of Ponnammal, they had enjoyed the suit property on lease for nearly 50 years and that by
virtue of three Sale Deeds dated 10.05.1984, they purchased the same from Pavakkal, who had right
in the suit property as per Will and the Respondents/Plaintiffs had no right in the suit property and
as per Will, Pavakkal, Marakkal and Kaliammal had other lands and the said lands were sold by the
aforesaid three persons to different persons.
22.D.W.1 (in his cross examination) had deposed that in Ex.A.1-Will dated 11.07.1944, it was
mentioned that the properties described therein were to be enjoyed after Ponnammal by her
husband till his life-time and thereafter, it was to be enjoyed by her three daughters and that 'B'
schedule property was to be enjoyed by grand-son Ramasamy and when he met the other two sisters
Marakkal and Kaliammal and when he asked them, they informed that they had no right in the suit
property and therefore, he had purchased the same during the year 1984 and the recitals in
Ex.A.7-Sale Deed dated 10.05.1984 were correct.
23.In Ex.A.1-Will dated 11.07.1944 executed by Periyathambi Gounder's wife Ponnammal viz., the
maternal grand-mother of the Respondents/Plaintiffs, in respect of her properties including the suit
properties, the recitals of the Will point out that the properties were to be enjoyed during her
life-time and after her life-time the properties are to be enjoyed by her husband Periyathambi
Gounder and he was to enjoy the income till his life-time and after his demise, the properties are to
get the 'A' schedule properties and to enjoy the same equally by her daughters 1.Kaliammal
W/o.Nanjappa Gounder; 2.Pavakkal W/o.Kulanthai Gounder; 3.Marakkal W/o.Kalyani Gounder.
Also, in the Will, it is mentioned that her son-in-law's son viz., grand child Ramasamy Gounder has
to get the 'B' schedule properties. The aforesaid four persons are to enjoy the properties till their
life-time and after their life-time, their male heirs are to enjoy the property generation after
generation.

24.Ex.A.2-Respondents/Plaintiffs' Lawyer's Notice dated 16.11.1984 addressed to the 2nd
Appellant/2nd Defendant, it is, inter alia, mentioned that Pavakkal viz., the mother of the
Respondents/ Plaintiffs has no right to sell the schedule property mentioned therein or to encumber
the same and that she has no right or claim and without the knowledge of the
Respondents/Plaintiffs, their mother Pavakkal has sold the property and the said sale will not bind
them. Ex.A.3-Respondents/Plaintiffs' Lawyer's Notice dated 16.11.1984 has been issued to the 1st
Appellant/1st Defendant (deceased).
25.In Ex.A.4, the Respondents/Plaintiffs Lawyer's Notice dated 16.11.1984 addressed to the 3rd
Appellant/3rd Defendant, it is mentioned that the Respondents/Plaintiffs' mother Pavakkal, as per
her mother Ponnammmal's Will dated 11.07.1944, is to enjoy the schedule property mentioned
therein and as per the recitals of the said Will, the said property can be enjoyed by the
Respondents/Plaintiffs' mother till her life-time and thereafter, her male heirs are to enjoy the
property. Further, it is also mentioned that the Respondents/Plaintiffs' mother has no right or to
encumber the property in any manner. But the Respondents/Plaintiffs' mother Pavakkal has sold
the property during her last year without the knowledge of the Respondents/ Plaintiffs and that the
said sale is not valid in law.
26.In Ex.A.5, the Respondents/Plaintiffs Lawyer's Notice dated 12.12.1991 addressed to the 2nd
Appellant/2nd Defendant, it is mentioned that the Respondents/Plaintiffs' mother without their
knowledge has sold the property on 10.05.1984. Already on 16.11.1984 Lawyer's notice has been
issued for which no reply in lawyer's notice has been issued or no endeavour has been made to
cancel the said Sale Deed and as such, the sale is not a legally valid one.
27.Ex.A.6 is the Reply Lawyer's Notice of the Appellants/ Defendants dated 19.12.1991 addressed to
the Respondents/Plaintiffs Lawyer, it is stated that the Appellants/Defendants' father Thavasiappa
Nadar, prior to Ponnammal executing the Sale Deed, was a lessee of the lands mentioned in the

30.The Learned Counsel for the Appellants/Defendants cites the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in Brahma Vart Sanatan Dharm Mahamandal V. Kanhaiya Lal Bagla and others, (2001) 9
Supreme Court Cases 562 at page 563 wherein it is held hereunder:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98169561/ 7Kaliappan (Died) vs A.K.Somasundaram (Died) on 8 August, 2012
"The will makes it abundantly clear that by unambiguous term the absolute
ownership of the properties was bequeathed to W by her husband. Repeatedly in the
will, it has been made clear that the intention of the executant of the will was to
bequeath absolute right of ownership of his properties to his wife.
Admittedly, the deceased widow, W, was the third wife of the testator and the testator
was not having any other heir except his wife, who was entitled to maintenance from
her husband and from his property. So, after the death of her husband, she would
have life interest in the said property even without the Will being executed in her
favour. In view of Section 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act, she would be absolute
owner of the said property. Having regard to the well-settled proposition of law in
regard to the cases like the one present herein, the exception provided under Section
14(2) of the Act would have no applicability."
31.She also relies on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ramkishorelal and another V.
Kamal Narayan, 1963 Supp (2) SCR 417 wherein, in paragraph 12, it is observed as follows:
(cid:153)2.The golden Rule of construction, it has been said, is to ascertain the intention of
the parties to the instrument after considering all the words, in their ordinary,
natural sense. To ascertain this intention the Court has to consider the relevant
portion of the document as a whole and also to take into account the circumstances
under which the particular words were used. Very often the status and the training of
the parties using the words have to be taken into consideration. It has to be borne in
mind that very many words are used in more than one sense and that sense differs in
different circumstances. Again, even where a particular word has, to a trained
conveyancer, a clear and definite significance and one can be sure about the sense in
which such conveyancer would use it, it may not be reasonable and proper to give the
same strict interpretation of the word when used by one who is not so equally skilled
in the art of conveyancing. Sometimes' it happens in the case of documents as regards
disposition of properties, whether they are testamentary or non testamentary
instruments, that there is a clear conflict between what is said in one part of the
document and in another. A familiar in-stance of this is where in an earlier part of the
document some property is given absolutely to one person but later on, other
directions about the same property are given which conflict with and take away from
the absolute title given in the earlier portion. What is to be done where this happens ?
If is well settled that in case of such a conflict the earlier disposition of absolute title
should prevail and the later directions of disposition should be disregarded as
unsuccessful attempts to restrict the title already given. (See Sahebzada Mohd.
Kamgar Shah v. Jagdish Chandra Deo Dhabal Deo). (1960) (3) SCR 604 at p. 611. It is
clear, however, that an attempt should always be made to read the two parts of the
document harmoniously, if possible. It is only when this is not possible, e. g., where
an absolute title is given is in clear and unambiguous terms and the later provisions
trench on the same, that the later provisions have to be held to be void.(cid:20)

32.The Learned Counsel for the Appellants/Defendants invites the attention of this Court to the
decision in G.Narayanan and others V. R.N.Rajagopalan and others, AIR 1987 Madras 75 at page 80
wherein, at paragraph 8, it is laid down as follows:
(cid:19)8. In so far as the bequest regarding the first schedule properties in favour of the
first appellant is concerned, the testator has provided that the first appellant and his
heirs should from generation to generation enjoy the properties without in any
manner encumbering them and perform the charity, of feeding the Brahmins on
'Thuvadasi' days with the income therefrom. The interest thus conferred on the first
appellant with reference to the first schedule properties is only a life interest. Cl. 3 of
the Will creates not only a life interest in favour of the first appellant but also a series
of successive life interests in favour of the heirs of the first appellant. No such valid
successive life interest can be created in favour of persons in existence and unborn
persons. But when there is a gift to a class of persons some of whom are in existence
and others are not, such a gift will be valid and take effect with regard to persons in
existence at the time of the testator's death and invalid regarding others, but it does
not fail wholly and totally.
The first appellant was undoubtedly alive when the testator died in 1928 and, therefore, the life
interest in respect of the first schedule properties conferred in his favour under the Will Exhibit A-1
would undoubtedly take effect. But as regards respondents 1 and 2 they were not in existence on the
date when the will under Exhibit A-1 took effect, for it is seen from the plaint that they were born in
1945 and 1947 respectively, while the will had come into effect in 1928, on the death of the testator.
The creation of successive life estates and (that) too in favour of persons not in existence is not
permissible in law and the life estate so created in favour of persons in existence and those not in
existence would take effect with reference to those in existence at the time of the death of the
testator and invalid as to the rest. This is clearly laid down by the Supreme Court in Bajrang
Bahadur Singh v. Bakhtraj Kuer, (1953) 1 Mad LJ (SC) 108: AIR 1953 SC 7.
In view of this, it follows that the life estate conferred in favour of the first appellant under the Will
Exhibit A-1 with reference to the first schedule properties thereunder alone is valid and not the
subsequent life estates in favour of his heirs, who were not in existence on the date when the testator
died. It also follows that the successive life estates in favour of the heirs of the first appellant or the
restrictions regarding the alienations imposed under Cl. 3 of the Will would not be binding upon
respondents 1 and 2. The first appellant under Exhibit A- 1 secured only a life interest in the first
schedule properties (the suit properties) and the remainder vested in respondents 1 and 2 free from
the restrictions imposed on the nature of the estate and the power of dealing with the property. That
would mean that any dealing by the first appellant regarding the suit properties would not enure
beyond his lifetime. Respondents 1 and 2 are, therefore, entitled to succeed to the properties after
the lifetime of the first appellant and the transactions of partition and other alienations entered into
by, the first appellant would not, therefore, be binding upon respondents 1 and 2."
33.That apart, the Learned Counsel for the Appellants/ Defendants cites the following decisions:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98169561/ 9Kaliappan (Died) vs A.K.Somasundaram (Died) on 8 August, 2012
(a)In Beni Bai V. Raghubir Prasad, (1999) 3 Supreme Court Cases 234 at page 235,
the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in paragraph 8, has held as follows:
(cid:19)8.In the present case, the widow was conferred the limited right in lieu of
maintenance in recognition of her pre-existing right. The limited interest conferred
upon her by virtue of the Will being in lieu of maintenance and in recognition of her
pre-existing right, the said right transformed into an absolute right by virtue of
Section 14 (1) of the Act. The said right was not conferred on her for the first time.
Thus sub-section (2) of Section 14 of the Act has no application to the present case.
Under such circumstances, the widow became the absolute owner of House No. 27
and was fully competent to execute the Gift Deed in favour of her daughter. The Gift
Deed executed by the widow was thus valid. (cid:19)
(b)In Palchuri Hanumayamma V. Tadikamalla Kotlingam (Dead) by LRs. and others,
(2001) 8 Supreme Court Cases 552 at page 559 & 560 in paragraph 12 and 13, it is
mentioned as follows:
(cid:153)2.Mr. Nagaraja has also relied on Section 19 of the Transfer of Property Act and
Section 119 of the Indian Succession Act. According to him, under Section 19 of the
T.P. Act, the interest in the suit property created in favour of the appellants mother is
a vested interest and merely because the time of handing over of possession is
postponed till the death of the widow or the right to manage and enjoy the fruits of
the property are conferred on the widow till her death, the right which is a vested
interest in the property in favour of the mother of the appellant, does not cease to be
a vested interest. This would have been so if, as a matter of fact, under the Will, a
right had vested in the appellants mother. While discussing the other contentions
advanced on behalf of the appellant, we have come to the conclusion that under the
Will no right had vested in any of the daughters and the property in question was
given to Ramamma in lieu of her maintenance during her life-time and it is only after
the death of Ramamma that the surviving right, if any, would have vested in the
daughters. But befroe the death of Ramamma in view of the intervening factor,
namely, enactment of Section 14 of the 1956 Act, deprived the daughters of their legal
right to claim a share in the property because by virtue of the said enactment,
Ramammas right got enlarged into an absolute estate and she became an absolute
owner of the property, therefore, reliance on Section 19 of the T.P. Act is misplaced.
13.Similarly, Section 119 of the Succession Act provides where in a bequest a legatee
is not entitled to immediate possession of the thing bequeathed, a right to receive it at
the proper time shall unless a contrary intention appears by Will, become vested in
the legatee on the testators death. By this, Mr. Nagaraja wanted us to come to the
conclusion that on the death of the testator the right in the property bequeathed
vested in the three daughters. We are unable to accept this argument for the very
same reason based on which we have turned down his contention based on Section 19
of the T.P. Act.(cid:20)

(c)In Vaddeboyina Tulasamma and others V. Vaddeboyina Sesha Reddi (Dead) by
Lrs., AIR 1977 Supreme Court 1944, it is observed as follows:
(cid:19)Sub-section (1) of Section 14 is large in its amplitude and covers every kind of
acquisition of property by a female Hindu including acquisition in lieu of
maintenance and where such property was possessed by her at the date of
commencement of the Act or was subsequently acquired and possessed. She would
become the full owner of the property. Sub-section (2) is more in the nature of a
proviso or exception to sub-section (1). It excepts certain kinds of acquisition of
property by a Hindu female from the operation of sub-section (1) and being in the
nature of an exception to a provision which is calculated to achieve a social purpose
by bringing about change in the social and economic position of woman in Hindu
society, it must be construed strictly so as to impinge as little as possible on the broad
sweep of the ameliorative provision contained in sub-section (1). It cannot be
interpreted in a manner which would rob sub-section (1) of its efficacy and deprive a
Hindu female of the protection sought to be given to her by sub-section (1).
Sub section (2) must, therefore, be read in the context of sub-section (1) so as to leave
as large a scope for operation as possible to sub-section (1) and so read, it must be
confined to cases where property is acquired by a female Hindu for the first time as a
grant without any pre-existing right, under a gift, will, instrument, decree, order or
award, the terms of which prescribe a restricted estate in the property. Where,
however, property is acquired by a Hindu female at a partition or in lieu of right of
maintenance, it is in virtue of a pre-existing right and such an acquisition would not
be within the scope and ambit of sub-section (2), even if the instrument, decree,
order or award allotting the property prescribes a restricted estate in the property.(cid:20)
34.The Learned Counsel for the Appellants submits that Pavakkal viz., the mother of the
Respondents/Plaintiffs sold the properties, as per Exs.A.7 to A.9-Sale Deeds, to the Appellants/
Defendants and ever since the date of purchase, they are in possession and enjoyment of the same.
Further, the Respondents/ Plaintiffs have filed the suit 8 years after the sales that were effected
during the year 1984 and that even on the date of filing of the suit, the Respondents/Plaintiffs'
mother Pavakkal was alive and she was not added as a party to the suit and also that one more sister
and other sisters were not parties to the suit.
35.It is the contention of the Learned Counsel for the Appellants/Defendants that as per Ex.A.1-Will
dated 11.07.1944 no life estate in first clause in respect of 'A' schedule properties was given and that
there cannot be any life estate by generation after generation.
36.The Learned Counsel for the Appellants/Defendants contends that Ponnammal died in the year
1945 and Periyathambi (her husband) died after 3 years in the year 1948 and as per Hindu
Succession Act, 1956 Ponnammal's right enlarges into absolute estate as per Section 14(1) of the
Hindu Succession Act, viz., the right of maintenance.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98169561/ 11Kaliappan (Died) vs A.K.Somasundaram (Died) on 8 August, 2012
37.Also, the Learned Counsel for the Appellants/Defendants projects a plea that in the Will,
Ponnammal's daughter Pavakkal as a pre-existing right and hence, Section 14(1) of the Hindu
Succession Act will apply.
38.The plea of the Appellants/Defendants is that for non-joinder of Pavakkal and brother
Ramasamy in the suit, the suit filed by the Respondents/Plaintiffs is to be dismissed.
39.It is also the contention of the Appellants/Defendants that the sale by Pavakkal, as per Will and
Partition, will bind the Respondents/ Plaintiffs.
40.The Learned Counsel for the Appellants/Defendants referred to Section 10 of the Transfer of
Property Act, 1882 which speaks of 'Right of transfer' which is incidental to, and inseparable from,
the beneficial ownership of property. As a matter of fact, Section 10 of the Transfer of Property Act
incorporates a Rule of Justice, Equity and Good Conscience and governs transfers to which the
Transfer of Property Act does not apply. Section 10 enjoins that 'a condition which absolutely
restraints the power of alienation is void.'
41.Also, the Learned Counsel for the Appellants/Defendants drawn the attention of this Court
Section 13 of the Transfer of Property Act which speaks of 'Transfer for benefit of Unborn person'.
Further, the Learned Counsel for the Appellants/Defendants has also invited the attention of this
Court to Section 14 of the Transfer of Property Act which speaks of 'Rule against perpetuity'
42.It is to be noted that Section 13 of the Transfer of Property Act dealing with 'Transfer for Benefit
of Unborn Person' is almost similar to that of Section 113 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925. It
cannot be lost sight of that Section 13 of the Transfer of Property Act controls Section 113 of the
Indian Succession Act and both of them are to be read together, as opined by this Court.
43.As regards the Rule against perpetuity under Section 14 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, it
is based on the policy that the liberty of alienation is not to be exercised to its own destruction and
that all contrivances shall be void which tend to create a perpetuity or place property forever beyond
the reach of the exercise of power of alienation.
44.It must be borne in mind that the rule against perpetuity does not require that the vesting shall
take place at the birth of the ultimate beneficiary. It requires that the vesting cannot be delayed in
any case beyond his minority.
45.Section 10 of the Transfer of Property Act points out to a restriction on the transfer of property.
However, Section 11 of the Act refers to a restriction on the enjoyment of property. It is to be kept in
mind that the two Sections is on the same principle that a condition repugnant to the interest
created is void. It cannot be gainsaid that Section 11 of the Act speaks of absolute interest only. A
restraint on transfer is repugnant to any interest in property, whether absolute or limited, for the
right of transfer is an incident of ownership. A restriction on enjoyment is repugnant to an absolute
interest, but it may not be repugnant to a limited interest such as a lease-hold or a life-estate. Also,
the difference between Section 13 of Transfer of Property Act and Section 113 of the Indian
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98169561/ 12Kaliappan (Died) vs A.K.Somasundaram (Died) on 8 August, 2012
Succession Act is that the earlier Section pertains to transfer inter vivos, while the latter relates to
bequest which comes into effect only on the death of the testator. The essential feature mentioned in
Section 113 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 is that an individual disposing of property to another
shall not fetter the free disposition of that property in the hands of numerous generations. The rule
is far away from the rule against perpetuity, although their effects sometimes overlap each other.
46.At this stage, this Court aptly points out the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Raj
Bajrang Bahadur Singh V. Thakurain Bakhtraj Kuer, AIR 1953 Supreme Court 7 wherein in
paragraph 13 and 14, it is held as follows:
(cid:153)3. .... In cases where the intention of the testator is to grant an absolute estate, an
attempt to reduce the powers of the owner by imposing restraint on alienation would
certainly be repelled on the ground 'of repugnancy; but where the restrictions are the
primary things which the testator desires and they are consistent with the whole
tenor of the Will, it is a material circumstance to be relied upon for displacing the
presumption of absolute ownership implied in the use of the word "malik".
14..... It is quite true that no interest could be created in favour of an unborn person
but when the gift is made to a class or series of persons, some of whom are in
existence and some are not, it does not fail in its entirety; it is valid with regard to the
persons who are in existence at the time of the testator's death and is invalid as to the
rest.(cid:20)
47.In P.V.S.Vencatachellum V. P.V.S.Kabalamurthy Pillai, AIR 1955 Madras 350 at page 351, it is
held thus:
(cid:19)Under Section 10 of the Transfer of Property Act, a condition absolutely restraining
a transferee from disposing of the property is void, and the section is wholly silent as
to the validity of qualified restraints on alienation. A condition imposing a partial
restraint on alienation is not void. Whether the restraint in a particular case is
absolute or partial has to be gathered from the intention of the transferor from the
contents of the document. Section 10 relates only to transfers made by act of parties.
It does not apply to sales under the Indian Companies Act, nor to transfers by
operation of law taking effect 'in invitum' at a sale in execution of a decree. A family
arrangement and a compromise of disputed claims are not transfers. But the
principle would be applicable where the condition involves an absolute restraint on
alienation. Similarly, the section does not apply to partitions; but restraints clearly
offending the rule must be held to be void.
48.Also, this Court worth recalls the decision of this Court in T.Subramania Nadar V.
T.Varadharajan and another, (2003) 2 M.L.J. 224 at page 225, wherein in paragraphs 15 and 17, it is
laid down as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98169561/ 13Kaliappan (Died) vs A.K.Somasundaram (Died) on 8 August, 2012
(cid:153)5. What is given to unborn person need not necessarily vest in him at his birth.
Vesting must, however, takes place other than the limitations prescribed by Section
14. Section 14 of the Transfer of Property Act controls Section 13 of the Transfer of
Property Act and as such both these sections should be read together.
17.The effect of these enactments is that a gift can be made to an unborn person
subject to the following conditions (i) that the gift shall be of the whole of the
remaining interest of the testator in the thing bequeathed and not of a limited
interest; and (ii) that the vesting is not postponed beyond the life in being and 18
years, being the rule against perpetuities as laid down in Section 114.
49.This Court in the interest of justice, cites the following decisions:
(a)In the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in F.M.Devaru Ganapati Bhat V.
Prabhakar Ganapathi Bhat, (2004) MLJ 180 (S.C.) at page 184 wherein in paragraph
12, it is held hereunder:
(cid:153)2.There is no ban on the transfer of interest in favour of an unborn person. Section
20 permits an interest being created for the benefit of an unborn person who acquires
interest upon his birth. No provision has been brought to our notice which stipulates
that full interest in a property cannot be created in favour of unborn person. Section
13 has no applicability to the facts and circumstances of the present case. In the
present case, the donor gifted the property in favour of the appellant, then living, and
also stipulated that if other male children are later born to her brother they shall be
joint holders with the appellant. Such a stipulation is not hit by Section 13 of the Act.
Creation of such a right is permissible under Section 20 of the Act. The respondent,
thus, became entitled to the property on his birth. In this view, there is also no
substance in the second contention.(cid:20)
(b)In Ramu Gounder and others V. K.Radhakrishnan, (2003) 3 MLJ 223, it is
observed as follows:
(cid:19)It is well settled that in case of such a conflict the earlier disposition of absolute title
should prevail and the later directions of disposition should be disregarded as
unsuccessful attempts to restrict the title.
Thus the subsequent repugnant recital found in Ex.A. 2 could have been made to
enable the testator to enjoy the property till her life-time and that is why a
prohibiting clause was subsequently inserted upon that the executee should not
encumber the property. By proper construction of the same such a meaning alone can
be given. Otherwise, this clause should be considered as repugnant to earlier one and
had to be eschewed.(cid:20)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98169561/ 14Kaliappan (Died) vs A.K.Somasundaram (Died) on 8 August, 2012
(c)In C.Manoharan V. C.V.Subramaniam and others, (2006) 4 MLJ 898, it is held as
follows:
(cid:19)When an appeal is disposed of without notice of death of one of the parties, the legal
representatives of the deceased party are bound by the decree passed and they cannot
contend that the decree is a nullity.(cid:20) (cid:19)Plaintiffs who were not born at the time of the
execution of the settlement deed in their favour, are bound by the acts of the life
estate holder, which resulted in a Court auction sale of the property covered under
the settlement deed.(cid:20)
50.In law, a perpetuity is the settlement of an estate or an interest in tail, with such remainders
expectant upon it as are in no sort in the power of the tenant in tail in possession to dock by any
recovery or an assignment as per Lord Nottingham in Duke of Narfolk's Case, (1881) 3 Ch.Ca.1. The
original sense of 'Perpetuity' is an inalienable, and indestructible interest according to
Mukhopadhyaya's Law of perpetuities, at page 25. The modern sense of 'perpetuity' is an interest
which will not vest till a remote period. Therefore, a perpetuity is a limitation, with a view to take the
subject out of commerce, for a longer period than a life or lives in being and 21 years beyond, and in
the case of posthumous child, a few months more, allowing for the term of gestation as per Lewis on
Perpetuity, Ch.12. As far as our country is concerned, instead of 21 years, the minority of some
individuals who are not in existence. In few cases, it may go up to 21 years. In modern times, the
term 'perpetuity' as the meaning of 'inalienable interest' against the old fashioned sense of an
'unbarrable entail' [vide Preface to Jarman on Wills, 6th Edn. at page iv].
51.The ingredients of Section 113 of the Indian Succession Act deals with the subject of gifts to
unborn persons and also it prescribes the limit of the quantum of interest that can be provided to an
unborn person i.e. one cannot give a life interest or any other limited interest to an unborn person.
Further, if a bequest is to be made in favour of an unborn person, then, the testator should give the
whole of the beneficial interest to that unborn child in order that it should be valid and that if the
entire remaining interest is not given such a bequest is wholly void.
52.Moreover, the testator can provide a fractional interest in any property an unborn individual. The
term 'the whole of the remaining interest of the testator' does not refer to the whole property of the
testator. The expression 'remaining interest' in law, means the entire interest of the testator less the
interest carried out by the earlier bequest. The term 'remaining interest' means an interest which is
as completed as an interest which the testator had in the property bequeathed, such interest not
being fettered or limited except by and to the extent of the prior estates. However, whether a vested
interest is provided in the property bequeathed in favour of an unborn person the vested interest
would not be avoided merely by reason of imposition of limitations which restrict enjoyment.
53.In the instant case on hand, the property mentioned in the schedule of the Plaint in O.S.No.153 of
1992 filed by the Respondents/Plaintiffs is in respect of new S.F.No.222 (Old S.F.Nos.2-B/2, 4-B
and 5-A) Nanja land extent 2.73 acres (1.26.5 hectares) with Koppu, Pali, Pasanavar and other
easement rights attached to the land, situated at Nanjai Puliampatti Village, Gobichettipalayam
Taluk within the sub-registration district of Thookanaickenpalayam and the registration district of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98169561/ 15Kaliappan (Died) vs A.K.Somasundaram (Died) on 8 August, 2012
Gobichettipalayam.
54.In Ex.A.7-Sale Deed dated 10.05.1984 Pavakkal has sold an extent of 0.37 out of hectares 1.26.5
in New Government Survey No.222 of Nanjai Puliampatti Village. In Ex.A.8-Sale Deed dated
10.05.1984 executed by Pavakkal to and in favour of the 2nd Appellant /2nd Defendant an extent of
0.37.0 has been sold out of hectare 1.26.5 in New Government Survey No.222 at Nanjai Puliampatti
Village of Gobichettipalayam Taluk. In Ex.A.9-Sale Deed dated 10.05.1984 Pavakkal has sold to the
3rd Appellant/3rd Defendant an extent of 0.37.0 out of hectare 1.26.5 in New Government Survey
No.222 of Nanjai Puliampatti.
55.The trial Court, in its Judgment in the main suit, at paragraph 11, has, among other things,
opined that though the Appellants/ Defendants have purchased the suit property by means of Sale
Deed dated 10.05.1984 and have been in enjoyment of the same, yet, it is not a valid sale as per
recitals of Ex.A.1-Will. Further, it also held that since on both sides it has been admitted that the
Appellants/ Defendants are in enjoyment of the suit properties, till the death of Pavakkal, as per
Sale Deed, they are entitled to be in possession of the same. Also that the trial Court has come to the
conclusion that the Respondents/Plaintiffs are entitled to claim recovery of possession in respect of
the suit properties from the Appellants/Defendants after the death of Pavakkal.
56.The trial Court, in the Judgment, has referred to the decision of this Court in Maya Jothi V.
Ranganayaki Ammal, 93 L.W. at page 566 wherein it is held as follows:
"In this case the settlement confers only a life interest in favour of the defendant and
not an absolute interest, and that after her lifetime the property will have to be taken
by her heirs who are alive on the date of her death."
57.Also, the trial Court has referred to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in S.Rajagopal
Chettiar V. Hamasaveni Ammal and others, AIR 1992 Supreme Court 704 wherein it is held as
follows:
"3.After going through the contents of the will we agree with the view taken by the
High Court. We do not agree with the contention of the learned counsel for the
appellant raised before us that Padmanabha Chettiar, the testator, of the will wanted
to give absolute right in the property to his wife Dhanalakshmi Ammal and thereafter
absolute right in favour of his daughter Rajalakshmi Ammal. The above intention is
negatived by a clear mention in the will that after Rajalakshmi Ammal the property
shall ultimately go to her male children. In case the intention of the testator was to
give the properties absolutely in favour of Rajalakshmi and not merely life interest
then there was no question of mentioning that after her it should go to her male
children."
58.The First Appellate Court, in A.S.No.124 of 1995 filed by the Appellants/Defendants, on
08.11.1996 has held that there are no defects in the Judgment and Decree of the trial Court and
accordingly, confirmed the same thereby dismissing the Appeal with costs.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98169561/ 16Kaliappan (Died) vs A.K.Somasundaram (Died) on 8 August, 2012
59.A cursory perusal of the recitals of Ex.A.1-Will dated 11.07.1944 executed by Ponnammal
(Testatrix) shows that it has following three Clauses:
(i) The properties mentioned in the Will were to be enjoyed by her husband
Periyathambi Gounder;
(ii) After his demise, their 3 daughters viz., 1.Kaliammal; 2.Pavakkal; 3.Marakkal are
to enjoy the 'A' schedule properties equally;
(iii) Thereafter, her son-in-law Kulandaisamy Gounder's son viz., the grand-son
Ramasamy Gounder is to get the 'B' schedule properties. Moreover, after their
demise, their male heirs are to enjoy the said properties generation after generation
without the power of encumbrance. In respect of 'B' schedule properties, her
grand-son Ramasamy Gounder and his male successive heirs have no right to
mortgage/create Bokiyam and even if they have created like that, they are not valid.
60.It is not in doubt that as per Ex.A.1-Will dated 11.07.1944, the Respondents/Plaintiffs' mother
Pavakkal has right to enjoy the suit properties till her life-time. Therefore, when she has executed
Exs.A.7 to A.9-Sale Deeds dated 10.05.1984 in respect of the properties mentioned therein to and in
favour of the Appellants/Defendants, then, the said Sale Deeds are a valid one because of the fact
that a life interest/life estate holder is entitled to sell her interest to and in favour of third
parties/strangers, in the considered opinion of this Court.
61.The Appellants/Defendants, in law, are entitled to be in possession, till the life interest holder
viz., Pavakkal is alive, as opined by this Court. During the life-time of Pavakkal, the Respondents/
Plaintiffs cannot seek the relief of declaration of their title in the suit properties. As such, the contra
view taken by the trial Court as well as the First Appellate Court, that the Respondents/Plaintiffs are
entitled to obtain the relief of declaration in respect of suit properties, are not in accordance with the
well laid down principles of law.
62.However, this Court holds that the Appellants/Defendants are entitled to hold and enjoy the suit
properties as per the Sale Deeds till the life-time of Pavakkal. Further, it is held by this Court that till
the life-time of Pavakkal, the Respondents/Plaintiffs cannot claim the recovery of possession in
respect of suit properties from the Appellants/Defendants because of the fact that Pavakkal during
her life-time, having conveyed the suit properties, the Respondents/ Plaintiffs cannot seek recovery
of possession because they as vested remainders have to wait till the exclusion of life interest holder
viz., Pavakkal or her demise.
63.The recital of Ex.A.1-Will dated 11.07.1944 of Ponnammal, the maternal grand-mother of
Respondents/Plaintiffs clearly spell out her intention to give the properties for her grand-sons and
as such, it does not create any right endlessly, in the considered opinion of this Court. Moreover, the
clause in Ex.A.1-Will, '... Thereafter, to be enjoyed by her grand-sons is a valid one for one
generation and therefore, it does not offend Section 13 of the Transfer of Property Act which deals
with the transfer for the benefit of an unborn person.' Also, that Ex.A.1-Will dated 11.07.1944 is not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98169561/ 17Kaliappan (Died) vs A.K.Somasundaram (Died) on 8 August, 2012
a void one and also it does not offend Section 113 of the Indian Succession Act. Continuing further,
conferring rights to unborn person is valid up to the first generation because of the fact that the
intention of Ponnammal (Testatrix) is to provide for the unborn male children.
64.The Appellants/Defendants, after their purchase of the suit properties as per Exs.A.7 to A.9-Sale
Deeds from Pavakkal, have stepped into her shoes. As a matter of fact, the contents and recitals of
Ex.A.1-Will dated 11.07.1944 executed by Ponnammal are explicit and they are self-explanatory, as
opined by this Court. In the Written Statement filed by the Appellants/Defendants, no plea has been
taken that the Appellants/Defendants are the bona fide purchasers of the concerned properties for
value without notice and made improvements etc. In law, the purchasers of properties, even if they
are aware of defective title of vendor at the time of agreement of sale/purchase, are entitled to refuse
to purchase the properties and they cannot be compelled to purchase the same.
65.Section 51 of The Transfer of Property Act, 1882 refers to 'Improvements made by bona fide
holders under defective titles'. The ambit of Section 51 of The Transfer of Property Act, 1882 is
limited, since it applies to a transferee who in good faith believes himself that he is absolutely
entitled to. Section 51 of The Transfer of Property Act, 1882 is a general one whereas Section 63A of
The Transfer of Property Act is a special Section which refers to 'Improvements to mortgage
property'.
66.D.W.1, in his cross examination (before the trial Court), has deposed that they have purchased
the lands from the Respondents/ Plaintiffs mother Pavakkal. The Appellants/Defendants have not
taken the plea before the trial Court, in their Written Statement, that they have purchased the
properties as bona fide purchasers for value without notice and made improvements thereon.
Equally, no issue has been framed by the trial Court in this regard. Therefore, this Court is not going
into the entitlement or otherwise of Equity relief pleaded by the Appellants/Defendants as per
Section 33 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. However, this Court, in the interest of justice, directs the
Appellants/Defendants to agitate their rights if any as per Section 51 of The Transfer of Property
Act, 1882 (relating to improvements etc.) by means of separate legal proceedings before the
competent forum in the manner known to law if they so desired and advised.
67.it is to be noted that in regard to the relief of recovery of possession, the period of limitation is 12
years.
68.In law, in an instrument of Will any number of life interests can be created, but a vested
remainder cannot be passed on beyond one generation. Inasmuch as the intention of Ponnammal
(Testatrix) in Ex.A.1-Will dated 11.07.1944 is to provide for unborn male children, then, conferring
of such right to them are valid up to the first generation and in law, there is no fetter/bar on the
transfer of interests in favour of an unborn person. Therefore, Ex.A.1-Will specifying a clause that
after Pavakkal's life-time, properties are to be enjoyed by her grand-sons are not in any way
repugnant to the ingredients of Sections 113, 114 and 115 of the Indian Succession Act. In any event,
the clause in Ex.A.1-Will '...... grand-sons heir in male line generation after generation are to enjoy
the properties without power of alienation', offends rule against perpetuity. Accordingly, the
Substantial Questions of Law 1 to 4 are so answered.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/98169561/ 18Kaliappan (Died) vs A.K.Somasundaram (Died) on 8 August, 2012
69.In the result, this Court holds that the Appellants/Defendants are entitled to hold and enjoy the
properties as per the Sale Deeds till the life-time of Pavakkal. Further, it is held by this Court that till
the life-time of Respondents/Plaintiffs' mother Pavakkal, they cannot claim the recovery of
possession in respect of the suit properties from the Appellants/Defendants because of the fact that
Pavakkal during her life-time having conveyed the suit properties, the Respondents/ Plaintiffs
cannot seek recovery of possession in view of the fact that as vested remainders they are to wait till
the exclusion of life interest holder viz., Pavakkal or her demise. The Appellants/Defendants are
directed to agitate their rights, if any, as per Section 51 of The Transfer of Property Act, 1882
(relating to improvements etc.) by means of separate legal proceedings before the competent forum
in the manner known to law, if they so desired and advised. The Second Appeal is disposed of, in
above terms. The parties are directed to bear their own costs. To that extent, the Judgment and
Decree of the trial Court in O.S.No.155 of 1992 dated 25.11.1993 and that of the First Appellate Court
in A.S.No.124 of 1995 dated 08.11.1996 stand modified.
