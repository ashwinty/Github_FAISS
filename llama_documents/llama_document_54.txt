(3). THE CONTROVERSY- Revenue contends it to be an instrument of conveyance of
properties comprised in Bhilwara unit owned by Rajasthan Spinning & Weaving Mill
Ltd. (RSWM) which includes plant, machinery, buildings and fixtures alongwith lease
hold rights in land on which factory is situated to respondent Bhilwara Spinners Ltd.
hence Stamp Duty is payable as a conveyance and valorem on entire value of the property
comprising all the aforesaid assets and not as a document of lease as it reads.
(4). The controversy had arisen in the facts and circumstances to the narrated briefly hereinafter
and detailed in the order under appeal. The instrument in question described as supplementary
lease in respect of'56 acres of land executed between Stale of Rajasthan as lessor and BSL and lessee
for 72 years for consideration of rent of Rs. 1680 per annum. The 'said 56 acres of land was
originally held by Rajasthan Spinning and Weaving Mills Limited (for short, 'RSWM' hereinafter) as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1102562/ 2State Of Rajasthan vs Bhilwara Spinners Ltd. And Ors. on 27 November, 2000
agriculture land which was given to the RSWM on 15.7.51 for the purpose of setting up of an
industrial unit for establishing industry thereon for manufacturing cotton and synthetic yarn. The
Khatedari rights in the agriculture land were surrendered and the land was converted into industrial
land on or about November 26, 1968. The State Govt. executed as lease deed conveying the lease
hold rights of the said properly to the RSWM. The said lease was for a period of 99 years with an
option of renewal for a further period of 99 years at the instance of the lessee. The said RSWM set
up its factory at Bhilwara on the aforesaid plot of land. For its own reasons, the RSWM decided to
transfer its unit at Bhilwara to its 100% owned subsidiary company to be incorporated, the RSWM,
in the Extra-ordinary General Meeting of its Members, held on 24th January, 1983 gave its consent
to the Board in terms of Sec. 293 and other applicable provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 to take
effective steps for selling, transferring or leasing out the Bhilwara unit of the company to a separate
existing company whose name shall be changed to Bhilwara Spinners Private Limited or such other
name as may be allowed by the Registrar of Companies and the Central Govt. on the book value on
the condition that the vendor (RSWM) shall receive in part consideration 9,90,000 equity shares of
Rs. 10 in BSL and the balance consideration payable by BSL in 8 half yearly instalments. The
resolution further stipulated that the BSL at the time of transfer shall be a 100% subsidiary of the
Rajasthan Spinning Weaving Mills Ltd. The case of the petitioners in this connection has been that
the transfer of the plant, building and machinery of the RSWM to its subsidiary company, that is the
petitioner BSL, was by way of sale of shares of the petitioner company in accordance with the
provisions of Companies Act, 1956 i.e. the part of the transaction and BSL in connection with the
transfer of property from holding company to the subsidiary company which as per resolution
referred to above and produced as a part of Annx. P/24-A was to be 100% subsidiary as on the date
of the transfer. The fact about the resolution and the transaction between the two companies is not
disputed. In this connection the case of the State is that the same was not in accordance with the
provisions of law because as per provisions of Sec. 17 of the Indian Registration Act as well as Sec.
56 of the Transfer of Properties Act if immovable property having value of Rs. 100 and more is
transferred then the same can be done only through a registered transfer deed. Be that as it may, the
RSWM proposed to assign its interest in the land held under 99 years lease from the State of
Rajasthan (Annx.P/2) to the BSL. The lease Annx. P/2 contained the condition No. 7 that the lessee
shall not sublet, underlet or sell its lease hold rights under the lease deed without the written
consent of the lessor, provided however that the lessee shall have the right to assign or the mortgage
its lease hold rights thereby demised in favour of a financial institution or institutions for the
purpose of availing of financial assistance etc. As the lease-hold rights have been created in respect
of industrial land, the aforesaid condition was in consonance with Rule 9 of the Industrial Area
Allotment Rule, 1959 framed under the Rajasthan Land Revenue Act. As the transfer of its Bhilwara
unit of the RSWM to its subsidiary company BSL involved also the transfer of lease-hold rights in
land held by RSWM, on which the unit was established, the RSWM applied for the consent of the
State Govt., the allotting authority. By communication dated 14th July, 1983", the State Govt.
conveyed its consent for transfer of the lease- hold rights of the RSWM to BSL for the remainder
period envisaging that the supplementary lease shall be executed for the remainder period by the
BSL in favour of State. In this connection, clause 3 of sanction letter reads as under:-

djuh gksxhA** (5). After grant of this sanction, Collector Bhilwara for and on behalf
of the Governor, State of Rajasthan, executed the instrument in question described as
supplementary lease deed on 25th day of March, 1988 accepting the BSL as the lessee
of the plot in question for 72 years of the period of lease which was the remaining
period of lease granted in favour of the RSWM, for which the lessee was to pay
stipulated rent of Rs. 1680/- per year. This instrument was also signed on behalf of
the lessee BSL. However, the RSWM, the original lessee, is not a patty to this
instrument in any manner. Annexure P/14, the supplementary lease deed only
enumerates that facts that have happened prior to execution of supplementary lease
deed namely that the lessor is granted the permission to transfer the lease-hold rights
in the land measuring 104 bighas 8 biswas (58 acres approximately) in favour of the
lessee and the lessee (BSL) agreed to accept the lease of the plot of land as described
in the lease deed dated 22nd Nov., 1968 which was executed by erstwhile M/s.
Rajasthan Spinning and Weaving Milts. Ltd. and which was registered at Sub-
Registrar's at Bhilwara on 25.11.68 and whereas in compliance of Notification No.
P4/59/U/1/83 dated 14th July, 1983 (the letter of sanction Ex. P/3 granting
permission to the RSWM to transfer its lease-hold rights), the lessee agreed to
execute the supplementary lease deed for the land in question. The stamp duty as
payable under Article 25-A of the Schedule appended to the Indian Stamps Act, 1989
as amended for the State of Rajasthan was paid. This instrument was registered by
the Sub Registrar, Bhilwara on 28th March, 1988. Soon after the aforesaid
instrument was registered on 28.3.83 as supplementary document, on 29.3.88, the
Sub Registrar made a reference to the Collector of Stamps that since it was not
correction of a clerical error, it was not supplementary instrument under Article 25-A
of the Rajasthan Stamp Law Adoption Act, 1952 but is a fresh lease deed and ought to
have been stamped as a fresh lease deed. It also stated that it amounted to material
alteration in the existing lease, therefore, fresh stamp duly was payable. The
estimated stamp duty was stated to be Rs. 79 lakhs on the basis of market value of the
property. II also stated that since it is a fresh lease deed it ought of have been
executed in terms of the Rajasthan Industrial allotment Rules 1959 by charging
premium and development charges and that ought to have been included in
consideration. It estimated that value of the premium at about Rs. 79 lakhs,
development charges at Rs. 2100 and therefore the stamp duly was calculated at Rs.
13, 34, 305. It also called for a penalty at 10 times. The District Registrar wrote
another letter to Collector (Stamps) on 22.4.88 stating that under the Rajasthan
Stamp Law Adoption Act as amended in 1982 the building machinery and furniture
etc. which are existing on the land is also conveyed with the lease as per the definition
of conveyance and the stamp duty should be payable as a conveyance under Article
23 ad valorem on market value. Referring to the Annual Report of BSL, it valued the
en tire properly at 14,31,17,661 and requested for initiating proceedings under Ss.
3,33,38,40, 47-C(1) (2) (3) and 47-A (1) (2) (3) of the Indian Stamps Act. On this
reference being made on 22nd April, 1988 to the Collector (Stamps), the Collector
(Stamps) (who also happened to be the District Collector, Bhilwara) ordered for"
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1102562/ 4State Of Rajasthan vs Bhilwara Spinners Ltd. And Ors. on 27 November, 2000
registering a case u/Ss. 3, 33, 38, 40, 47C(1) (2) (3) and 47(1)(2)(3) against the
respondent-petitioner company and to obtain a valuation report from the DRDA,
Bhilwara of the property existing at site on the land in question. A notice was issued
to the Managing Director, BSL on 26.4.88 informing that an enquiry in connection
with the supplementary lease deed registered on 28.3.88 is undergoing for which the
Assistant Engineer, DRDA, Bhilwara shall be coming on site where the representative
of the company may also remain present and make all the facilities available to the
said officer. However, without wailing for the report from DRDA, the Collector
(Stamps) on 28th April, 1988 recorded that since the report about the market value
of the property in question from DRDA will take enough time, the notice may be
issued to the BSL for levying stamp duly of Rs. 14,31,17,661 by treating the document
in question as conveyance on the basis of the valuation shown in the audited accounts
of the company and for levy of 10 times penalty. Thus, recording an order, the notice
dated 28th April, 1988 was issued by the Collector (Stamps) to the petitioner
company.
(6). The very same officer, who has granted approval to draft supplementary lease put
by the Joint Director of Industries before him as Collector and District Magistrate,
Bhilwara, and executed the supplementary lease deed for and on behalf of the
Governor of Rajas than on 25lh March 1988 and the said document having been
registered on 28th March, 1988 in his capacity as Collector (Stamps), opined it to be
not a supplementary lease dead or a lease deed but a conveyance of the entire unit of
the RSWM to BSL and initiated proceedings for charging the stamp duty on that
basis and levying of penalty for nonpayment of duly. Again in his capacity as
Collector and District Magistrate Bhilwara, by his order dated 30th April, 1988 he
executed a document cancelling the lease dated 25.3.88 vide Annex. P/11. The said
cancellation order recites that in accordance with Rule 9 of the Industrial Allotment
Rules, 1959 the lease deed should have been executed between Rajasthan Spinning
and Weaving Milts Ltd. and Bhilwara Spinners, the lessor being only a formal party
the supplementary lease deed dated 25.3.1988 is hereby cancelled'.
(7). This order led to filing of Writ Petition No. 1412/88 by the BSL challenging the
order of cancellation of the deed dated 25th March, 1988. The stand taken by the
State Govt. in the reply to the writ petition, No. 1412/88 which replied on behalf of all
the respondents including the Collector (Stamps), was:-
"The lease was originally executed in favour of M/s. Rajasthan Spinning and Weaving
Mills Limited and the lease hold rights could be transferred only by Rajasthan
Spinning and Weaving Mills Limited. The State Government after having rented the
lease hold rights to Ws. Rajasthan Spinning and Weaving Mills Ltd. was not
competent to execute a supplementary lease in favour of Ws. Bhilwara Spinning Mills
Ltd.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1102562/ 5State Of Rajasthan vs Bhilwara Spinners Ltd. And Ors. on 27 November, 2000
xxxxx The supplementary lease executed in favour of petitioner does not create any
right in favour of the petitioner. The petitioner No. 2 had sought permission from the
State Government to transfer his lease hold rights to petitioner No.1. The Stale
Government granted permission to the petitioner No. 2 to transfer its lease hold
rights to the petitioner No. 2. The State Government having granted lease in favour of
petitioner No. 1 was not competent to execute a supplementary lease deed in favour
of petitioner No. 2 and create fresh right in favour of petitioner No. 1. Unless and
until lease hold rights in favour of the petitioner No. 2 were cancelled and the land in
question reverted back to the State Government the lease deed in favour of the
petitioner No.1 could not be executed. Both these situation in the instant case have
not arisen, as such after grant of permission to the petitioner No.2 to transfer the
lease hold rights, the petitioner No.2 could have transferred the lease hold rights to
the petitioner No. 1. The State Government was not competent to execute any
supplementary lease deed in favour of petitioner No. 1 and create fresh rights in
favour of petitioner No. 1. When rights have been created by State Government in
favour of petitioner No. 2 it had no right to re-transfer the lease hold rights in favour
of the petitioner No. 1 till the lease in favour of the petitioner No. 2 was not cancelled,
expired and the property had reverted back to the State Government.
xxxxxx However it is submitted that no rights have been created in favour of the
petitioner No. 1 by the said supplementary lease deed. The supplementary lease deed
cannot be considered to be a part and partial of the earlier lease deed. Once the
petitioner No. 2 sought permission under Rule 9 to transfer lease hold right in favour
of the petitioner No. 1 the same has to be governed by Rule 9 and the transfer has to
be made by existing lease in favour of the prospective lessee. Since the present lease
deed was not executed by the petitioner No. 2 in favour of the petitioner No. 1 no
rights have been created by supplementary lease deed dated February 27, 1988.
xxxx If the transfer deed was executed by the petitioner No. 2 in favour of the
petitioner No. 1, the petitioners would have been required to pay proper stamps duly-
There was a mistake on the part of the respondents Stale Government in executing
the supplementary lease deed which is of no consequence as it does not create any
right in favour of the petitioner No.1".
(8). Thus, the categorical stand taken on behalf of all the respondents which included the State of
Rajasthan, the Collector & District Magistrate Bhilwara and the Collector (Stamps), Bhilwara, was
that under the instrument in question, subject matter of the present writ petition, neither any rights
were created or transferred in favour of BSL by the State nor the State was competent to do so. The
stand taken by the respondents was to be extent that not even the leasehold rights in favour of the
BSL could be created by the State for the remaining period of the lease which was sub- sisting
between the State and the RSWM vide Annex.P/2 dt.22.11.68. Inspite of these assertions ultimately
the order of cancellation of an instrument, which according to respondents was of no consequence,
was revoked, which is apparent from the fact that the writ petition No. 1412 of 1988 was got
dismissed by the counsel appearing for the State of Rajasthan by making a statement that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1102562/ 6State Of Rajasthan vs Bhilwara Spinners Ltd. And Ors. on 27 November, 2000
impugned order has been revoked.
(9). Meanwhile, the present petitioner had approached the Board of Revenue, challenging the
reference dated 22nd April, 1988 and notice issued on 28.4.88. By its order dated 20th May, 1988
(Annx. P/12), the Board of Revenue, stayed the implementation of the aforesaid two orders. The
revision filed before the Board of Revenue, arising out of the proceedings No. 2 of 1988 on the
record of the Collector (Stamps), was dismissed by the Board of Revenue on 26.8.96 as pre-mature,
holding that the company shall raise all the objections before the Collector (Stamps). Thereafter, on
6th March, 1997 by Annex.p/15, the Collector (Stamps) issued a notice in the proceedings marked as
65/97 calling upon the petitioner to show cause why stamp duty on the instrument in question be
not imposed as conveyance amounting to Rs. 2,43,21,965 and penalty in respect thereof. The
petitioner was required to appear on 7th March, 1997. The Collector (Stamps) was apprised by letter
dated 6th March, 1997 itself that 7th March, 1997 is a Gazetted holiday and it appears that the date
7th March, 1997 has beet) fixed inadvertently. The petitioner also demanded and requested to fix the
date of hearing giving a reasonable period. Apart from the written request by registered A.D., an
express telegram was also sent. Responding thereto hearing was refixed on 10th March, 1997 for
which notice was issued on 7th March, 1997 which undisputably was gazetted holiday. The
petitioner company also submitted a preliminary objection raising the question about propriety of
the proceedings taken in a hot haste without giving the requisite copies and chance to the petitioner
to enable it to produce evidence and examine witnesses and also raised objections as to the
jurisdiction invoked u/S. 47-C and 47-A of the Indian Stamps Act. It was also pointed out that
against the rejection of revision, the petitioner has also filed a review petition before the Board of
Revenue which is pending a well as a petition for making a reference to the High Court u/S. 57 of the
Indian Stamps Act. The petitioner has also produced the various applications made by it before the
Collector (Stamps) protesting against the denial of reasonable opportunity and non-recording of the
proceedings that transpired during the day which are Annx. P/19 submitted at 3.30 on 10.3.97,
Annex. 20 dated 11th March, 1997, Annex. 21 dated 11th March 1997 at 4.45 p.m. Annx. P.22 dated
11.33.97 at 5.10 p.m. Annex.P/23 dated 12th March, 1997 protesting against the closure of evidence
and demanding sufficient time to call for Power of Attorney residing at Delhi and to examine him
Annx. P/24 dated 12.3.97 was submitted al 2.30 p.m. demanding cross examination of the Sub
Registrar on the affidavit which was on record but was not presented during the presence of the
representative of the petitioner company or its counsel. The application dated 13th March, 1997 filed
al 4 p.m. requesting to adjourn the matter pointing out that in view of the manner in which the
proceedings are being fashioned, a writ petition has been filed in the High Court of Judicature for
Rajasthan at Jodhpur on that dale so as to enable the petitioner to await its outcome and another
application for seeking time to enable the Chairman of the company to appear before the Collector
(Stamps) and examine himself who was to return from abroad on 15.3.97. Yet another application
dated 13th March, 1997 was made alleging that the proceedings are being conducted in breach of
principles of natural justice by entertaining evidence on record in the absence of the parties. The
proceedings ultimately led to making of an order by the Collector (Stamps) on 13th March, 1997
itself levying difference of stamp duty of Rs. 2,43,20,885 and registration fee of Rs. 871 on the
instrument in question and penalty Rs. 2,43,641 to totalling to Rs. 4,86,42,641.

(10). Aggrieved with the aforesaid order, the petitioner had filed the writ petition No. 1480 of 1997
on 1st April, 1997 inter-alia on the ground that the proceedings conducted by Collector (Stamps)
were in violation of principles of natural justice and were in malafide exercise of the power, that the
Collector (Stamps) had no jurisdiction to invoke Sec. 47-A inasmuch as Sec. 47-A applies only in the
case of instruments relating to immovable properly chargeable with ad valorem duty on the market
value of the property as staled in the instrument. The instrument in question is a supplementary
lease deed where by the land in question has been leased in favour of the petitioner company on
which stamp duty is not paid ad valorem on market value of the properly but only on the basis of
annual rent reserved, that the State Government being the owner of the land alone and not of the
building and machinery thereon, no question of transferring or conveying of the buildings, plant or
machinery in favour of the petitioner under the instrument would arise for determining stamp duty
payable on the instrument in question. It was also urged that no question of conveyance within the
meaning of Sec. 2(10) of the Indian Stamps Act arise in the present case under the instrument in
question so as to invite attraction of Article 23.
(11). The respondents, apart from raising preliminary objection for not entertaining the writ petition
on the ground of availability of alternative remedy under Rule 73 of the Stamps Act to file revision
before the Board of Revenue, contended on the merit that notwithstanding the nomenclature and
apparent purport of the document, the authorities under the Stamps Act are entitled to go behind
the instrument to find out the true nature of the transaction and levy stamp duty which is payable
on execution of a conveyance deed to give effect to such transaction by construing the instrument in
question as evidence of conveyance of the immovable property comprised in the industrial unit
owned by the RSWM at Bhilwara to BSL, the petitioner, and as the Duty on conveyance is payable
ad valorem on the market value, the question of determination of the market value depends on
consideration of evidence and conclusion of fact, the matter should have been left to be decided by
the authorities under the statute.
(12). The learned Single Judge, considering the various aspects and facts of the case was not inclined
to accept the preliminary objection and non-suit the petitioner on the ground of availability of
alternative remedy. The learned Judge considered that the alternative remedy under the rules could
be availed only on deposit of 50% of the demand raised, which condition in the present facts and
circumstances was too onerous, to be treated as equally adequate and efficacious alternative
remedy, hence the Court would be justified in entertaining the writ petition notwithstanding the
availability of enunciated in Himmatlal Harilal Mehla vs. State of M.P. (1), M.G. Abrol, Addl.
Collector of Customs, Bombay vs. M/s. Shantilal Chhotelal & Co. (2), M/s. Filterco vs.
Commissioner of Sales Tax, M.P. (3) and Shrikant Kashinath Jituri vs. Corporation of the City of
Belgaum (4) that when the condition precedent for filing an appeal is deposit of substantial portion
of demand raised and about which no discretion vests in the authority for waiving the condition
even in appropriate cases, nor the deposit of demand is confined to the admitted sum of liability, the
remedy of appeal or revision cannot be said to be an alternative efficacious remedy. The learned
Single Judge also considered the issue in the light of the decision of the Supreme Court in A.V..
Venkateswaran, Collector of Customs, Bombay vs. Ramchand Sobhraj Wadhwani (5). Referring to
well known exception to the ordinary rule to avail the alternative remedy. The two well known
exceptions are that (1) where there is a complete lack of jurisdiction in the officer or authority to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1102562/ 8State Of Rajasthan vs Bhilwara Spinners Ltd. And Ors. on 27 November, 2000
take action impugned, or (2) where the order prejudicial to the petitioner has been passed in
violation of principles of natural justice. The two exceptions to the normal rule as to the effect of the
existence of an adequate alternative remedy are by no means exhaustive, and even beyond them a
discretion vests in the High Court to entertain the petition and grant the petitioner relief in
appropriate cases notwithstanding the availability of an alternative remedy. This must necessarily
depend on 'a variely of facts that govern the proper exercise of the discretion by the Court in the
mailer which is pre-eminently one of discretion, it is not possible nor desirable to lay down inflexible
rules which must apply in every case which comes before the Court. The Court also took into
consideration the fact that the petition was admitted on 11.4.97, the respondent had put appearance
and filed detailed return and the mailer was pending for considerable period. The learned Judge
also took into consideration the important questions of law required to be determined in the case,
which ultimately deserve to be decided by the High Court. The petition was admitted after hearing
present appellant who had entered caveat. The learned Judge did not find it proper to dismiss the
writ petition on the preliminary objection.
(13). On merit, the learned Judge found that where the law implies a surrender from the
unequivocal conduct of both the parties which is inconsistent with the continuance of the existing
lease, such a surrender is valid under Sec. 11(f) of the Transfer of Properly Act, there would be a
implied surrender when the lessor executes a new lease of some property at the request of the first
lessee. In the present case, a supplementary lease deed was executed on 25.3.88 on the request of
the original lessee RSWM in favour of the petitioner by the Govt. of Rajasthan after granting
necessary permission vide its order dated 14.7.83. The facts and circumstances clearly indicate that
there was implied surrender by the RSWM in favour of BSL and thereafter the lessor had entered
into a new lease agreement with BSL. The document dated 23.5.88 does not in any way indicate that
the transfer of lease is by way of an assignment by the RSWM in favour of BSL so as to attract the
provisions of Article 63 of Schedule I of the Rajasthan Stamp Laws Adoption Act, 1952 to levy a duly
as conveyance on consideration equal to the amount of market value of the property. Thus finding
that the transaction in question for the purpose of stamp duty clearly covered under Sec. 35(a)(iii) of
the Stamp Act as adopted and the Duty liviable is the same as on conveyance on the basis of the
amount of value of average annual rent, the Collector (Stamps) was clearly wrong when he assessed
the stamp duty by treating the supplementary lease deed executed by a State of Rajasthan & BSL as
conveyance of Bhilwara unit of RSWM to BSL and although the plant, machinery and building are
not mentioned in the lease deed dated 25.3.88, they were treated subject matter of the instrument
on which the petitioner is liable to pay stamp duty for transfer of the plant, building and machinery.
The order passed by the Collector (Stamps) was accordingly set aside and the petition was allowed.
(14). In the appeal, the appellant in the first instance contended that the learned Judge ought to
have dismissed the petition on the ground of availability of alternative remedy of filing revision
under Rule 73 of the Rajasthan Stamps Rules, 1973. However, in the facts and circumstances
narrated above, for the reasons already noticed, we are of the opinion that the discretion exercised
by the learned Single Judge in entertaining the petition inspite of availability of alternative remedy
on the ground of onerous nature of availability of the remedy, and keeping in view the facts and
circumstances of the present case, in the manner in which the proceedings have taken place and the
complexity of issues which is invoked, was justified and does not call for interference in the appeal
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1102562/ 9State Of Rajasthan vs Bhilwara Spinners Ltd. And Ors. on 27 November, 2000
on that ground.
(15). On the merit of the case, the thrust of the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant is
that notwithstanding the document apparently purports to be a document of creating lease hold
rights in favour of BSL by the State, it is in fact a conveyance of Bhilwara unit of RSWM which
includes leasehold rights also, alongwith plant and machinery and constructions thereon. Hence
Stamp Duly was payable on the market value of properly conveyed, it was contended by the learned
counsel for the appellant that Sec. 27 requires the parties to any document to give full and true
consideration and all other facts and circumstances affecting the chargeability of the document with
the duly or amount of duty with which it is chargeable and where the parties to instrument have nor
set forth all relevant facts and circumstances affecting the chargeability of the document with duty of
the amount or duty which is chargeable,' it is open for the stamp authorities to go behind the
instrument to unveil the real transaction beyond the instrument and levy duly thereon. In this
connection, it was contended that the plants and machinery which were permanently embedded to
the earth with an intention of running an industry and while embedding this machinery the
intention of the party was not to remove for the purpose of any sale of the same either as a part of
the machinery or as a scrap, such machinery being fixtures would themselves become part of
immovable property and will form part of the land, subject matter of transfer. According to learned
counsel merely because RSWM is not a party to instrument it would not make any difference if the
instrument in the background in which it is executed results in transferring the interest of the
RSWM under the scheme of transferring its unit at Bhilwara to BSL under the resolution dated
24.1.83, and therefore, a duty on the instrument shall be chargeable as on conveyance of the said
properly which includes the land, building standing therein and machinery embedded therein
including development charges leviable which go to constitute the market value of the entire
properly in question. For this proposition, the learned counsel relies on a decision of Supreme Court
in Duncans Industries Ltd. vs. State of U.P. (6), that where a factory is transferred as a going
concern which the vendor conveys under the deed of conveyance, the value of plant and machinery
can be taken into consideration for the purpose of stamp duly payable.
(16). Learned counsel also refers to the decision of the Supreme Court in Thayyil Mammovs.
Kottialh Rammuni (7), to contend that mere nomenclature of a document is not the conclusive proof
of the nature of the document and if on the correct construction of a document the stamp duty has
not been paid in accordance with law, the same can be recovered by invoking the provisions of Sec.
47-A and 47-C of the Act as adopted in Rajasthan. In this connection, reliance was also placed on a
decision of this Court in Bajaj Hindustan vs. Stale of Rajasthan (8), laying down that the valuation
for the purpose of stamp duty is to be made on the basis of what was sought to be really conveyed
through the instrument presented.
(17). Mr. Ray, Senior Advocate, appearing for the respondent company contended that the
document in question in any sense cannot be construed as an instrument of conveyance of factory
plant and machinery within the meaning of Sec. 2(10) of the Stamps Act for the purpose of
attracting applicability of Article 23. It was urged that the instrument in question being not a
document between RSWM and BSL, the nature of transaction between RSWM and BSL cannot be
subject matter of an enquiry while construing a document executed between the State Government
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1102562/ 10State Of Rajasthan vs Bhilwara Spinners Ltd. And Ors. on 27 November, 2000
and BSL. For the purpose of construing instrument neither the transaction between the persons who
are not parties to the instrument nor the properties which are not mentioned in the instrument at all
can be included for consideration. The duty payable under the Indian Stamps Act is on the
instrument and not on any transaction. If the instrument neither creates nor purports to create right
in any particular immovable property, the Instrument cannot be chargeable as an instrument
conveying any property not mentioned therein from a person not party to such an instrument. A
document of conveyance has to be inter vivos between two living persons conveying interest of one
to another. Mr. Ray contends that there was existing lease between the Stale of Rajasthan and
RSWM for 99 years which could be brought to an end by the act of the parties. If by the conduct of
the parties, the surrender of existing lease takes place then the lessoris free to create fresh lease in
favour of the third party. The transaction in such circumstances would again be only between the
lessor and the party in whose favour fresh lease or purported to be created is created under the
instrument in respect thereof the rights impliedly surrendered by the lessee but it cannot reach the
rights which were vesting in the lessee as owner of other properties and do not form part of the
surrender. In this connection, it was pointed out that the original lessee has obtained a permission
from the appellant to transfer his leasehold rights in favour of BSL vide grant dated 14.7.83, thus,
there was no impediment on RSWM to transfer the lease hold rights vesting in it. However, the
transfer of lease hold rights by the RSWM would not result in destroying the privity of contract
between the State and RSWM so as to absolve the RSWM of its obligations under the said lease
notwithstanding an assignment of lease. The assignee may also be responsible for payment of rents
and other obligations to the lessor. Thereafter, once the permission was granted by the State as
lessor to the RSWM to transfer its lease-hold rights on same terms of the conditions and it was part
of the condition of the sanction that a supplementary lease deed for the remainder period of the
lease shall be executed between the lessor and the assignee, the instrument of supplementary lease
deed dated 25.3.1988 can only be construed in that light. The transaction between RSWM and BSL
do not come into picture "at all. Moreover, in furtherance of this background when the previous
lessee RSWM walked out of the possession of the leased property viz. the land by putting BSL in
possession. In furtherance of the terms contained in sanction letter dated 14.7.83 the lessor and
assignee executed the supplementary lease deed on 25.3.88 to create a privity of contract between
the lessor and assignee directly which was an act inconsistent with the existing relationship of lessor
or lessee between the State of Rajasthan and RSWM, It amounted to surrenderor the leasehold
rights by the RSWM under the lease in favour of the Stale and thereafter by executing
supplementary lease deed the State Government only acted as it purported to have acted to create a
fresh lease in favour of BSL on consideration of annual rent of Rs. 1680 for the period of 72 years
mentioned in the instrument. Therefore, the question of conveyance of any property from RSWM to
BSL under the instrument simply do not arise. With these premise, the learned counsel contended
that the appeal deserves to be dismissed.
(18). We have carefully considered the rival contentions and perused the record. At the outset we
would invite our attention to definition of conveyance as given in the Indian Stamps Act, 1899 and
adopted in the Stale of Rajasthan, which reads as under:-
(10) "Conveyance" includes a conveyance on sale and every instrument by which
property, whether movable or immovable, is transferred inter vivos and which is not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1102562/ 11State Of Rajasthan vs Bhilwara Spinners Ltd. And Ors. on 27 November, 2000
otherwise specifically provided for by Schedule I."
(19). An analysis of the aforesaid provision makes it clear; (1) it applies to transfer to
properties whether movable or immovable; (2) that such transfer has to be made
inter-vivos and not by operation of law; (3) it expressly includes conveyance of
transfer of properly sale or other transfer of property and excludes such transfer
which are specifically provided for by Schedule-1.
(20). If we have a glance at it, the Schedule-1 refers to many modes of transfer like
transfer by way of exchange, gift, lease, mortgagee, release, surrender of lease under
different specified articles. All those modes of transfer are, therefore, excluded from
the expression 'conveyance' for the purpose of act, and an instrument of such other
modes of transfer is to be governed by such specific article and not by general
category of 'conveyance' under Art. 23 read with sec. 2(10). The question in the
present case posed is whether the instrument is an instrument of property mentioned
in the document of 'lease' or assignment of lease or 'conveyance' by way of transfer of
property from RSWM to BSL, as referred to above envisaged in Resolution of RSWM
dated 24.1.1938. Suffice it [o state that instrument of lease is provided for under
Article 35 and an instrument of assignment of lease under Art. 66. Both cannot be
construed as 'conveyance' for the purpose of the Act of 1899 as adopted by State of
Rajasthan. Apart from it, it has to be further noticed here that sub-sec. (10) of Sec. 2
refers to 'transfer inter-vivos' i.e. to say instrument of conveyance can only be such
instrument which refers to any transfer inter vivos. Thus, it makes clear that in order
that an instrument falls within the definition, it is necessary that it must effect a
present transfer of property, it purports to convey. It must be an instrument between
two living persons purporting to transfer the properly which is the subject matter of
instrument from one party to another. It cannot relate to a transfer of property which
is not a subject matter to the instrument. Nor it can relate to transfer of an interest of
a person who is not a party to such an instrument. That is to say, an instrument of
conveyance liable to duly under Art. 23 of the Schedule I of the Act is confined to the
transfer of immovable properties between the parties to the instrument and the
properties to which it relates. Within that precincts only, an enquiry as to the
construction of the instrument for the purposes of stamp duty could be under taken
under the provisions of the Act to the extent permissible. However, it cannot traverse
beyond the parties who have executed or on whose behalf the instrument has been
executed by authorized agents and property mentioned in the instrument to find out
the intention of the person who is not party to the instrument in respect of transfer of
the properly which is not subject matter to the instrument.
(21). The charge of the stamp duty is only on instrument and not on the transaction.
The subject matter of Duty is the instrument through which any property is
transferred or rights created, not any other transaction which may exist between the
parties but are not subject matter of instrument, which is to be construed and
subjected to levy in respect of property it deals with. Nor duty is leviable on any
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1102562/ 12State Of Rajasthan vs Bhilwara Spinners Ltd. And Ors. on 27 November, 2000
transaction that may exist between one or more parties to instrument and other
person or persons not party to the instrument, by holding an enquiry whether such
other transaction has been carried out in accordance with law or not.
(22). It becomes relevant to consider the meaning of expression instrument for the
purposes of the Act which has been defined under Sec. 2(14) :
(14) "Instrument" includes every document by which any right or liability is, or
purported to be created, transferred, limited, extended or extinguished or recorded".
(23). The aforesaid definition makes it clear that a document which either creates any
right or liability is created, transferred, extended, limited, extinguished or recorded
can fall within the category of instrument. Even if no such right or liability is created,
transfer, limited, extended, extinguished or recorded in fact but purports to create
transfer or record any right or a liability it may invite attraction of stamp duly. But,
obviously, the right or liability referred to under above definition can only relate to
the right or liability in respect of which the instrument has been executed. If any
transaction has been carried out between two parties without execution of an
Instrument, the provisions of the Stamp Act cannot be attracted on the assumption
that in order to create, transfer, limit, extend, extinguish or record validly what
instrument ought to be executed. In the absence of any document creating or
purporting to create any right or a liability, or purporting to create such right or
liability no provision of Stamp Act can be invoked for the purpose of levying Stamp
Duty by assuming existence of any document for the said purpose. Else, it would
amount to Duty on transaction and not duly on the instrument. The instrument is
chargeable even the transaction which it recorded or purports to record cannot be
effected. For example if a person having no interest in any property which he could
transfer executes a document purporting to transfer such interest in immovable
property, the document will attract Stamp Duty. Conversely also, as the Duty is on
the instrument even though where the parties have acted in furtherance of the
agreement between them by conducting their affairs accordingly but have not
executed any instrument to that effect, in the absence of any instrument to that effect
between the parties, no Duty under the Act can become chargeable.
(24). In connection with the aforesaid two definitions under the Stamp Act, it would
also be relevant to refer to some relevant provisions of the I transfer of Properties
Act. As the definition of conveyance under the Stamp Act refers to transfer of
property inter-vivos' but what is transfer of property inter-vivos is not defined under
the Stamp Act, to consider general law of transfer of property inter-vivos becomes
relevant. Sec. 5 of the Transfer of Properties Act reads as under:-
"5. In the following sections "transfer of property means an act by which a living
person conveys property, in present or in future, to one or more other living persons
or to himself, or to himself and one or more other living persons; and "to transfer
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1102562/ 13State Of Rajasthan vs Bhilwara Spinners Ltd. And Ors. on 27 November, 2000
property" is to perform such act.
In this section "living person" includes a company or association or body of
individuals, whether incorporated or not, but nothing herein contained shall affect
any law for the time being in force relating to transfer of property to or by companies,
association or bodies of individuals".
(25). The word "inter vivos" according to Bouvier's Law Dictionary (Volume II) means 'between two
living persons'. The illustration used is 'as a gift inter vivos which is made by one person to another
person'.
(26). In the Blacks Law Dictionary, expression inter vivos has been explained:
"Between the living; from one living person to another. Where property passes by
conveyance, the transaction is said to be inter vivos, to distinguish it from a case of
succession or devise. So an ordinary gift from one person to another is called a "gift
inter vivos," to distinguish it from a gift made in contemplation of death or a
testamentary gift'.
(27). Thus, the expression inter vivos refers to transfer or conveyance of the property
from one living person to another. Thus it is an act between two living persons who
are parties to such transaction which takes place between the two. The also is the
thrust of Sec. 5 of the Transfer of Property Act. It significantly is more clear and
explicit when it says that "transfer of property" means 'an act by which a living person
conveys property to one or more other living persons'. It is also to be noticed that Sec.
5 of the Transfer of Property Act also uses expression "conveys property" to denote
transfer of property. Therefore, the word "conveyance" of immovable property inter
vivos read in the aforesaid context clearly indicates that an instrument of conveyance
envisaged under the Stamp Act can only refer to such an instrument transferring or
purporting to the transfer or conveying property between two living persons who are
party to such instrument and not a stranger to instrument.
(28). Lord Grains while referring to expression "conveyance" has opined:
"There is no magical meaning in this word. It denotes an instrument which carries
from one person to another person in interest in land."
(29). From the chain of events noticed above, it is apparent that only the leasehold interest in the
land in question is demised by the State of Rajasthan, the owner and lessor by executing a deed in
1968. The lessor in the demised property had no other interest vesting in it at the time of grant of
lease in favour of the RSWM nor at any time it has acquired any interest in the industrial unit
established over the said plot in terms of the conditions of allotment by the RSWM. The industrial
unit was a property absolutely vesting in the RSWM. No interest in that unit as such vested in the
State Govt. which as a person it could convey on its own to any one. That is not even disputed by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1102562/ 14State Of Rajasthan vs Bhilwara Spinners Ltd. And Ors. on 27 November, 2000
appellant. Hence the instrument in question cannot be construed as an instrument creating any
right, which the conveying party to instrument viz. State of Rajasthan itself did not have. What the
document purports to convey obviously depend only on what property and interest has been made
subject of instrument and not beyond it. It therefore cannot be an instrument of conveyance within
the meaning of Section 2(10) read with Sec. 2(14) of, the Stamp Act.
(30). RSWM, when it decided to transfer its interest in its Bhilwara unit to another company to be
incorporated as its subsidiary company had envisaged a transaction between RSWM and BSL
namely between the two companies, one of which was holding company and the other was a
subsidiary company. As per provision of Sec.5 the two companies are to be deemed to be living
persons and transaction of transferring Bhilwara Unit from RSWM, one living person to BSI.,
another living person is a transfer or interest of RSWM to BSL inter- vivos. The Companies Act
envisages that any property in the company can be transferred by a resolution of General Meeting of
its Members authorising to transit the property. The transfer of Bhilwara unit as a while as going
concern involved transfer of all interests of the RSWM in the said unit including its lease-hold rights
in respect of land on which the industrial unit was established. But for the condition under the lease
deed dated 22.11.1968 and the Industrial Allotment Rules, 1959 the lessee could have assigned its
lease hold rights in terms of Sec. 108(j) of the Transfer of Property Act which envisages an implied
authority in the lessee to transfer the lease absolutely or by way of mortgage or sub lease the whole
or any part of his interest in the property and any transferee of such interest may again transfer it. It
also envisages that the lessee shall not by reason only of such transfer, cease to be subject to any of
the liabilities allaching to the lease. That is to say that the privity of contract between lessor and the
original lessee shall continue notwithstanding subsequent and successive assignments of the
leasehold rights of the original lessee. The result of assignment of leasehold right could create privity
of estate between the original lessor and the assignee but not privity of contract which continues
between the original lessor and the original lessee. In such event original lessee alone continue to be
reckoned as lessee and his transferee only gets the status of assignee under an independent contract
permissible under law. If the leasehold rights are assigned in favour of the lessor, it results in
extinguishment of lease as the right of the lessor in the lessee merges into one. If on assignment of
lease in favour of a third party the lessor executes a fresh lease in favour of assignee from a lessee to
his knowledge, it may bring to an end privity of contract between original lessor and original lessor
and assignee squeezing out the original lessee and the new contract results in fusion of privity of
contract once again between the lessee from the scene inasmuch as the execution of new lease deed
between the lessor and the lessee's assignee result in extinguishment of rights and obligations of the
original lessee by implied surrender and grant of fresh lease by the lessor in favour of the assignee.
This position has been stated in Woodfall's Law of Landlord and Tenant 26th Edition, Volume I
page 914.
"1997. The principle of surrender by operation of law. The term "surrender by
operation of law" or "implied surrender (there being no distinction) is the expression
used to describe all these cases where the law implies a surrender from unequivocal
conduct of both parties which is inconsistent with the continuance of the existing
tenancy. Thus it is properly applied to cases where the owner of a particular estate
has been party to some act having some other object than that of a surrender, but
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1102562/ 15State Of Rajasthan vs Bhilwara Spinners Ltd. And Ors. on 27 November, 2000
which object cannot be effected whilst the particular estate continues, and the validity
of which act he is by law estopped from disputing. Such surrender is the act of the
law, and takes place independently of, and even in spite of, the intention of the
parties. It is presumed to have preceded the act to which the tenant is party."
(31). Sec. III of the Transfer or Property Act which envisages the contingencies in which lease of the
immovable properly determines, includes 'determination of lease by implied surrender" too is in
consonance with above principles. In Mulla's Transfer of Property Act 9th Education the position
has been explained:-
Implied surrender or surrender by operation of law (1) by the creation of a new
relationship; or (2) by relinquishing of possession.
xxxxx The principle which governs the doctrine of implied surrender of a lease is that when a certain
relationship existed between two parties in respect of a subject matter and a new relationship has
come into existence regarding the same subject matter, the two sets cannot co-exist, being
inconsistent and incompatible between each other, i.e. if the latter can come into effect only on
termination of the former, then it would be deemed to have been terminated in order to enable the
latter to operate.
xxxxxxxxx There can be an implied surrender if the lessor grants a new lease to a third person with
the assent of the lessee of the existing lease who delivers the possession to such person or where the
lease directs his sub-tenant to pay the rent directly to a lessor".
(32). The principle has been accepted by the Supreme Court in PMC Kunhiraman Nair vs. C.R.
Naganatha Iyer (9).
"Under clause (f) of Sec. III of the Transfer of Property Act, 1908, implied surrender
is made for determination of a lease of immovable property. In English Law, delivery
of possession by the tenant to a landlord and his acceptance of possession effects a
surrender by operation of law. ... Just as under the English law, there can be an
implied surrender under the law of transfer of property in India, if the lessor grants a
new lease to a third person with the assent of the lessee under the existing lease who
delivers the possession to such person or where the leasee directs his sub-tenant to
pay the rent directly to a lessor."
(33). The same view has been expressed by this Court in Noratmal vs. Mohan Lal (10).
(34). In the light of aforesaid principle, it is clear that the RSWM had agreed to transfer its Bhilwara
unit which included the lease hold right in the land in question alongwith his other assets which
formed part of the Bhilwara unit to its wholly owned subsidiary company BSL. The State
Government as lessor has granted permission for such transfer of lease-hold rights in favour of BSL
for the land in question as required under the lease deed of 1968. In pursuance of the agreement
between the RSWM and BSL to convey its interest in Bhilwara unit with stipulation of transfer of its
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1102562/ 16State Of Rajasthan vs Bhilwara Spinners Ltd. And Ors. on 27 November, 2000
leasehold rights in absolute, BSL has been put in possession of the land in question after fulfilling
condition under lease agreement about which there is no dispute. This part of transaction is between
the RSWM and BSL. The instrument in question neither creates any such right in BSL by transfer of
any right of RSWM by Slate in fact, nor it purports to create such rights. By the instrument in
question dated 25th March, 1988 lessor has accepted the BSL as its lessee for the remainder of the
period and it has agreed to accept the rent directly from him. The assent of the original lessee for the
creation of new relationship between the lessor and his envisaged assignee is apparent from the fact
that it applied for permission of such transfers and the State Government has agreed to grant such
permission with the stipulation that a supplementary lease deed shall be executed by BSL in favour
of State Government acknowledging the State Government as its lessor. Thus, the continuance of the
existing lease between State of Rajasthan and RSWM become inconsistent with the continuance of
new lease between the State of Rajasthan and BSL having come into existence with the assent of the
original lessee, the rights of the original lessee stood surrendered. The original lease deed Ex. P/2, in
favour of RSWM, permission letter dated 14,7.1983 culminating into execution of supplementary
lease deed dated 25.3.88 in favour of BSL all relates to only one property namely lease hold rights in
the plot in question which originally stood created in favour of the RSWM, now stood created
between Slate Government and BSL vide Ex.P/4 resulting in surrender of lessee's right of the
RSWM extinguishing privity of contract between himself and the State Government on coming into
existence new privity of agreement between Slate of Rajasthan and BSL. Therefore, the instrument
in question which neither refers to any property other than the lease hold rights in the plot in
question neither purports to transfer any property other than property in question the lease hold
rights in the plot. It even does not convey any of rights of RSWM to BSL through the instrument, but
only the effect of creation of new right between the State of Rajasthan and BSL is that existing
privity of contract between State of Rajasthan & RSWM which still holds RSWM bound to Stale, is
extinguished.
(35). The instrument in question cannot be instrument of conveyance for transfer of properly other
than the property of State Government from State Government to respondent BSL. There was no
material or ground for the authorities acting under the Stamp Act to assume it being an instrument
of conveyance of property, inter-vivos from RSWM to BSL on any principle of transfer of property
from one living person to another living person as a transaction inter-vivos either in the light of the
definition of conveyance under Sec. 2(10) of the Indian Stamps Act or the transfer of properly
defined under Transfer of Property Act. In our opinion, the transfer of Property inter-vivos under
Stamp Duty Act cannot be different and distinct from the transfer of property under Sec. 5 of the
Transfer of Property Act. Nexus between the two is clear. Sec. 2(10) refers the conveyance to mean
transfer of property inter-vivos by way of sale or other methodology not specifically provided under
Schedule I of the Act of 1899, and Transfer of Property Act, which deals with the substantive law on
transfer of immovable property too envisages transfer of immovable property mean conveying the
property from one living person to another living person i.e. transfer inter-vivos.
(36). The authorities under the Stamps Act apparently were labouring under the obsession of the
transaction of transfer of a going unit from RSWM to BSL without referring to any instrument, if
any executed between the two living person concerned viz. RSWM and BSL creating or purporting
to create rights in the properties constituting Bhilwara unit of RSWM in favour of BSL. The question
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1102562/ 17State Of Rajasthan vs Bhilwara Spinners Ltd. And Ors. on 27 November, 2000
about levy and collect stamp duly in respect of conveyance of any property from RSWM to BSL,
could only refer to an instrument of conveyance executed and existing between the said two
companies and not to any other instrument. The ground on which the proceedings have been
commenced against BSL in respect of instrument dated 25.3.88, in our opinion were non existing
and no person reasonably instructed in law vested with authority to exercise under the provisions of
Stamp Act could have reason to hold that the instrument dated 25.3.1988 was an instrument of
conveyance of Bhilwara unit of RSWM which includes the building, plant and machinery and other
fixtures other than lease hold rights in the plot in question from RSWM to BSL. The instrument
could have only been confined to any right or liability created or purported to have been created
between the parties to instrument in respect of the property or properly mentioned in the
instrument. The authorities could not travel beyond the instrument to include interest of persons
not parties to instrument or properties not refereed to in the instrument. The exercise of construing
the nature of transaction emanating from instrument subjected to duty Court only be confirmed to
creation of rights, liabilities and obligation created or purported to be created between parties to the
instrument and to the properties mentioned in the instrument. If it were to be treated as
conveyance, it could be only conveyance from Slate of Rajasthan to the BSL in the property
mentioned in the instrument. It may again be pertinent to recall here that with reference to the
reasons stated above that the instrument of conveyance in question should either create some rights
in fact or purport to create-rights which it really does not or could not create. Obviously, the
instrument in question does not purport to create any right through transfer or conveyance of
immovable properly except by creation of lease. It does not purport to transfer the land in question
by sale from State of Rajasthan to BSL. In fact, it cannot and does not create any other right between
the parties other than the lease in respect of any property other than plot in question inasmuch at no
point of time the properly in the building, plant & machinery and fixtures on the land in question in
which the lease hold rights were held by the RSWM became part of the ownership of the State of
Rajasthan by any mode of conveyance or by operation of law so as to become a part of the land
which could be conveyed to the BSI. by State of Rajasthan.
(37). By any stretch of imagination it cannot be suggested, nor it has been suggested, that State
Govt. was a party to the instrument as an agent or attorney of RSWM, who intended and did
executed the instrument to transfer any property of RSWM to BSL, or a party to devise adopted to
avoid Stamp Duty for the benefit of transferee. As a matter of law State could not transfer any
property of RSWM. As a matter of intention the Stale did not purport to transfer properly of RSWM.
Hence the instrument in question neither can be an instrument that created a conveyed property of
RSWM to BSL, nor it purported to do so. It, therefore, cannot be held an instrument of 'conveyance'
on other count.
(38). Even assuming that the implied surrender of the lease, the developments made on the land in
question becoming part of the land became part of the land and reverted to the Stale, still it being
not a transaction from Stale to the BSL was only a transaction of lease of the land as it stood which
was the property of the State Government, in favour of the lesseee BSL and a lease executed on
25.3.88 which was only liable to duty under Article 35 on the annual rating value. Article 35 reads as
under:-

average annual rent reserved.
(iv) xxxxxxxxxxx XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
(v) xxxxxxxxxxxx XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
(b) Where the lease is granted for a fine of premium or for money advanced and where no The same
duty as on a Conveyance (No. 23) for a consideration equal lo the amount or value of such fine or
premium or advance as setforth in the lease.
(39). The stamp duty is payable for consideration equal to the amount or value of the average annual
rent reserved. As neither the original lease was granted for a premium or for money advance nor
under the instrument in consideration any pre-
mium or money advance is payable as term of lease, the operation of sub-clause (b) of Article 35
does not arise- There was no room at any point of time to include the value of the estimated
premium which the State Govt. ought to have charged-under the Industrial Allotment Rules as have
been envisaged in show cause notice referred to above. It is significant to note that stamp duty is
chargeable on consideration equal to amount of value of fine, premium or advance as set forth in the
lease. The stamp duly is payable on an instrument of lease on premium on a consideration charged
as set forth in the instrument but not on consideration chargeable under the rules which in Fact has
not been charged. Obviously, non- charging of premium under the Industrial Allotment Rules is
another circumstance which goes to show that it was an execution of lease simplicitor for creating
privity of contract between the owner State of Rajas-
than with BSL, as a lessee. Nothing more nothing less. The State Government has not purported to
assign or transfer the lease hold rights of RSWM to BSL under the instrument in question nor it
could, nor the documents actually results in assigning of right of RSWM to BSL by dint of the said
instrument so as to construe assigning of lease with in Article 63.

(40). The apprehension and anxiety behind the action taken by the Stamp Duty authorities
concerning the avoidance of payment of stamp duty on the conveyance from RSWM to BSL also
appears to be ill founded. It would be apposite to invite attention to the provisions of Transfer of
Property Act. Sec. 5 of the Transfer of Property, Para 2 of which clearly envisages that the provisions
of Transfer of Property Act shall not affect any law for the time being in force relating to transfer of
property to or by companies, associations or bodies of individuals. That is to say, special law for the
companies in relation to the transfer of their properties shall prevail over the Transfer of Property
Act. Though the question whether the properly of the RSWM stood transferred to BSL in accordance
with as an inter-vivos transfer is not a subject matter of enquiry. However, it is relevant to consider
that provisions of Sec. 5 of the Transfer of Properly Act envisages exclusion of applicability of
Transfer of Property Act in relation to the transfer of properties of the companies in accordance with
the Companies Act if any special provisions are made thereunder.
(41). Under the provisions of the Companies Act, the special methodology is provided for entering
into compromise which includes re-construction by amalgamation of two companies or by having of
the assets of the companies under the provisions of Sec. 391 to 394 of the Companies Act, 1956. If on
result of scheme sanctioned by the Court reconstruction of existing company, or amalgamation of
two companies or a compromise is sanctioned and implemented under which property of one
company stands transferred to another company by dint of the orders of the Court, and the property
of one company stands transferred to another by operation of law, such transfer shall be governed
by the provisions of the Companies Act. Whether the conveyance of the Bhilwara unit of RSWM to
BSL has taken place under any special provision of the Companies Act is not the subject matter of
enquiry in these proceedings and could not be a subject matter of enquiry under the impugned
notice to hold and raise a demand on the premise that the RSWM could not have transferred the
property without execution of a registered deed in favour of BSL. We have noticed above that so far
as conveyance or transfer of property of RSWM to BSL is concerned, the plea of the company has
been that such transfer has taken place in accordance with provisions of Companies Act by issuing
shares. Whether in fact a valid transfer of Bhilwara Unit of RSWM to BSL has taken place in
accordance with law or not or any documentation between the two companies attracting Stamp
Duty has taken place or not can only relate while construing instrument, if any, to that effect. But
not while construing the instrument in question to which such transaction is foreign. If no valid
conveyance of property of RSWM to BSL has taken place, it will have different consequence of its
own oh the affairs of the companies concerned when the question arises which dealing with question
whether such properties validly vested in BSL.
(42). Moreover, the requirement of registration and payment of stamp duly are two different
requirements. It is not necessary whether a document is required to be necessarily registered is also
required to be stamped necessarily. Under Stamp Act a remission is operating on transfer of
properties from holding company to its subsidiary company. The transfer from RSWM to BSL was
transfer to a 100% subsidiary company. Under Sec. 9 of the Indian Stamps Act Notification No. 1
had been issued on 16th January, 1937 by the Central Board of Revenue granting a general
remission on Stamp Duty chargeable on conveyance of any property from holding company of its
subsidiary company in the following terms:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1102562/ 20State Of Rajasthan vs Bhilwara Spinners Ltd. And Ors. on 27 November, 2000
"(1) Where at least 90 per cent, of the issued share capital of the transferee company
is in the beneficial ownership of the transferor company, or
(ii) Where the transfer takes place between a parent company and a subsidiary
company one of which is the beneficial owner of not less than 90 per cent, of the
issued share capital of the other, or
(iii) Where the transfer takes place between two subsidiary companies in each of
which not less than 90 per cent of the share capital is in the beneficial ownership of a
common parent company;
Provided that in each case a certificate is obtained by the parties from the officers appointed in this
behalf by the Local Government concerned that the conditions above prescirbed are fulfilled."
(43). That notification was designed to facilitate reconstruction of a Company or amalgamation of
two Companies which are more or less under same ownership so that they may be able to rearrange
their affairs without being saddled with liability for payment of Stamp Duties. The Rajasthan State
has by the Rajasthan Stamp Law (Adaptation) Act, 1952 has adapted the Indian Stamps Act subject
to provisions made in the Adaptation Act, For coming to conclusion whether Stamp Duty was at all
leviable on the alleged conveyance of property from RSWM to BSL would have required
consideration of question about the consequence of adaptation of Indian Stamp Law by providing
that the Indian Stamp Act 1989 of the Central Legislation as amended from time to time, shall apply
to the whole of the State of Rajasthan w.e.f. 1.4.58, on the applicability of such notifications under
Indian Stamps Act prior to 1.4.58 and were in force, within the Stale of Rajasthan as on that date
particularly when no provision to the contrary has been made in the Adaptation Act to affect the
operation of notification for relaxation of the provision of the Act, particularly in the cases of general
remission like the one under Notification dated 16.1.1937. It would also entail and enquire into
question as to difference between legislation by incorporation and adaptation of an operative statute
for continued operations subject to provisions made to the contrary in Adaptation Act. Prima facie it
appears to us that there is a vital difference between legislation by incorporation, and adaptation of
existing law to operate in the given territory subject to adaptations made by the legislature adapting
the same to operate within the territorial region of its operative field. In the former it is a case of
enactment afresh to cover the field so far uncovered by the legislative field open for legislature, by
bodily lifting the provision of another statute by incorporating Word's by word as a part of
enactment being made, resulting in repeal of all previous laws operating in the field. In the case of
adaptation, what is enacted is the adaptation of provisions as implemented to continue to operate
within the occupied field, except to the extent adaptation made. In other words, adaptation is
method of legislation by which law in operation is adopted for continued operation as it is, subject to
the provisions made afresh in the adapting enactment. In such event, it stands to reason that
sub-ordinate legislation which is operative law, remains in continued operation, unless independent
or contrary provisions are made in adapting statute. However as the question about the levy of
Stamp Duty From RSWM to BSL was not at all subject matter of enquiry, nor was within the scope
of enquiry in construing the nature of instrument, we refrain from probing into this question further
and do not express any final opinion. This aspect has been noticed only to point out that an enquiry
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1102562/ 21State Of Rajasthan vs Bhilwara Spinners Ltd. And Ors. on 27 November, 2000
into the question of levy of Stamp Duty on any conveyance from RSWM to BSL would have entirely
different scope that the construction of instrument between State of Rajasthan and BSL which
enquiry cannot travel beyond the right of the parties to instrument in the property named and dealt
with in the instrument and nature of their dealing in the instrument so as to determine the true
nature of business transacted between the parties to the instrument in respect of properly
mentioned therein.
(44). That apart whether the deed of conveyance between RSWM and BSL of Bhilwara Unit under
the instrument dated 19th Jan., 1985, (produced alongwith the application dated 23rd March, 2000
in this appeal) creates or purports to create any right or liability amounting to conveyance or subject
to stamp duty under any provision and whether any proper stamp duty has been paid thereon or not
is not the subject of enquiry here but the fact remains that the present petitioner-respondent claims
to have acquired interest of the RSWM in its Bhilwara Unit by dint of issuing shares. If the Bhilwara
Unit stood validly transferred by the act of transferor company RSWM to transferee company BSL it
would not change the character of the present instrument. It is independent of the transaction
between RSWM and BSL. The instrument in question relates to creation of lease in favour of BSL by
the appellant resulting in fusion of privity of contract and privity of estate between the parties
namely State of Rajasthan and BSL. If there is no valid transfer of the Bhilwara Unit from RSWM to
BSL, the creation of leasehold right in the land in question would not result in creation of any right
in the properties of RSWM in BSL nor the instrument purports to create such rights. Therefore, the
instrument cannot be treated to be an instrument creating or purporting to create interest in the
property of RSWM in favour of BSL so as to invite consideration of construing the instrument as
conveyance from RSWM to BSL. It is not even the case of appellant that instrument is a conveyance
from State Government to the transferee BSL. It would be suffice to refer to the stand taken by the
State of Rajasthan, Collector Bhilwara and Collector (Stamps) in response to Writ Petition No. 1412
of 1988 quoted in extenso in narration of facts. It is the undisputed case of the present appellant that
a supplementary lease deed was not required and in fact did not create any rights in favour of the
BSL from the State Government inasmuch as the State Government could not create any right in the
property in question in favour of BSL. Therefore, when admittedly, the one of the executants namely
the State Government could not create any right in the properly of RSWM in favour of BSL, the
document can only be read as what it purports to be namely the creation of lease which, it purports
to create atleast in favour of BSL for a period of 72 years for which annual rent is reserved as Rs.
1680/-. The stamp duty is chargeable only on that basis.
(45). Sec. 2(xiv) excludes from the perview of conveyance any transfer of immovable property which
is not otherwise specifically provided for by schedule I. Lease is mode of transfer specifically
provided under Art. 35 of Schedule I of the Indian Stamp Act and transfer of lease by way of
assignment vide Art. 63 of the Schedule I of Indian Slamp Act. Thus whether it be a lease or
assignment of lease, it cannot be an instrument of conveyance.
(46). We are therefore, in agreement with the conclusion reached by the learned Single Judge for the
reasons aforesaid that the instrument is a lease-deed and chargeable to duty under Article 35(a)(iii)
of the Rajasthan Stamps Act and the duty leviable is the same as on conveyance on the consideration
equal to the amount of the average annual rent reserved.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1102562/ 22State Of Rajasthan vs Bhilwara Spinners Ltd. And Ors. on 27 November, 2000
(47). There is yet another aspect of the matter which may be noticed. It has been the case of the
appellant that by the methodology adopted by RSWM the property in question has not been
transferred and the transfer has been complete only by execution of supplementary lease deed. If
that is so, it becomes a case where there are several instruments for completing the transaction. In
that event u/S. 4 only the principal instrument is to be charged with the duly prescribed under
Schedule I for the conveyance of mortgage or settlement and each of the several instrument will be
chargeable with the duty of Rs. 1/- (now Rs. 2) only if any duty is prescribed in that provision.
Obviously, on the facts narrated above, as per the appellants the instrument between RSWM and
BSL, if any, does not complete the transaction; between them and for completion of transaction,
supplementary lease deed Ex. 3 was also required to be executed by the State. In that event, the
principal instrument of sale or conveyance as a result of agreement between RSWM and BSL would
be the instrument executed between those two companies as parties to transaction. The execution of
supplementary lease deed to complete the transfer of lease hold rights in the plot over which the
Bhilwara Unit was existing is only a document incidental to complete the formality of transfer of the
lease-hold rights in land as component of the property in its entirely, and therefore, only the
instrument executed between the principal parties to the traps- action namely RSWM and BSL
would attract the Duty as conveyance, if the same is liable to stamp duty, which is alleged to be by
the respondent as annexure alongwith the application referred to above in this appeal and the
document in question Annx.P/3 can only be considered as an incidental document chargeable with
fixed fee of Re.1. Further, in such event, it is the option of the parties to the transaction to determine
between themselves which of the documents shall for the purpose of Sec. 4 of the Stamp Duty Act be
deemed to be principal document. In the absence of any option exercised by the parties, incidental
instrument cannot be deemed to be principal document so as to attract the duty chargeable on the
principal document as conveyance.
(48). It has been urged by learned counsel for the State that instrument in question makes a
mention of transaction between original lessee RSWM and its assignee BSL, therefore the said
transaction is subject matter of the instrument in question. We are unable to accept. Merely because
a reference has been made in the instrument to the original lease, and" about the sanction granted
in favour of the RSWM and the transaction between RSWM and BSL, it does not amount to be
incorporating, the terms and conditions of transaction between RSWM and BSL, as the terms and
conditions of the agreement between State of Rajasthan and BSL as part of the instrument in
question. To draw any such inference, if must be clearly shown that the parties to the instrument
intended to incorporate them in the deed. In this connection, attention may be invited to the
decision of the Supreme Court in Himalaya House Co. vs. Chief-Controlling Revenue Authority (11).
It was a case in which a person obtained a laid on lease from the Government and constructed a
building thereon consisting of several flats, offices and shops. Under various agreements, he appears
to have assigned the right of occupation to several persons. The occupants formed a company under
the Companies Act. Lessee executed deed whereby he surrendered right in the land in favour of the
company for no consideration. The authorities under the Stamp Act sought to levy the stamp duly
on the said instrument executed between the person holding lease hold rights from the Govt. and
the company in whose favour these lease hold rights were assigned for no consideration as
conveyance of the properly. The value of consideration was sought to be taken as the total amount
received from the occupants of the flats under agreements executed between the original lessee and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1102562/ 23State Of Rajasthan vs Bhilwara Spinners Ltd. And Ors. on 27 November, 2000
the occupants on the like plea as has been raised before us. The Court rejected the contention of the
revenue while allowing the appeal by the assignee and held that there was no basis to hold that
consideration in the total amount received under the agreements between him and the persons to
whom he had. assigned certain rights in the flats, offices and shops in the building, those persons
had independent right of their own, their rights did not flow from the impugned Assignment Deed.
Whether the litle obtained by them was perfect or not, there is no denying of the fact that they had
acquired valuable rights even before the impounded deed was executed.
(49). With the parity of reasonings, it can be said that the consideration that was passed from BSL to
RSWM for conveyance of the property comprised in Bhilwara Unit from RSWM is, independent of
the instrument in question. Whether the title obtained by BSL from the RSWM was perfect or not is
also independent of the instrument in question and that cannot affect the Stamp Duty payable on
construction of instant document as executed between the State of Rajasthan and the BSL on the
premise of their respective position vis a vis the property described in the instrument.
(50). The decision relied on by the learned counsel for the appellant namely Duncans Industries
Limited vs. Stale of U.P. & Ors. (supra), in our opinion is of little assistance in the present case, it
was a case in which ICI India Ltd., a company registered under the Companies Act had executed an
agreement of sale dated 11.11.93 wherein it agreed to transfer on "as is where is" and as a going
concern" its fertilizer business of manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of urea fertilizer
in favour of CCFCL, renamed as M/s. Duncans Industries Limited for Rs. 70 crores which was
termed as "slump price" in the agreement. It was in relation to an instrument between the parties to
the transaction of conveyance that a question arose whether the immovable property under the
conveyance on which stamp duty was payable and valorem at market value would include plant and
machinery and land building thereon because the agreement was to transfer the immovable
property was on 'as is where is' basis. It is apparent that the conveyance of property under the
instrument was not in dispute. What was in dispute was which part of the transferred property
consisted of immovable property so as to invite attraction of ad valorem stamp duty on its market
value. We are not here concerned with a case where the question of market value of the properly
described in the instrument itself is to be considered, (51). The other decision relied on by the
learned counsel for !he appellant is Bajaj Hindustan Limited (supra). This decision rather helps the
respondents that the appellant. IT was a case in which M/s. Bajaj Hindustan Limited had
transferred its factory to M/s. J.K. Udaipur Udhyog Ltd. in the year 1993. The plant and machinery
and EDPS of the cement undertaking were not mentioned in any of the documents as property
conveyed under the instruments in respect of which market value of the property was enquired by
the authority under the Stamp Act. On the aforesaid omission being challenged in the Court, the
Division Bench of the High Court found that whereas the main contention sought to be made by the
petitioners is that the plant and machinery and electrical and EDP of the cement undertaking were
separately transferred by delivery of possession vide receipt dated 1.12.1993, the respondents
(Stamp Duty Authorities) in their valuation have purported to value such plant and machinery and
electrical and EDP in respect of which no document was presented or lodged by the petitioners
before the respondents for registration. The Court said:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1102562/ 24State Of Rajasthan vs Bhilwara Spinners Ltd. And Ors. on 27 November, 2000
"The said plant and machinery and electrical and EDP are extraneous to the five
documents lodged for registration. The respondents white seeking to include the
value of such assets in the value of the properties mentioned in the five documents
lodged for registration have gone beyond the documents presented for registration in
complete disregard of the charging Sec. 3 of the Indian Stamp Act as adopted in the
State of Rajasthan. List of assets which were transferred separately by delivery of
possession on 1.12.1993 was made over to the respondents on or about 4th October,
1994. The respondents thus while seeking to value those properties which were
extraneous to the five documents lodged for registration are in fact seeking to
re-write the documents presented for registration which is not permitted in law".
We are in respectful agreement.
(52). The same view was taken in Mohd. Hussain vs. District Registrar (14) wherein it has been held
that it is only the instrument that is presented for registration that should be charged with the stamp
duty. The authorities cannot look into the various documents that are connected with it with a view
to judge the nature of the transaction that is covered by this document read in conjunction with
several others.
(53). In view of our conclusion on the merit of the issue, we are not examining the other issues
raised before us by the learned counsel for the respondents namely whether power u/S. 47-A or 47-
C could have at all been invoked in the present case by the Collector (Stamps) when the stamp duty
payable on the instrument was not as per market value but was only on the consideration.
(54). Even if it be treated as an assignment of lease as on the date the instrument was executed, the
stamp duty was payable not on the market value but on the consideration at the rate applicable to
the conveyance of such value.
(55). Another contention raised by the learned counsel is that the power has been invoked mala fide.
(56). Having agreed with the conclusion reached by the learned Single Judge about the true nature
of the instrument and its chargeability to the stamp duty under Article 35, we are of the opinion that
prima facie case of malice in law appears to have been made out. The manner in which the
proceedings have taken place, the fact that the very same officer has accorded approval for execution
of a supplementary lease deed on behalf of the State of Rajasthan which was in consonance with the
conditions of permission granted vide Annex. P/3 dated 14.7.83 and the said document having been
registered on 25th March, 1983, the Sub Registrar barely three days thereafter makes a reference to
treat it not as a supplementary lease under Article 25-A but a fresh lease yet thereafter another
reference is made by the Registrar of the Stamp on 28th April, 1988 to the Collector (Stamps), who
is the same officer as District Collector who had executed the document in question slating to treat
the supplementary lease a document of conveyance of the property from RSWM to BSL. Taking
notice of the said reference on the very date, the Stamp Collector made an order for appointing
DRDA for valuing the market value of the property which is apprehended to be a subject matter of
conveyance. Then after directing the DRDA to appoint, a person and submit a report of valuation,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1102562/ 25State Of Rajasthan vs Bhilwara Spinners Ltd. And Ors. on 27 November, 2000
the said officer without waiting for the report, on the very same day decides to accept the valuation
disclosed by the Registrar in his communication dated 28th April, 1988 on the basis of Audited
Annual Accounts of the Company 1986 and issues a notice describing the amount of duty and
penalty to be levied thereon to show cause against it. Having issued this notice by treating it to be a
document of conveyance resulting in creation of right in property, subject matter of transaction
between RSWM and BSL, in his capacity as District Magistrate, Bhilwara, cancels the said lease by
holding that it was not required to be executed at all and when the order of cancellation is
challenged, a categorical stand is taken that the document in question does not purport to transfer
any interest in favour of BSL by the State Government inasmuch as State Government had no
interest on that date and persuades this Court to dismiss the writ petition. One fails to comprehend
that when all concerned viz. the State of Rajasthan, the District Collector, the Collector (Stamps)
unanimously held that the view that the Stale of Rajasthan the designated lessor or the transferee
under the instrument did not have any interest in properly which it could have transferred, and the
document was a superfluous act, any belief at all could be held by the Collector stamps at any time
that it created as interest in property of Bhilwara Unit by way of conveyance and construing the
document to be a document of conveyance which it did not ever purport to be. Then the order of
cancellation of cease has been revoked only in 1997 and thereafter the manner in which the hearing
has been fixed and adjudicated by the then Collector (Stamps) particularly keeping in view that the
date of hearing was fixed on a holiday and when pointed out that it was a gazetted holiday, notice
fixing next date was still issued on gazetted holiday as if even a delay of one day in fixing the date
was not palatable. Ignoring the fact that until 1997 the proceedings were stayed under the orders of
competent superior court. He refused to grant opportunity to the company for even producing
relevant documents or calling upon its senior executive to be examined as witness and refused to
supply document which formed the foundation for initiating the proceedings. The chain of events
clearly indicates that the decision to impose the stamp duty and penalty was a pre-determined. We
leave it at that.
(57). As a result of above discussion, this appeal fails and is hereby dismissed. There shall be no
orders as to costs.
