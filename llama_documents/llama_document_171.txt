and connected petitions 11 absolute bar against the previous statement made before the police
officer being used for any purpose whatsoever except provided in the proviso and 162(2). There is no
reference to the word "witness" in section 162(1) CrPC. The proviso refers to a witness in the context
of use of his previous statement, if any suffered by him to the police officer. The bar against
obtaining signature of the person being examined by the police officer, if his statement is recorded
in writing, is meant to protect the interest of accused from being prejudicially affected by any
dishonest or questionable methods adopted by police officer.
Statements recorded under Section 161 CrPC, reduced into writing, if duly proved, may be used by
the accused to contradict such witness and the procedure for contradiction is stipulated in Sections
145 Evidence Act, 1872. The prosecution may with the permission of Court, in certain circumstance,
use the statement under Section 161 CrPC to contradict the witness and when any part of such
statement is so used, any part thereof may also be used in the re-examination of such witness for the
purpose of explaining any matter referred to in his cross-examination.

The panel has gone through the all the above judgments and has found nothing in the said
judgments suggesting that Section 162 CrPC is meant for the protection of witness. The reasoning
assigned by the objectors is found to be untenable.
The aforesaid view is also supported by the commentary of "Sohoni's Code of Criminal Procedure
21st Edition, Justice ML Singhal, volume 2, LexisNexis pp.
830-837"; B.B. Mitra on Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, Volume I, 21st Edition (2011), page 768;

the view that the official answer key is correct.

interpretation of term "mesne profits"
defined in section 2(12) CPC as he alternatively considered the case of the appellant for damages or
compensation under the law of tort. With due deference to the aforesaid authority, the Court,
however, did not consider the effect of the remaining part of the provision on the interpretation of
the aforesaid expression as well as its historical evolution.
No doubt mesne profits as defined under Section 2 (12) CPC employs the expression "property"
without any qualification, however, it talks about those profits which a person has actually received

Question No.37 is answer "C" and the reasoning of which is duly Supported by Law is stated as
below:
Jurisdiction of Court is broadly of 3 types:
Subject matter Jurisdiction: If court doesn't have subject matter jurisdiction, then the
decision/decree is void and cannot operate as res judicata.
Territorial Jurisdiction: If court does not have territorial jurisdiction, then the
decision/decree is not void and can still operate as res judicata if there was no

Pecuniary Jurisdiction: If Court does not have pecuniary jurisdiction, then also
decision/decree is not void and can still operate as res judicata if there was no

said provision makes it clear that in the cases of lack of Territorial and pecuniary
jurisdiction, it is more of an administrative and technical defect and it does not hit

void only when there was a consequent failure of the justice and the defendant was
prompt enough to have raised the objection in the trial court at the earliest possible
opportunity. Therefore, the answer "C" to the question no.37 of Code A would be the
correct and the right answer and the same ought to be changed by the respondents
despite submitting the objections.

It further transpires from the judgment that principal reliance was placed on the case of Narasimha
Rama Rao V. Venkataramanayya AIR 1940Mad768. Reading of the aforesaid judgment indicates
that the question considered by the full bench was whether an income tax return or statement filed
in support of it, is a public document and answered the same in the affirmative. In para 9, it is
recorded as follows:
"9. As the learned Judges who have made the reference have pointed out, a plaint or a written
statement has always been regarded by this Court as forming part of the record of a case and a
public document of which an interested party may obtain a certified copy. If the 17 of 51 Neutral

and connected petitions 18 argument, that an Income Tax return is not a public document, but that
the order passed thereon is, were carried to its logical conclusion, it would mean that no part of the
record of a civil suit could be regarded as constituting a public document except evidence recorded
by the Court or summonses or notices or interlocutory orders or the judgment in the case. In
BhagainMeghBaneeKoer v. GoorooPetahad Singh (1876) 25 W.B. 68 Garth, C.J. and Birch J.
expressly held that a petition which was the subject-matter of an order passed was part of the record
in the suit, and I do not think that this can reasonably be doubted.
In my judgment, it would be putting an unwarranted restriction on the words "documents forming
the acts or re. cords of the acts" to say that they should be confined to those parts of an Income Tax
record which the Income Tax Officer has himself prepared and to exclude documents which he has
himself called for or which have been admitted to the record for the purposes of the assessment. I
consider that the record of an Income Tax case must be regarded as the record of the acts of the
Income Tax Officer in making his assessment and therefore that any document properly on the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56624229/ 18Navdeep Kaur vs State Of Punjab And Others on 1 June, 2023
record is just as much a public document as the final order of assessment. For these reasons I would
answer the question propounded in the affirmative. I would make the costs of this reference costs in
the cause".
The aforesaid observation was made only in the context of considering the question as to whether
Income tax return is a public document or not.
In the light of aforesaid discussion though the panel is of the view that the pleadings (plaint and
written statement) are not considered to be public documents under section 74 of Indian Evidence
Act, and holds that the official answer key to be correct.

be direct which is stipulated in Section 60 of the Act has numerous exceptions laid down in the Act.
However, the question posed, relates to the definition of "Evidence" in Section 3 of the Act and an
oral testimony of a witness in Court is oral evidence.
The objectors have misconstrued the frame of the question and by convoluted reasoning are vying
for the wrong option.
The panel has gone through the judgment in 19 of 51 Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:080579-DB
2023:PHHC:080579-DB CWP Nos.11695 of 2023 (O&M) and connected petitions 20 the case of
Neeraj Dutta (supra) and found it to be not dealing with oral evidence or as to what the oral
testimony of a witness is described/called. It, in the fact situation obtainable therein, held that the
passing of money should be proved by direct evidence. It was rendered under the Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1988.
The other judgments, as noticed above, relied upon by the objectors are on a different point. In both
the judgments, the Court reiterated the rule laid down in Section 60 of the Act.
Same is the case in State of Jharkhand versus Shailendra Kumar Rai @ Pandev Raisupra) as it
nowhere mentions that the testimony of a witness to the existence or non-
existence of the fact or the facts in issue is "direct evidence". It refers to direct evidence in para 37
while referring to Section 32 of the Evidence Act, 1872. It also refers to oral evidence in para 34 and
35 of the judgment emphasizing that the oral evidence must be direct.
So far as the authority Chauna Orang versus The State of Assam (supra) is concerned, the same
mentions at one place only i.e. in para no.1 that the direct evidence is the testimony of a witness to
the existence or non-
existence of the fact or the facts in issue, but does not define the same to the exclusion of Section 60
of the Evidence Act, 1872.
Primarily, it was in comparison to the circumstantial evidence which this judgment has been
discussing so as to decide the particular matter in question.
Thus, the Panel is of the view that the official answer key is correct.

reasoning of which is stated as below:
Section 151: Indecent and scandalous questions:- The Court may forbid any questions or inquiries
which it regards as indecent or scandalous, although such questions or inquiries may have some
bearing on the questions before the court, unless they relate to facts in issue, or to matters necessary

Section 43 of Transfer of Property Act, 1882 has embodied the general principle of estoppel. The law
incorporated in Section 43 is based upon common law doctrine of estoppel by deed. The equity does
not permit him to deny his earlier statement thus the transferor will not be allowed to deny the false
representations made by him earlier which was acted upon by the transferee i.e. the transferor will
not be allowed to blow hot and cold in the same breath.
The doctrine of election is stated in Section 35 of the Transfer of Property Act. Election means the
choice between 2 alternatives or conflicting rights. The recipient must choose between two
inconsistencies or alternative rights. This doctrine is also based on the principle of estoppel in the
sense that it prevents a person from taking 2 inconsistent positions in the property dispute. His
earlier choice constitutes an election and he is estopped from making a contradictory claim.

CWP No. 11312 of 2023.
The Petitioner submits that Question No.85 & 88 are contrary to each other if the answer to
question 85 is believed to be option A, as reflected in the answer key, it would mean that in lease of
an immovable property only right to enjoy the property is transferred and in lease of an immovable
property no interest is created in the property. Further, if the answer to Question 88 is believed to
the option C, as reflected in the answer key, it would mean that no interest is created in the property

deleted. Reliance being placed on Easement Act, 1882 is misplaced as the statute is territorially
limited in its application and Section 52 of the Act itself specifies that the right transferred in license
does not amount to an interest in the property.
It, thus, reinforces the point that license does not involve transfer of an interest in the immovable
property.
Thus, the panel is of the view that the official answer key is correct.

12. The matter was then considered by the learned Recruitment Committee in its meeting held on
13.02.2023. After consideration of recommendations as submitted by the Expert Panel, it was
resolved that questions appearing at serial numbers 5, 6, 64 and 103 in the Copy of Question Paper
Code 'A' be deleted with the consequence that no credit or discredit in respect of these questions be
given irrespective of the fact whether these questions have been attempted by the candidates or not.
In respect to question no. 35, it was resolved that no change is required for the proposed answer key
and in respect to question no. 1, the Committee found anomaly in the proposed answer key,
therefore recommended the change of answer from option D to option C. It was directed that
proposed changes in the answer key of the preliminary examination held on 22.01.2023 be uploaded
of the official website of this Court with the stipulation that any candidate may file online
cross-objections on the "Cross-Objection Portal"
of the official website of this High Court while affording two days time and that
cross-objections, if so received, should be put up before the Committee.
13. As many as 35 cross-objections were received against the proposed change in respect to question
no.1 in the answer key. The matter was reconsidered by the learned Committee and it was resolved
on 41 of 51 Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:080579-DB 2023:PHHC:080579-DB CWP Nos.11695
of 2023 (O&M) and connected petitions 42 21.02.2023 that question no.1 also should be deleted
being ambiguous.
Certain cross-objections received through e-mail qua deletion of two questions, were also
considered, but finding no substance therein said cross-
objections were rejected. Answer key was directed to be finalized and result prepared through the
service provider. Final answer key was uploaded on 21.02.2023.
14. Learned counsel for the petitioners in different writ petitions submitted that taking preliminary
examination admittedly does not vest any candidate with the right of selection and that the only
right which would accrue to the candidates would be to make him/her eligible to take the main
examination i.e., the next step for selection and while stating that being fully conscious of the settled
position that an Expert opinion should not ordinarily be tinkered with, they vehemently argued that
as the Court is not alien to the subject to law, therefore the abovesaid may not apply stricto sensu.
Vehement arguments have been raised by learned counsel for the petitioners in respect to all the
questions while submitting qua some of the questions, that deletion thereof is not made out at all
and furthermore in respect to some of the questions, two or more options are correct, therefore said
questions should have been deleted.
15. In respect to deletion of question no.1, it has been categorically argued that once the Expert
Panel had recommended change of the final answer key from option D to C, deletion of the said
question was not called for. It was argued that incorrect change in the answer key has caused
manifest injustice to the petitioners, some of whom have obtained such marks that if they had the
benefit of questions deleted (which are stated to have been correctly answered), they would be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56624229/ 41Navdeep Kaur vs State Of Punjab And Others on 1 June, 2023
eligible to take the main examination. With the deletion of some of the questions, some of the 42 of

(O&M) and connected petitions 43 petitioners, it is submitted, have been put to specific
disadvantage. Apart from reiterating the objections as raised by the petitioners qua the answer key
to fifteen questions as dealt with by the Expert Committee, certain additional arguments were also
raised qua some of the questions by learned counsel.
16. Learned counsel for the petitioners have urged that in the given facts and circumstances, where
glaring discrepancies are apparent on the face of it, interference by this Court is called for and
another Expert Committee comprising of retired High Court Judges should be constituted to look
into the matter and in the meanwhile, petitioners should be permitted to take the main examination
provisionally subject to decision of the said Expert Committee.
17. We also take note of the additional argument raised on behalf of the petitioner in CWP No.11695
of 2023 to the extent that no marks have been awarded to her for her answer to question no.101 of
Set B i.e., Question No.10 of Set A. It is her case that she had blackened option D as answer to
question no.101 which is the correct answer as per the answer key.
She was not awarded any marks for the same. As per information received by her, there was
overwriting on her OMR Sheet at option A also, due to which no marks were granted for this answer.
Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that it is only a few dots which are visible under option A
to question no.1 and the complete option D has been blackened by the petitioner, therefore she
should be awarded marks for the same.
18. Original OMR Sheet of the said petition was produced before us and we found that option D of
question no.101 was completely blackened and option A was partially blackened by the petitioner,
inasmuch as the complete centre portion of option A was blackened and it is not a case of 43 of 51

(O&M) and connected petitions 44 few dots appearing at option A.
19. Learned counsel for the said petition on examining the original OMR Sheet himself is unable to
deny that in terms of instruction no. 2 contained in the OMR sheet itself, she is not entitled to any
marks for the same.
20. Learned counsel for all the petitioners, while reiterating that opinion of the Expert Panel and
learned Recruitment Committee is required to be revisited, prayed that all these writ petitions
should be allowed.
21. Learned counsel for respondent no.3 while refuting the arguments raised on behalf of the
petitioners submitted that process of selection is being carried with strict adherence to the
provisions of law and that there is no ground whatsoever which calls for setting aside of the answer
key released on 21.02.2023. It is submitted that an Expert Panel was duly constituted and thereafter
the matter considered by the learned Recruitment Committee itself and necessary action taken. It is
thus prayed that all these writ petitions be dismissed.

22. We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and have gone through the file and
record as produced before us with their able assistance.
23. It is to be noted at the outset that written statement has been filed in some of the writ petitions
i.e., CWP Nos.4630, 6497, 4697, 4890, 5308, 5323, 6593, 6684, 7983, 8366, 9028, 9803, 10483,
9256, 8614 and 5971 of 2023. Learned counsel for the parties had agreed that it was not necessary
for individual written statements to be filed in all the writ petitions. CWP Nos.11237, 11312, 11926
and 11695 of 2023, in which notice of motion was not formally issued as yet were also taken up for
hearing at request of learned counsel with the requisite information being 44 of 51 Neutral Citation

connected petitions 45 made available by learned counsel for respondent no.3.
24. It is a settled position of law that judicial restraint is always to be exercised qua interference with
answer keys provided by Expert Committees in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kanpur University, through Vice Chancellor
and others Vs. Samir Gupta and others, 1983(4) SCC 309, has observed as under:-
"16....... We agree that the key-answer should be assumed to be correct unless it is
proved to be wrong and that it should not be held to be wrong by an inferential
process of reasoning or by a process of rationalisation. It must be clearly
demonstrated to be wrong, that is to say, it must be such as no reasonable body of
men well-versed in the particular subject would regard as correct........."
25. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Ran Vijay Singh and others Vs. State of U.P and others
(2018) 2 SCC 357, while dealing with the question of revaluation or scrutiny of answer sheets held as
under:-
"30. The law on the subject is therefore, quite clear and we only propose to highlight
a few significant conclusions. They are:
(i) If a statute, Rule or Regulation governing an examination permits the
re-evaluation of an answer sheet or scrutiny of an answer sheet as a matter of right,
then the authority conducting the examination may permit it;
(ii) If a statute, Rule or Regulation governing an examination does not permit
re-evaluation or scrutiny of an answer sheet (as distinct from prohibiting it) then the
Court may permit re-
evaluation or scrutiny only if it is demonstrated very clearly, without any "inferential process of
reasoning or by a process of rationalisation" and only in rare or exceptional cases that a material
error has been committed;
(iii) The Court should not at all re-evaluate or scrutinize the answer sheets of a candidate - it has no
Expertise in the matter and academic matters are best left to academics;

(iv) The Court should presume the correctness of the key answers and proceed on that assumption;
and
(v) In the event of a doubt, the benefit should go to the examination authority rather than to the
candidate."
xx xx xx xx
31. On our part we may add that sympathy or compassion does not play any role in the matter of
directing or not directing re-evaluation of an answer sheet. If an error is committed by the
examination authority, the complete body of candidates suffers. The entire examination process
does not deserve to be derailed only because some candidates are disappointed or dissatisfied or
perceive some injustice having been caused to them by an erroneous question or an erroneous
answer. All candidates suffer equally, though some might suffer more but that cannot be helped
since mathematical precision is not always possible. This Court has shown one way out of an
impasse - exclude the suspect or offending question.
32. It is rather unfortunate that despite several decisions of this Court, some of which have been
discussed above, there is interference by the Courts in the result of examinations. This places the
examination authorities in an unenviable position where they are under scrutiny and not the
candidates. Additionally, a massive and sometimes prolonged examination exercise concludes with
an air of uncertainty. While there is no doubt that candidates put in a tremendous effort in
preparing for an examination, it must not be forgotten that even the examination authorities put in
equally great efforts to successfully conduct an examination. The enormity of the task might reveal
some lapse at a later stage, but the Court must consider the internal checks and balances put in
place by the examination authorities before interfering with the efforts put in by the candidates who
have successfully participated in the examination and the examination authorities. The present
appeals are a classic 46 of 51 Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:080579-DB
2023:PHHC:080579-DB CWP Nos.11695 of 2023 (O&M) and connected petitions 47 example of the
consequence of such interference where there is no finality to the result of the examinations even
after a lapse of eight years. Apart from the examination authorities even the candidates are left
wondering about the certainty or otherwise of the result of the examination
- whether they have passed or not; whether their result will be approved or disapproved by the
Court; whether they will get admission in a college or University or not; and whether they will get
recruited or not. This unsatisfactory situation does not work to anybody's advantage and such a state
of uncertainty results in confusion being worse confounded. The overall and larger impact of all this
is that public interest suffers."
26. Insofar as the argument that this Court not being an alien to the subject of law, should examine
the objections raised as in appeal, is devoid of any merit, hence rejected. In this respect gainful
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56624229/ 44Navdeep Kaur vs State Of Punjab And Others on 1 June, 2023
reference can be made to a Division Bench Judgment of this High Court in CWP No. 698 of 2022,
decided on 14.01.2022, titled as Penaaz Dhillon Vs. State of Haryana and others, wherein challenge
was to the result of preliminary examination of the HCS (Judicial Branch) Examination 2020-21 for
the post of Civil Judge (Jr. Division). Challenge had been raised to the answer key in the said case.
While referring to judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in H.P. Public Service Commission Vs.
Mukesh Thakur and others, 2010 (6) SCC 759, it was held that merely because the subject happens
to be law, the Court would not arrogate to itself the powers of the Expert Committee.
27. The Hon'ble Supreme Court while reiterating and reaffirming its earlier decisions, held as under
in U.P.P.S.C and others Vs. Rahul Singh and others, 2018 AIR (Supreme Court) 2861:-
"12. The law is well settled that the onus is on the candidate to not only demonstrate
that the key answer is incorrect but also 47 of 51 Neutral Citation
No:=2023:PHHC:080579-DB 2023:PHHC:080579-DB CWP Nos.11695 of 2023
(O&M) and connected petitions 48 that it is a glaring mistake which is totally
apparent and no inferential process or reasoning is required to show that the key
answer is wrong. The Constitutional Courts must exercise great restraint in such
matters and should be reluctant to entertain a plea challenging the correctness of the
key answers."
28. Details of objections raised by the petitioners, their consideration by the Expert Panel and their
evaluation by the learned Recruitment Committee has been reproduced in the foregoing paras. We
have also gone through the Original Report of the Expert Panel produced before us. Learned counsel
for the petitioners had referred to the judgments, which have admittedly been considered by the
Expert Panel as well as the learned Recruitment Committee. Having considered the
recommendation of the Expert Committee as further considered, deliberated and decided by the
learned Recruitment Committee, details of which as supplied to us and as have been reproduced in
the foregoing paras, we find no glaring mistake or opinion which is unreasonable, calling for
interference in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. In the given
factual matrix, we do not consider it necessary or appropriate to render a further detailed discussion
on each and every individual question.
29. We do not find any such glaring discrepancy in the matter which calls for the matter being
referred to another Expert Committee.
Routine constitution of such Expert Committee/s has been deprecated by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in Haryana Public Service Commission Vs. State of Haryana and others, Civil Appeal No. 7727
of 2019 (arising out of SLP (C) No. 30800 of 2018). In the said case, Haryana Public Service
Commission, had undertaken the selection process to appoint 133 Assistant Professors of Geography
(College), for which an objective type question 48 of 51 Neutral Citation

connected petitions 49 paper was set up wherein candidates were required to answer 100 questions.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/56624229/ 45Navdeep Kaur vs State Of Punjab And Others on 1 June, 2023
It was contended before the learned Single Judge that out of 100 questions, most of them are either
ambiguous or without correct answer key. Expert Committee was constituted, which on going
through the question paper in detail gave its opinion regarding seven questions. Learned Single
Judge on going through the question paper concluded that four more questions were ambiguous,
therefore should be deleted from consideration. Division Bench in appeal against the decision of the
learned Single Judge, while holding that it was not for the learned Single Judge to carry out the
exercise of an expert, passed orders for appointing another Expert Committee, which was subject
matter of challenge before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Haryana Public Service Commission's case
(Supra). The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that if judgment of Division Bench is allowed to stand,
there would be no finality to the selection process and especially keeping in view the fact that there
was no allegation as such against the Expert Committee, who in its wisdom had submitted its report.
30. We must note at this stage that much stress had been laid on the fact that deletion of question
no.1 is unfair on the premise that the Expert Panel had recommended change of answer to question
no.1 from option D to C and the same was accepted by the learned Recruitment Committee at the
first instance on 13.02.2023. Therefore, deletion of question no.1 was incorrectly directed by the
learned Recruitment Committee at a subsequent stage, working to the detriment of a number of
candidates, who would otherwise have been eligible to take the Mains examination, having
answered the said question correctly. However, we find no merit in this argument in view of the
discussion in the foregoing paras. We further reiterate that having perused meeting note dated
17.02.2023 of the learned 49 of 51 Neutral Citation No:=2023:PHHC:080579-DB
2023:PHHC:080579-DB CWP Nos.11695 of 2023 (O&M) and connected petitions 50 Recruitment
Committee we find that decision to delete Question no.1 was a well deliberated process after taking
note of 35 cross-objections which were received against the proposed answer key to question no.1. It
is reiterated that we have deliberately not entered the realm of discussion on the individual
questions as in terms of the arguments as raised before us for the reason that we do not find the
opinion and the recommendation of the Expert Panel and the decision taken by the learned
Recruitment Committee to be discrepant or unreasonable which calls for any interference. As has
been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Ran Vijay Singh (Supra), in the event of doubt,
benefit necessarily has to be given to the examination authority rather than the candidate and
exclusion of an offending question has been found to be correct way out.
31. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in High Court of Tripura through Registrar General Vs. Tirtha
Sarathi Mukherjee and others, 2019 (2) SCT 117, held that the right to seek a writ of mandamus is
based on the existence of a legal right and corresponding duty with the answering respondent to
carry out public duty. In the absence of any provision, the writ Court, it is held would exercise its
powers only in a situation which is rare and exceptional. No such exceptional circumstance has been
pointed out in these writ petitions.
32. It is pertinent to note that there is no allegation whatsoever against the Expert Panel or the
learned Recruitment Committee. In-fact, learned counsel for the petitioners have been at pains to
express that there is categorically no allegation or any mala fide alleged either against the Expert
Panel or learned Recruitment Committee and that they would point out only the discrepancies on
the basis of which they seek relief.

petitioners are unable to point out any such glaring discrepancy(ies) which call for interference by
this Court in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
34. Learned counsel for the petitioners has also been unable to point out any illegality or irregularity
to indicate that the process and procedure followed was not justified or was unfair in any manner.
35. It is necessary to note at this juncture that some miscellaneous applications have been filed by
some unsuccessful candidates seeking intervention on the ground that they are similarly situated as
the petitioners in the said writ petitions. Hearing was afforded to learned counsel for said applicants
as well.
36. Keeping in view the facts and circumstances as above, we do not find any ground whatsoever
which calls for interference by this Court in the present writ petitions.
37. No other argument has been raised.
38. All the writ petitions are accordingly dismissed with no order as to costs. Pending applications
are also disposed of accordingly.
