Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153664247/ 7Indian Oil Corporation ... vs M/S. Shree Ganesh Petroleum ... on 1 February, 2022
the happening of any of the following events namely:-
a) If the Dealer shall commit a breach or

covenants and stipulations contained in this Agreement,… …
61.(a) Any dispute or difference of any nature whatsoever, any claim, cross-claim, counter-claim or

hereto arising out of or in relation to this agreement shall be referred to the sole arbitration of the
Director (Marketing) of the Corporation who may either himself act as the Arbitrator or nominate
some other officer of the Corporation to act as the Arbitrator. The Dealer will not be entitled to raise
any objection to any such Arbitrator on the ground that the Arbitrator is an Officer of the
Corporation.”
9. There can be no dispute that the Lease Agreement and Dealership Agreement are distinct
agreements independent of each other. This is evident from the terms and conditions of the
respective agreements. While the lease agreement was for a fixed period of 29 years from 15th April
2005, after which the lease could be extended by mutual agreement on mutually agreed terms and
conditions, the dealership agreement was for a period of 15 years from 15 th November 2006 and to
continue thereafter for successive periods of one year each, until determined by the other party.
10. Furthermore, the lease agreement specifically authorized the Appellant to sublet, underlet,
assign or transfer possession of the said premises to any person. The lease agreement also reserved
on the Appellant the right to appoint, remove, reappoint, change or substitute any dealers, agents,
licensees or other authorized representatives of the Appellant on and in respect of the said premises,
without the consent of the lessor, that is, the Respondent.
11. The dealership agreement was inherently terminable whereas the lease agreement as stated
above was for a fixed period of 29 years from the date of execution thereof. Clause 3(b) of the lease
agreement specifically provided that, on the lessee paying the rent as per the lease agreement and
performing its conditions, it would be entitled to peaceably hold and enjoy the said premises
without any interruption by the lessor/s or any person claiming through the lessor/s.
12. Distinctness of the dealership agreement from the lease agreement is also apparent from the
obligation imposed by the dealership agreement on the Respondent to pay a licence fee for use of
the said premises demised by the Respondent to the Appellant.
13. While the lease agreement provided for reference of disputes to the Managing Director of the
Appellant for arbitration and if the Managing Director was unable or unwilling to act as a sole
Arbitrator, then the sole arbitration of any other person designated or nominated by the Managing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153664247/ 8Indian Oil Corporation ... vs M/S. Shree Ganesh Petroleum ... on 1 February, 2022
Director, the dealership agreement provided for reference of disputes to the sole arbitration of the
Director (Marketing) of the Corporation who might either himself act as the Arbitrator or nominate
some other officer of the Corporation to act as the Arbitrator.
14. The lease agreement expressly provided that disputes under the said agreement were not to be
referred to any person other than the Managing Director of the Appellant, and if for any reason that
was not possible, the matter was not to be referred to arbitration at all. On the other hand, as stated
above, disputes under the dealership agreement were referable to the Director (Marketing) of the
Appellant who was debarred from entertaining any reference of dispute under the lease agreement.
15. The learned Additional Solicitor General, Ms. Madhavi Diwan, appearing on behalf of the
Appellant referred to a judgment of this Court in Rahul Yadav and Another v. Indian Oil
Corporation Limited and others1, where this Court clearly held that a dealership agreement by
which the lessor of a land was appointed a dealer was distinct and independent from the lease
agreement by which the land on which the outlet was installed, had been demised to the Appellant.
16. In Rahul Yadav v. Indian Oil Corporation (supra), this Court held:-
“18. We have referred to the clauses in extenso to highlight that the lessee had
entered into an agreement of lease with the appellant with immense liberty and the
lease deed does lay down that the lessee has the freedom to sublet and appoint
another dealer. The lease would remain in force till the dealership of the appellant
continued and the licence remained in vogue. At this juncture, it is pertinent to
reproduce certain clauses of the dealership agreement which would clearly spell out
the purpose. They read as follows:
“2. The Corporation do hereby grant to the Dealer leave and licence and permission
for the duration of this Agreement to enter on the said premises and to use the
premises and outfit for the sole and exclusive purpose of storing, selling and handling
the products purchased by the Dealer from the Corporation, save as aforesaid, the
Dealer shall have no right, title or interest in the said premises or outfit and shall not
be entitled to claim 1 (2015) 9 SCC 447 the right of lessee, sub-lessee, tenant or any
other interest in the premises or outfit, is being specifically agreed and declared in
particular that the Dealer shall not be deemed to be in exclusive possession of the
premises.
3. This Agreement shall remain in force for five years from 14th day of May, 2002 and
continue thereafter for successive periods of one year each until determined by either
party by giving three months' notice in writing to the other of its intention to
terminate this Agreement, and upon the expiration of any such notice this Agreement
and the licence granted as aforesaid shall stand cancelled and revoked but without
prejudice to the rights of either party against the other in respect of any matter or
thing antecedent to such termination provided that nothing contained in this clause
shall prejudice the rights of the Corporation to terminate this Agreement earlier on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153664247/ 9Indian Oil Corporation ... vs M/S. Shree Ganesh Petroleum ... on 1 February, 2022
the happening of the events mentioned in Clause 56 of this Agreement.
***
7. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to prohibit the Corporation from making
direct and/or indirect sales to any person whomsoever or from appointing other dealers for the
purpose of direct or indirect sales at such places as the Corporation may think fit. The dealer shall
not be entitled to any claim or allowance for such direct or indirect sales.”
19. It is appropriate to mention here that Clause 56 of the said agreement stipulates that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary containing before the said clause, the Corporation would
be at liberty to terminate the agreement forthwith upon any time after happening of certain events.
The conditions are manifold. We may, for the sake of completeness, reproduce two conditions:
“(h) If the Dealer does not adhere to the instructions issued from time to time by the Corporation in
connection with safe practices to be followed by him in the supply/storage of the Corporation's
products or otherwise.
(i) If the Dealer shall deliberately contaminate or temper with the quality of any of the Corporation's
products.”
20. On a plain reading of the aforesaid agreement, it is clear as noon day that it has no connection
whatsoever with the lease agreement. Both the agreements are independent of each other. The
appellant was a dealer under the lessee, that is, the Corporation. The dealership is liable to be
cancelled on many a ground. In case there is a termination, dealership is bound to be cancelled and
at that juncture, if the lease deed is treated to have been terminated along with the dealership, it will
lead to a situation which does not flow from the interpretation of the instruments. The dealership
agreement has been terminated because of the decision rendered by this Court in Mukund Swarup
Mishra [(2007) 2 SCC 536]. The consequence of cancellation of the dealership is a sequitur of the
judgment. The inevitable consequence of that is that the appellant has to vacate the premises and
the Corporation has the liberty to operate either independently or through another dealer. The
appellant cannot be allowed to cause obstruction or create an impediment. The submission that the
appellant entered into the lease agreement at a monthly rent of Rs 10,000 as it was given the
dealership is a mercurial plea, only to be noted to be rejected. The dealership was availed of as has
been held by this Court in an inapposite manner. In such a situation, consequences are to be faced
by the appellant.”
17. It appears that during a routine inspection on 17 th April 2008 certain irregularities were noticed
with regard to functioning of the retail outlet of which the Respondent had been appointed dealer.
18. By a letter dated 17th April 2008, the Appellant directed the Respondent not to carry on further
sales from the said outlet.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153664247/ 10Indian Oil Corporation ... vs M/S. Shree Ganesh Petroleum ... on 1 February, 2022
Thereafter, a notice dated 18th April 2008 was issued to the Respondent calling upon the
Respondent to show cause why action should not be taken against the Respondent for irregularities
which amounted to violation of the Marketing Discipline Guidelines (MDG) 2005 issued by the
Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Government of India and Public Sector Oil Marketing
Companies.
19. The Appellant also suspended the sale and supplies to the retail outlet run by the Respondent. By
a letter dated 21 st April 2008, the Respondent replied to the show cause notice admitting the
irregularities alleged.
20. By a letter dated 20th August 2008, the Appellant terminated the dealership of the Respondent,
called upon the Respondent to vacate the retail outlet and hand over peaceful possession thereof to
the Appellant and also to settle accounts with the Appellant.
21. The Respondent appealed to the Appellate Authority of the Appellant against the order of
termination dated 20 th August 2008. By an order dated 17th July 2009, the Appellate Authority of
the Appellant dismissed the appeal of the Respondent.
22. By a letter dated 24th August 2009, the Respondent invoked the arbitration clause in the
dealership agreement and requested the Director (Marketing) of the Appellant to appoint an
Arbitrator.
23. The Director (Marketing) of the Appellant appointed Mr. B.L Parihar as Arbitrator in terms of
the dealership agreement, by an order dated 9th November 2009.
24. The Respondent filed its Statement of Claims before the learned Arbitrator challenging the order
of termination of the dealership agreement. In addition to the prayer for setting aside of the order of
termination of the dealership agreement and the prayer for damages, the Respondent made an
alternative prayer for amendment of the lease agreement to enhance the monthly rent of the said
premises to Rs.35,000/- with a 20% increase after every three years.
25. The Appellant filed its Written Statement to the Statement of Claim. In its Written Statement,
the Appellant contended: -
“2. The Claimant alternatively claimed a sum of Rs.45,28,000/- with interest at the
rate of Rs.15% per annum and further claimed increase in lease rent to Rs.35,000/-
per month with 20% increase after every three years. The said alternative prayers of
the Claimant are outside the ambit of this arbitration proceedings and hence not
maintainable and are liable to be rejected.
xxx xxx xxx
9. … The rent was fixed after the Claimant had negotiated with the Committee of
Officials of the Respondent and had agreed to the amount of rent. As such the Rent
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153664247/ 11Indian Oil Corporation ... vs M/S. Shree Ganesh Petroleum ... on 1 February, 2022
was fixed mutually between the parties. The Respondent further submits that the
Claimant has been regularly accepting the monthly rent of Rs.1750/- from 2005 till
date and has never raised any objection to the amount of the said Rent till filing of
this Statement of Claim. As such the Claimant has raised this issue of monthly rent as
purely an afterthought in this Statement of Claim.” xxx xxx xxx
29. The alternative prayers of the Claimant at para 34(b)(I)(II) are not within the
ambit of the Arbitration proceedings and hence not maintainable and not admitted
by the Respondent. The Claimant has no ground whatsoever to call upon the
Arbitrator to Order the Respondent to pay to the Claimant the sum of Rs.45,28,000/-
with interest at the rate of 15% per annum from the date of filing the claim till the
payment by the Claimant. Without challenging the registered Lease Deed executed by
the Claimant the Claimant cannot seek Order of the Hon’ble Arbitrator to modify the
terms of the Lease Deed. Therefore the alternative prayers of the Claimant are also be
liable to be rejected in toto.
26. The main issues which arose for determination before the learned Arbitrator were:-
“….
3. Whether the Claimant committed breaches of MDG Guideline and Dealership
Agreement dated 15.11.2006 and whether the claimant is entitled for restoration?
4. Whether the Termination letter dated 20.08.2009 is legal, valid and subsisting?
5. Whether the Claimant proves that the Claimant is entitled for Order/Decree against the
Respondent for the sum of Rs.45,28,000/-?
6. Whether this Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction to increase monthly Lease Rent from Rs.1750/-
per month to Rs.35,000/- per month with 20% increase after every three years?
7. Whether the Claimant proves that the Claimant is entitled for increase in monthly lease rent from
Rs.1,750/- per month to Rs.35,000/- per month with 20% increase after every three years?”
27. The learned Arbitrator made and published an award dated 04.11.2010 holding :-
…I hold that the Claimant has committed the breaches of terms and conditions of the
Dealership Agreement dated 15.11.2006 and MDG 2001 and therefore Termination
Letter dated 20.08.2008 issued by the Respondent is legal & valid. I therefore find
that the Claimant therefore is not entitled for any restoration.
FINDINGS AS TO ISSUE NO.5 I find that the Claimant has made investment of
Rs.45,28,000/- whereas the Respondent has also made investment of
Rs.57,00,000/- for construction of Retail Outlet and allied expenditures. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153664247/ 12Indian Oil Corporation ... vs M/S. Shree Ganesh Petroleum ... on 1 February, 2022
Claimant has committed the serious irregularities which are not at all permitted as
per the said Dealership agreement & MDG and provision penalties are also made
thereof, which has caused the serious loss of goodwill and reputation to the
Respondent Company. Due to the serious irregularities, the Claimant’s dealership
was terminated. The Claimant therefore is not entitled for sum of Rs.45,28,000/- and
interest thereon.
The Claimant had raised an Appeal before Executive Director (Retail Sales) of the
Respondent to revoke the termination of Dealership on humanitarian ground since
lease rent of the land is too low to survive. The Claimant submitted that the Claimant
offered and agreed to let out his Land on Long Lease for monthly rent of Rs.1,750/-
only because the Respondent agreed to allot the dealership of petrol pump as his plot
of land and the monthly income from the said dealership was assured.
I have perused the Government Valuation Report of the Land of the Claimant (Exhibit “O”) and
instance of one Mr. Bajirao Jadhav relied upon the Claimant (Exhibit “P”) to prove the market rate
of the vicinity of the Land of the Claimant. Both the documents are registered documents. The Lease
Agreements executed by Mr. Bajirao Jadhav and the Claimant are altogether different with different
terms and conditions and negotiations between the parties. The Claimant and Respondent are
bound by terms and conditions of Lease Agreement dated 20.09.2005 and this Arbitral Tribunal
cannot go beyond the Lease Agreement dated 20.09.2005 have provided and determined the rates
of rent and increases in the rent and the same are binding upon the parties. I find that since the
Dealership of petrol pump is already terminated there shall be no income of the dealership to the
claimant other than the lease rent which is too low to survive and claimant had agreed to let out his
Land on Long Lease for monthly rent of Rs.1,750/- only because the Respondent agreed to allot the
dealership of petrol pump as his plot of land therefore the Claimant is entitled to get some
reasonable increase in the monthly lease rent of the said land for survival but increase not to the
tune of Rs.35000/- from Rs.1750/- as submitted by the Claimant.
Award
1. The Termination of dealership order dated 20.08.2008 is valid, legal and binding upon the
Claimant and the Respondent. The Claimant is not entitled for restoration of dealership.
2. The claimant is not entitled, for claim of Rs.45,28,000/- and interest thereon.
3. The monthly lease rent of the said land to be increased from Rs.1750/- to Rs.10000/- with 10%
increase after every three years w.e.f. the date of the termination of the dealership and period of
lease deed to be kept as per period mentioned in the advertisement published in the News Paper on
6.7.2005. With the above award, I have concluded the arbitration proceedings and published this
award on 4.11.2010.”
28. The Appellant filed an application being Civil Misc. Application No. 115 of 2011 under Section 34
of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, hereinafter referred to as “the 1996 Act” for setting
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153664247/ 13Indian Oil Corporation ... vs M/S. Shree Ganesh Petroleum ... on 1 February, 2022
aside of the said award in the Court of the District Judge, Pune. The Respondent filed its cross
objection to the impugned award and also filed a counter claim in the Court of the District Judge,
Pune.
29. The counter claim filed by the Respondent was apparently misconceived. There could be no
question of any counter claim to an application for setting aside of an award.
30. Section 5 of the 1996 Act provides that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for
the time being in force, in matters governed by Part I of the 1996 Act, no judicial authority shall
intervene except where so provided in Part I.
31. Section 34 in Part I of the 1996 Act as it is stood at the material time provided as follows:
"34. Application for setting aside arbitral award.—(1) Recourse to a Court against an
arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in
accordance with sub-section (2) and sub-section (3).
(2) An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court only if—
(a) the party making the application furnishes proof that
(i) a party was under some incapacity; or
(ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or,
failing any indication thereon, under the law for the time being in force; or
(iii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an
arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or
(iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the
submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to
arbitration:
Provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not
so submitted, only that part of the arbitral award which contains decisions on matters not submitted
to arbitration may be set aside; or
(v) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the
agreement of the parties, unless such agreement was in conflict with a provision of this Part from
which the parties cannot derogate, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with this Part;
or
(b) the Court finds that—
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153664247/ 14Indian Oil Corporation ... vs M/S. Shree Ganesh Petroleum ... on 1 February, 2022
(i) the subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law for the
time being in force, or
(ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of India.
[Explanation 1.—For the avoidance of any doubt, it is clarified that an award is in conflict with the
public policy of India, only if,—
(i) the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in violation of
Section 75 or Section 81; or
(ii) it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law; or
(iii) it is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice.
Explanation 2.—For the avoidance of doubt, the test as to whether there is a contravention with the
fundamental policy of Indian law shall not entail a review on the merits of the dispute.] [(2-A) An
arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than international commercial arbitrations, may also
be set aside by the Court, if the court finds that the award is vitiated by patent illegality appearing on
the face of the award:
Provided that an award shall not be set aside merely on the ground of an erroneous application of
the law or by reappreciation of evidence.]”
32. As observed above, the lease agreement and the dealership agreement are distinct agreements,
independent of each other.
Disputes under the lease agreement were referrable to the arbitration of the Managing Director of
the Appellant who was to be the sole Arbitrator, and only if the Managing Director was unable or
unwilling to act as sole Arbitrator the disputes were to be referred to the sole Arbitrator designated
or nominated by the Managing Director in his place. If the disputes could not be referred to the
Managing Director for any reason, the matter was not to be referred to arbitration at all.
33. In the instant case, the Respondent invoked the Arbitration Clause under the Dealership
Agreement and approached the Director (Marketing) of the Appellant who appointed Mr. B.L.
Parihar as the sole Arbitrator. The Arbitrator, Mr. B.L. Parihar, nominated by the Director
(Marketing) of the Appellant had no authority and/or jurisdiction to adjudicate any dispute
pertaining to the lease agreement.
34. The Arbitral Award is liable to be set aside in so far as the same deals with disputes with regard
to the Lease Agreement which are not contemplated by the Arbitration Clause in the dealership
agreement and/or in other words, do not fall within the terms of the submission to Arbitration. The
Arbitral award is thus liable to be set aside under Section 34(2)(a)(iv) of the 1996 Act. The decision
enhancing the lease rent is patently beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153664247/ 15Indian Oil Corporation ... vs M/S. Shree Ganesh Petroleum ... on 1 February, 2022
Moreover, the composition of the Arbitral Tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance
with the lease agreement dated 20 th September, 2005.
35. By a judgment and order dated 29 th January 2013, the District Judge-3, Pune allowed the
Counter Objection of the Respondent to the award in part and modified the award by deleting the
last clause, that is, “and the period of Lease Deed to be kept as per the period mentioned in the
advertisement published in the newspapers on 6.7.2005” with the observation that the term of
agreement if wholly prejudicial or capable of causing grave injustice to one of the parties, could
certainly be overlooked not only by Court of Justice, but also by the Arbitrator. The District Judge
held that the learned Arbitrator had rightly enhanced the rent to Rs. 10,000/- with 10% increase
after every three years. However, the learned Court held that it was not within the province of the
Arbitrator to decrease the lease period to 19 years and 11 months as per the advertisement given in
the newspapers.
36. Both the Respondent and Appellant appealed to the Bombay High Court under Section 37 of the
1996 Act challenging the judgment and order of the District Judge-3, Pune.
37. By a judgment and order dated 11 th September 2015, the High Court partly allowed the
Arbitration Appeal No.19 of 2013 filed by the Respondent and dismissed Arbitration Appeal No.39
of 2013 filed by the Appellant observing that there was no scope for the District Court to interfere
with the impugned award. The High Court held:-
“10. Coming to the interference by the appellate court with the award on the dispute
under the lease agreement, it is patent from the impugned order that the interference
with the same was beyond the provision of Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. The
learned Judge on the one hand permitted enhancement of the lease rent but denied
the reduction of the lease period. The learned Judge lost sight of the fact that the
claimant had contended before the learned Arbitrator that he was compelled by the
respondent to agree for the lease of 29 years and 11 months, though the
advertisement permitted him dealership for only 19 years and 11 months. It is
nobody’s case that the lease rent of Rs.1,750/- per month was at the market rate at
the relevant time. It is obvious that the claimant had agreed for the extended period
of the lease only because the same was coupled with the dealership agreement. In the
circumstances, there was no scope for the District Court to interfere with the
impugned award. To that extent, the appeal of the claimant must be allowed and the
directions contained in the impugned order at paragraph “2” be set aside. Hence,
Arbitration Appeal No.39 of 2013 is dismissed. Arbitration Appeal No.19 of 2013 is
partly allowed. The direction at para 2 of the impugned order is set aside.”
38. In the High Court, learned senior counsel appearing for the Appellant had submitted that
adjudication of the dispute under the lease agreement was beyond the jurisdiction of the learned
Arbitrator.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153664247/ 16Indian Oil Corporation ... vs M/S. Shree Ganesh Petroleum ... on 1 February, 2022
It was pointed out that the lease agreement provided for a specified Arbitrator that is the Managing
Director of the Appellant or any other person designated or nominated by the Managing Director.
The Arbitrator in the instant case, Mr. B.L. Parihar, had been appointed pursuant to the Dealership
Agreement by the Director (Marketing) of the Appellant. The High Court rejected the aforesaid
contention with the observation:-
“9. Perusal of the record however shows that no such contention was taken before the
Arbitrator as also in the application filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.
Therefore, the appellant cannot be allowed to raise it for the first time before this
court. Because it would mean that the claimant has accepted Mr. B.L. Parihar as the
Arbitrator for the dispute under the lease agreement.”
39. In so far as disputes with regard to lease rent and/or any other conditions of the deed of lease
were concerned, the High Court proceeded on the patently erroneous basis that the Appellant had
not objected to the competence or the authority or jurisdiction of the learned Arbitrator to entertain
and decide disputes with regard to lease agreement, ignoring the specific averments made by the
Appellant in its counter statement, which have been extracted hereinabove.
40. In its counter statement, the Appellant had specifically averred that the alternate prayer of the
Respondent claiming increase in lease rent to Rs.35,000/- per month with 20% increase in every
three years was outside the ambit of the arbitration proceedings. The Appellant also asserted
categorically that, without challenging the registered lease deed executed by it, the Respondent
could not seek an order of the Arbitrator, modifying the terms of the lease deed.
41. The High Court also apparently overlooked the fact that the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal
to increase the monthly lease rent from Rs.1750/- per month to Rs.35,000/- per month was
specifically in issue before the learned Arbitrator (Issue No.6) as evident from the impugned award.
42. As held by this Court in Associate Builders v. Delhi Development Authority2, cited by Mr.
Prasenjit Keswani, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondent, Section 34 in
conjunction with Section 5 of the 1996 Act makes it clear that an arbitral award that is governed by
Part I of the 1996 Act, can only be set aside on grounds mentioned under Sections 34(2) and (3) of
the said Act and not otherwise. The Court considering an application for setting aside an award,
under Section 34 of the 1996 Act cannot look 2 (2015) 3 SCC 49 into the merits of the award except
when the award is in conflict with the public policy of India as provided in Section 34(2)(b)(ii) of the
1996 Act.
43. In Associate Builders (supra), this Court held that an award could be said to against the public
policy of India in, inter alia, the following circumstances: -
(i) When an award is, on its face, in patent violation of a statutory provision.
(ii) When the Arbitrator/Arbitral Tribunal has failed to adopt a judicial approach in deciding the
dispute.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153664247/ 17Indian Oil Corporation ... vs M/S. Shree Ganesh Petroleum ... on 1 February, 2022
(iii) When an award is in violation of the principles of natural justice.
(iv) When an award is unreasonable or perverse.
(v) When an award is patently illegal, which would include an award in patent contravention of any
substantive law of India or in patent breach of the 1996 Act.
(vi) When an award is contrary to the interest of India, or against justice or morality, in the sense
that it shocks the conscience of the Court.
44. An Arbitral Tribunal being a creature of contract, is bound to act in terms of the contract under
which it is constituted. An award can be said to be patently illegal where the Arbitral Tribunal has
failed to act in terms of the contract or has ignored the specific terms of a contract.
45. However, a distinction has to be drawn between failure to act in terms of a contract and an
erroneous interpretation of the terms of a contract. An Arbitral Tribunal is entitled to interpret the
terms and conditions of a contract, while adjudicating a dispute. An error in interpretation of a
contract in a case where there is valid and lawful submission of arbitral disputes to an Arbitral
Tribunal is an error within jurisdiction.
46. The Court does not sit in appeal over the award made by an Arbitral Tribunal. The Court does
not ordinarily interfere with interpretation made by the Arbitral Tribunal of a contractual provision,
unless such interpretation is patently unreasonable or perverse.
Where a contractual provision is ambiguous or is capable of being interpreted in more ways than
one, the Court cannot interfere with the arbitral award, only because the Court is of the opinion that
another possible interpretation would have been a better one.
47. In Associate Builders (supra), this Court held that an award ignoring the terms of a contract
would not be in public interest. In the instant case, the award in respect of the lease rent and the
lease term is in patent disregard of the terms and conditions of the lease agreement and thus against
public policy. Furthermore, in Associate Builders (supra) the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal to
adjudicate a dispute itself was not in issue. The Court was dealing with the circumstances in which a
Court could look into the merits of an award.
48. In this case, as observed above, the impugned award insofar as it pertains to lease rent and lease
period is patently beyond the scope of the competence of the Arbitrator appointed in terms of the
dealership agreement by the Director (Marketing) of the Appellant.
49. The lease agreement which was in force for a period of 29 years with effect from 15th April, 2005
specifically provided for monthly lease rent of Rs.1750 per month for the said plot of land on which
the retail outlet had been set up. It is well settled that an Arbitral Tribunal, or for that matter, the
Court cannot alter the terms and conditions of a valid contract executed between the parties with
their eyes open.

50. In Ssangyong Engineering and Construction Company Limited v. National Highways Authority
of India (NHAI) 3, this Court held:
“76. However, when it comes to the public policy of India, argument based upon
“most basic notions of justice”, it is clear that this ground can be attracted only in
very exceptional circumstances when the conscience of the Court is shocked by
infraction of fundamental notions or principles of justice. It can be seen that the
formula that was applied by the agreement continued to be applied till February 2013
— in short, it is not correct to say that the formula under the agreement could not be
applied in view of the Ministry's change in the base indices from 1993-1994 to
2004-2005. Further, in order to apply a linking factor, a Circular, unilaterally issued
by one party, cannot possibly bind the other party to the agreement without that
other party's consent. Indeed, the Circular itself expressly stipulates that it cannot
apply unless the contractors furnish an undertaking/affidavit that the price
adjustment under the Circular is acceptable to them. We have seen how the appellant
gave such undertaking only conditionally and without prejudice to its argument that
the Circular does not and cannot apply. This being the case, it is clear that the
majority award has created a new contract for the parties by applying the said
unilateral Circular and by substituting a workable formula under the agreement by
another formula dehors the agreement. This being the case, a fundamental principle
of justice has been breached, namely, that a unilateral addition or alteration of a
contract can never be foisted upon an unwilling party, nor can a party to the
agreement be liable to perform a bargain not entered into with the other party.
Clearly, such a course of conduct would be contrary to fundamental principles of
justice as followed in this 3 . (2019) 15 SCC 131 country, and shocks the conscience of
this Court. However, we repeat that this ground is available only in very exceptional
circumstances, such as the fact situation in the present case. Under no circumstance
can any court interfere with an arbitral award on the ground that justice has not been
done in the opinion of the Court. That would be an entry into the merits of the
dispute which, as we have seen, is contrary to the ethos of Section 34 of the 1996 Act,
as has been noted earlier in this judgment.”
51. In PSA SICAL Terminals Pvt. Ltd. v. Board of Trustees of V.O. Chidambranar Port Trust
Tuticorin and Others4 this Court referred to and relied upon SSangyong Engineering and
Construction Company Limited (supra) and held:
“87. As such, as held by this Court in Ssangyong Engineering and Construction
Company Limited (supra), the fundamental principle of justice has been breached,
namely, that a unilateral addition or alteration of a contract has been foisted upon an
unwilling party. This Court has further held that a party to the Agreement cannot be
made liable to perform something for which it has not entered into a contract. In our
view, re-writing a contract for the parties would be breach of fundamental principles
of justice entitling a Court to interfere since such case would be one which shocks the
conscience of the Court and as such, would fall in the exceptional category.”
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153664247/ 19Indian Oil Corporation ... vs M/S. Shree Ganesh Petroleum ... on 1 February, 2022
52. In PSA SICAL Terminals Pvt. Ltd. (supra) this Court clearly held that the role of the Arbitrator
was to arbitrate within the terms of the contract. He had no power apart from what the parties had
given him under the contract. If he has travelled beyond the contract, he would be acting without
jurisdiction.
53. In PSA SICAL Terminals Pvt. Ltd. (supra) this Court referred to and relied upon the earlier
judgment of this Court in MD. Army 4 . (2021) SCC Online SC 508 Welfare Housing Organization v.
Sumangal Service (P) Ltd. 5 and held that an Arbitral Tribunal is not a court of law. It cannot
exercise its power ex debito justitiae.
54. In Satyanarayana Construction Company v. Union of India and Others6, a Bench of this Court of
coordinate strength held that once a rate had been fixed in a contract, it was not open to the
Arbitrator to rewrite the terms of the contract and award a higher rate.
Where an Arbitrator had in effect rewritten the contract and awarded a rate, higher than that agreed
in the contract, the High Court was held not to commit any error in setting aside the award.
55. There can be no dispute with the proposition of law enunciated by this Court in Central Inland
Water Transport Corporation Limited and Another v. Brojo Nath Ganguly and Another 7, cited by
Mr. Keswani. The judgment, however, has no application in this case.
56. In Brojo Nath Ganguly (supra), this Court held that a term in a contract of employment as also
service rules of a Government company providing for termination of services of permanent
employees without assigning reasons, on three months’ notice, or pay in lieu thereof was
unconscionable, arbitrary and opposed to public policy. This Court was not concerned with any lease
agreement or any dealership agreement in the aforesaid case.
5 . (2004) 9 SCC 619 6 (2011) 15 SCC 101 7 (1986) 3 SCC 156
57. In this case, there is no finding by the Arbitral Tribunal that any condition of the dealership
agreement was unconscionable and the Arbitral Tribunal has not interfered with termination of the
dealership agreement.
58. The Appellant and the Respondent entered into the lease agreement in this case with their eyes
open. The Respondent had the option not to lease out its property to the Appellant. The situation of
an owner of property, executing a lease agreement in respect of his property cannot be equated with
a contract of employment executed by and between an employee and a mighty employer, where the
employee has little option but to accept the terms and conditions offered by the employer.
59. It is well settled that a judgment of a Court is precedent for the issue of law which is raised and
decided. Words and phrases used in a judgment cannot be read in isolation, out of context. To quote
the distinguished author V. Sudhish Pai “Judgments and observations in judgments are not to be
read as Euclid’s theorems or as provisions of statute. Judicial utterances/pronouncements are in the
setting of the facts of a particular case. To interpret words and provisions of a statute it may become
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/153664247/ 20Indian Oil Corporation ... vs M/S. Shree Ganesh Petroleum ... on 1 February, 2022
necessary for judges to embark upon lengthy discussions, but such discussion is meant to explain
not define.
Judges interpret statutes, their words are not be interpreted as statutes. Thus, precedents are not to
be read as statutes.”8 8 . Constitutional Supremacy-A Revisit, Essays on Constitutionalism, Rule of
Law & Constitutional Adjudication by Mr. V. Sudhish Pai
60. For the reasons discussed above, the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment of High Court is
set aside. The impugned judgment of the District Court insofar as the same pertains to lease rent
and lease period is also set aside.
61. The impugned award dated 04.11.2010 is set aside to the extent that the Arbitrator has increased
the monthly lease rent of the land in question from Rs.1750/- to Rs.10000/- with 10% increase after
every three years w.e.f. the date of the termination of the dealership and to the extent the Arbitrator
has reduced the period of lease from 29 years to 19 years and 11 months.
