improvement/upgradation of Mandi Phagla Buffliaz Road From KM 6 th to KM 15th on Mandi Side
and KM 6th to KM 16th on Buffliaz side and construction of road (new) from KM 16th to KM 25th
on Mandi side and KM 17th to KM 37th on Buffliaz side by way of earth work cutting, X- drainage
work, protection works, pavements etc. under CRF; with a further direction to the respondents to
make funds available so as to enable the petitioner to execute the balance work after releasing the
admitted payment of Rs.1,89,51,180/- due to the petitioner on account of works already executed by
the petitioner.
FACTUAL MATRIX :
2. The petitioner is a Company registered under the Indian Companies Act.
It is stated that the petitioner-Company is a leading EPC (Engineering, Procurement and
Construction) Company in India in the energy and infrastructure sectors and is providing the
services of Project Management, Engineering and Civil infrastructure since 1994.
3. Respondent No.4 vide NIT No.8006-44 dated 14.12.2009 invited bids for execution of the
following works:
"Improvement/upgradation of Mandi Phagla Buffliaz Road From KM 6th to KM 15th
on Mandi Side and KM 6th to KM 16th on Buffliaz side and construction of road
(new) from KM 16th to KM 25th on Mandi side and KM 17th to KM 37th on Buffliaz
side by way of earth work cutting, X-drainage work, protection works, pavements etc.
under CRF."
4. It is stated that the petitioner-Company being fully eligible also participated in the bidding
process and the bid of the petitioner was accepted vide Letter of acceptance bearing No.
CEJ/DB/1601-04 dated 30.04.2010, the work in question was allotted to the petitioner for the
contract price of Rs.38,80,33,524/- (Rupees Thirty Eight Crore Eighty Lac and Thirty Three
Thousand Five Hundred and Twenty Four only), vide allotment letter No. CEJ/G/3931-33 dated
04.06.2010. It is further stated that the contract was allotted to the petitioner after the same was
approved in the Contract Committee Meeting held under the Chairmanship of
Commissioner/Secretary to Government Public Works (R&B) department i.e. respondent No.1 on
16.04.2010 and subsequently in the minutes of the meeting issued by the office of respondent No.2
vide Office No. CEJ/CC/PWD (R&B)/Minutes/S/2003-07 dated 29.04.2010.
5. It is stated that after having been allotted the work, the petitioner-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/101949421/ 2M/S Eci Engineering & ... vs Union Territory Of Jammu And ... on 1 November, 2023
Company was handed over the site and the work was strictly initiated in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the allotment in the year 2010 itself. Since the work
was executed in phases, as such, during the period of the execution of the work, bills
were submitted in running account i.e. after executing a particular portion of the
work, bills were submitted to the department and department after verifying the
works, releases the payment. Similarly, after executing the further work, the next
running account bill was submitted and after completion of the work a final bill was
submitted for the release of the final payment.
6. It is stated that with respect to the work in question, after the acceptance of the bid of the
petitioner-Company, it commenced work as per the terms and conditions of the allotment of
contract and as much as 95.15% of the total work was completed by the petitioner in the year 2019.
Since the contract in question was an item rated contract i.e. for each and every item of work, rates
had been quoted and thereafter final value of the bid amount was given, as such, with execution of
work in part, running account bills were submitted and payments were also released in favour of the
petitioner.
7. It is further stated that the petitioner submitted running account bills and payments amounting to
Rs.35,02,59,902/- were released in favour of the petitioner which was about 90.26% of the allotted
amount. Petitioner- Company thereafter submitted its last two bills having Serial No. 54 for an
amount of Rs.1,13,79,380/- and Serial No. 55 for an amount of Rs.75,71,800/- but the same have not
been released in favour of the petitioner till date.
8. It is stated that the claim of the petitioner-Company was verified by the respondent-department
but the bills submitted by the petitioner were returned on 01.08.2019 with the remarks that "funds
are not available". It is further stated that the respondents have not disputed the amount due to the
petitioner but the same has not been released despite the fact that the amount due to the petitioner
is admitted by the respondents. It is also stated by the petitioner that it is absolutely illegal on the
part of the respondents to withhold the admitted amount due to the petitioner for the works already
being executed by the petitioner.
9. Per contra, the reply has been filed by the respondents and in reply to para nos. 8 to 11, it is stated
that the work done claim was again raised by the department against the work executed by the
Contractor in CC 54th and CC 55th amounting to Rs.113.79 lacs and Rs.75.71 lacs respectively but
due to non-availability of funds payment could not be made/processed to the contractor till date.
10. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the material on record.
11. The only grievance of the petitioner in the instant petition is that though the respondents have
admitted the liability and have already released an amount of Rs.35,02,59,902/- out of the total
contract amount but the remaining admitted amount of Rs.1,89,51,180/- is still pending to be
released in favour of the petitioner which as per respondents could not be released due to paucity of
funds.

12. Mr. Rahul Pant, learned Senior counsel, has relied upon the Division Bench Judgment of this
Court rendered in LPA No. 137/2020 titled "Union Territory of J&K and others vs. Sanjeev Kumar"
dated 23.02.2021, wherein it is held as under :
"15. The extent of applicability of Article 14 in contractual matters, where the State
was a party, came up for consideration in the case of "M/s Radhakrishna Agarwal and
ors Vs State of Bihar & ors," (1977) 3 SCC 457, wherein the Apex Court held as
under:-
"10. It is thus clear that the Erusian Equipment & Chemicals Ltd.'s case (supra)
involved discrimination at the very threshold or at the time of entry into the field of
consideration of persons with whom the Government could contract at all. At this
stage, no doubt, the State acts purely in its executive capacity and is bound by the
obligations which dealings of the State with the individual citizens import into every
transaction entered into in exercise of its constitutional powers. But, after the State or
its agents have entered into the field of ordinary contract, the relations are no longer
governed by the constitutional provisions but by the legally valid contract which
determines rights and obligations of the parties inter se. No question arises of
violation of Article 14 or of any other constitutional provision when the State or its
agents, purporting to act within this field, perform any act. In this sphere, they can
only claim rights conferred upon them by contract and are bound by the terms of the
contract only unless some statute steps in and confers some special statutory power
or obligation on the State in the contractual field which is apart from contract."
16. Subsequently, however, in "Verigamto Naveen Vs Govt. of A.P. & ors," (2001) 8
SCC 344, the Apex Court held that if the breach of contract involved breach of
statutory obligation when the order complained of was made in exercise of statutory
power by a statutory authority, though cause of action even when arising out of
contract, brought it within the sphere of public law. It was held in paragraph 21 as
under:-
"21....... In cases where the decision making authority exceeded its statutory power or
committed breach of rules or principles of natural justice in exercise of such power or
its decision is perverse or passed an irrational order, this Court has interceded even
after the contract was entered into between the parties and the Government and its
agencies. We may advert to three decisions of this Court in M/s Dwarkadas Marfatia
& Sons vs. Board of Trustees of the Port of Bombay; Mahabir Auto Stores & Ors. vs.
Indian Oil Corporation & Ors.; and Srilekha Vidyarthi vs. State of U.P.. Where the
breach of contract involves breach of statutory obligation when the order complained
of was made in exercise of statutory power by a statutory authority, though cause of
action arises out of or pertains to contract, brings within the sphere of public law
because the power exercised is apart from contract."

"19. The issue was also considered at length in ABL International Limited Vs Export
Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Limited and noticing the various judgments
on the point, the following legal principles were crystallized regarding maintainability
of the writ petition:-
a. In an appropriate case, a writ petition as against the State or an instrumentality of
the State arising out of the contractual obligations is maintainable.
b. Merely because some disputed questions of fact arise for consideration, same
cannot be a ground to refuse to entertain a writ petition in all cases, as a matter of
rule.
c. A writ petition involving the consequential benefit of monetary claims is also
maintainable.
"20. The Court further proceeded to hold that in entertaining the writs under Article
226, the Court has the discretion to entertain or not to entertain the petition and with
reference to "Whirlpool Corporation Vs Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai & ors,"
1998 (8) SCC 1, it was held that the prerogative writ will not normally be exercised by
the Court to the exclusion of other available remedies unless such action of the State
or its instrumentality is arbitrary and unreasonable so as to violate the constitutional
mandate of Article 14 or for other valid and legitimate reasons, for which the Court
thinks it necessary to exercise the writ jurisdiction."
13. Learned Senior counsel, Mr. Rahul Pant, has stated that respondents herein can neither delay
nor refuse the payment to the tune of Rs.1,89,51,180/- due to the petitioner-Company on the ground
of non- availability of funds. Admittedly, the petitioner-Company has been allotted contract by the
competent authority and after execution of the allotted work it has been verified by the concerned
authority, as such, it doesn(cid:128)t lie in the mouth of the respondents to withhold the admitted
amount/liability in favour of the petitioner on account of non-availability of funds.
14. Mr. Ravinder Gupta, learned Additional Advocate General, has stated that the liability has been
admitted by the respondents but due to paucity of funds, the same could not be released in favour of
the petitioner till date.
15. The petitioner-Company cannot be made to wait endlessly and indefinitely for the release of the
payments on the ground of unavailability of funds. The work was executed and verified in the year
2010 but the bills have not been cleared from the last more than 13 years, which is not only illegal
but also arbitrary action on the part of the respondents.
16. In RFA No. 136/2017 & CM Appl. 4704/2017 titled "North Delhi Municipal Corporation and anr.
V. Amit Tanwar" decided on 22nd March, 2018, the Delhi High Court has held as under :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/101949421/ 5M/S Eci Engineering & ... vs Union Territory Of Jammu And ... on 1 November, 2023
"34. It is slightly unfathomable as to how the Corporation can postpone the payment
to the Contractor, indefinitely. The issuance of the tender and the work order in
favour of the Contractor has to be on the pre-condition that funds are available with
the Corporation. To ask the Contractor to wait endlessly for his payment is wholly
arbitrary. The Corporation which hands over the works contract to the Contractor
cannot say "Do the work now, I will pay when I have the money". Even if such a
clause has been signed and accepted by the Contractor, it does not make the clause
valid inasmuch as it would render a fundamental condition of contract being hit by
provisions of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (hereinafter, „Contract Act(cid:128)). Every
contract, to be valid, has to have consideration and the indefinite postponement of
consideration would be wholly unconscionable. In fact a Single Judge of this Court in
Jagbir Singh Sharma v. Municipal Corporation of Delhi [order dated 15th July, 2007
in CS(OS) 1797/2007] (hereinafter, „Jagbir Singh(cid:128)), while dealing with Clause 9 of
the General Conditions of Contract (as it then stood) has held as under:
"7. ...A careful reading of the said clause indicates that it stipulates two different time
periods for making payment. In cases where tendered value of the work is up to Rs.5
lakhs, payment is required to be made within three months and where the tendered
value of the work exceeds Rs.5 lakhs, the payment is to be made within six months.
Learned counsel for the defendant submitted that the contract uses the expression
"as far as possible". This expression to my mind supports the case of the Plaintiffs.
The expression "as far as possible" is a pointer that every endeavor should be made
by MCD to make payment within the time period stipulated in Clause 9. Normally
and in due course, payments will be made within the time limit mentioned. The
applications filed for leave to defend do not set out and give any reason for the delay
in making the payments. Normally, payment should be made within a reasonable
time after the contract has been executed and the party has performed his obligations
under the contract. Section 46 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 stipulates that where
no time limit is specified, the engagement must be performed within a reasonable
time.
8. In the applications for leave to defend, it is stated that payments will be made as
and when funds in a particular budget head are available with the MCD. Ex facie, the
stand taken in the leave to defend applications cannot be accepted and has to be
rejected. Once the defendant-MCD admits its obligation to make payment, the said
payment has to be arranged for and budgeted for by them. The plaintiffs have no role
to play in the said exercise. How the defendant manages their internal affairs is their
own business. In fact, Clause 9 of the Contract stipulates that "as far as possible the
MCD will make endeavor to make the payment within the said period"....."
17. As such, the delay in releasing the admitted liability only on the ground of
paucity/unavailability of funds cannot be a defense that the petitioner- Company
should suffer for non-payment for years endlessly, for the works already executed by
the petitioner-Company.

18. In view of the aforesaid discussion, the instant writ petition is disposed of with a
direction to the respondents to release an admitted liability to the tune of
Rs.1,89,51,180/- in favour of the petitioner-Company within a period of six months
from the date a certified copy of this order is furnished to them by the petitioner.
