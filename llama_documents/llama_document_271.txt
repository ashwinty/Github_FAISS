JUDGMENT
M.N. Rao, J.
1. In this batch of six cases, the common question for consideration concern the application of
section 5-E of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act")
to the hire transaction of M/s. I.T.C. Classic Finance and Services Ltd., Secunderabad - the appellant
in Spl. Appeal No. 1 of 1995 and the petitioner in the other five write petitions. We are, therefore,
inclined to dispose of all the six cases by this common judgment.
2. M/s. Classic Finance and Services Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "the assessee") is a limited
company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, with its registered office at 5/2, Russel
Street and branch office at No. 31, Sarojini Devi Road, Secunderabad. The assessee is registered
dealer under the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act and the Central Sales Tax Act. It ia a finance
company. It hires machinery, plant and equipment to different parties for rent. It purchases goods
according to the specifications of the customers and instructs the supplier/manufacturer to consign
the goods directly to the customer, who takes the same on hire.
3. During the assessment year 1988-89, the total receipts of the assessee towards rentals received
came to Rs. 1,23,48,118 and in respect of the entire turnover, the assessee claimed exemption on the
ground that the same was not exigible to tax under section 5-E of the Act since such an assessment
would be violative of the provisions of article 286 of the Constitution of India read with section 4 of
the Central Sales Tax Act and section 38 of the Act relying upon the ruling of the Supreme Court in
Builders Association of India v. Union of India [1989] 73 STC 370. The assessing authority-the
Commercial Tax Officer, S.D. Road Circle, Secunderabad-rejected the claim of the assessee on the
view that "the dealer received the lease amounts as against outside assets leased out in Andhra
Pradesh. The assets received from outside the State did not suffer tax under the APGST Act. Hence
their claim of exemption is not considered". After giving exemption to a turnover of Rs. 83,28,954,
which represented local purchases from registered dealers, the assessing authority brought to tax
the balance of the turnover of Rs. 40,19,164. The entire turnover subjected to tax represent rentals
received and receivable by the assessee against assets purchased from outside the State of Andhra
Pradesh and leased out in the State of Andhra Pradesh. This turnover was classified under two
heads by the assessing authority : (i) rentals receivable and received against the asset purchased
outside the State and leased out in Andhra Pradesh (collected at Hyderabad); and (ii) rentals
received against the assets moved from outside the State and leased out in Andhra Pradesh.

4. Aggrieved by that, the assessee carried the matter in appeal to the Appellate Deputy
Commissioner, Commercial Taxes, who, by his order dated April 27, 1994, in Appeal No.
B/57/93-94, relying upon the decisions of the Supreme Court in Builders Association of India
[1989] 73 STC 370 and Gannon Dunkerley & Co. v. State of Rajasthan [1993] 88 STC 204 accepted
the contentions raised on behalf of the assessee that the goods have been purchased from outside
the State in pursuance of a completed contract of lease and the goods have directly moved from
outside the State to the lessee and granted relief in respect of a turnover of Rs. 26,78,987 in regard
to which "the authorised representative placed evidence" and dismissed the appeal in respect of the
balance of the turnover - Rs. 9,89,702 for which no evidence could be produced.
5. The Commissioner of Commercial Taxes felt that the view taken by the Appellate Deputy
Commissioner "was prejudicial to the interests of the Revenue" in the light of the judgment of the
Bombay High Court in 20th Century Finance Corporation Limited v. State of Maharashtra [1989] 75
STC 217. A show cause notice was, therefore, issued by the Commissioner in his Ref. L.V(1) 1122/94
dated October 15, 1994, proposing to revise the appellate order by setting it aside under section
20(1) of the Act and restore the original assessment order passed by the Commercial Tax Officer on
March 23, 1993 and called upon the assessee to produce all documentary evidence in support of its
contentions that the turnover, in respect of which relief was granted by the Appellate Deputy
Commissioner was not liable to tax under section 5-E. It was mentioned in the show cause notice
that the Appellate Deputy Commissioner has also not taken into account :
"1. The lessor, i.e., Classic Finance is the owner of the goods as per agreement.
2. They issued 'C' forms for the purchase of machinery to be leased out.
3. Though the goods were moved from other States, they were put to use in Andhra
Pradesh only where the taxable event occurred." A detailed reply, citing various
decisions of the Supreme Court and several High Courts, was submitted by the
assessee on December 23, 1994. The assessee has pointed out the difference between
section 2(10) of the Maharashtra General Sales Tax Act defining the expression
"sale", which was considered by the Bombay High Court in 20th Century Finance
Corporation Limited [1989] 75 STC 217 and section 2(n) of the APGST Act and
pleaded that the assessment order was passed by the Commercial Tax Officer without
any investigation into the full facts of the case, without correctly understanding and
applying the relevant case law and that the transactions in question being inter-State
transactions, the same are immune from exigibility to tax under section 5-E of the
Act. By his order dated December 28, 1994, passed under section 20(1) of the Act in
proceedings No. L.V(1)/ 1122/94, the Commissioner, rejected the explanation of the
assessee, set aside the order of the Appellate Deputy Commissioner and restored the
original assessment order. The following is the reasoning discernible from the order
of the Commissioner for allowing the revision :
6. The assessee purchased the goods and gave instructions to the manufacturer to deliver the goods
to the lessees and so "the movement of the goods originated from the manufacturer of the goods and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1894003/ 2I. T. C. Classic Finance And Services vs Commissioner Of Commercial Taxes on 7 March, 1995
that movement started because of the purchase order placed by the assessee with the manufacturer
outside the State of Andhra Pradesh. And so the cause of action for the inter-State movement of the
goods was the purchase order placed by the assessee with the manufacturer which, incidentally,
might have dated by the lease agreement. To say that the lease agreement occasions the movement
of the goods is not correct. It is only the purchase order which occasioned the movement of the
goods, for in the absence of the the purchase order, with the lease agreement only, the movement of
the goods could not have begun. Hence to say that the contract of lease is an inter-State sale is not
correct. In case the lessee had directly ordered the goods on lease with the manufacturer, and the
manufacturer moved the goods based on the lease agreement to the lessee directly, then it might be
possible to say that the lease agreement occasioned the movement of the goods; and that the lease,
as a deemed sale, is an inter-State sale. The intermediation of the assessee herein removes. law
direct link between the lessee and the manufacturer of the goods. They are two different and
independent transactions, viz., lease agreement and purchase order.
7. The transfer of the right to use the goods necessarily involves delivery of possession from the
transferor to the transferee and such delivery is different from custody. "The taxable event under
section 5-E takes place only if physical possession of the goods is given to the lessee". There is
difference between appropriation of the goods involved in an inter-State sale between the
manufacturer and the assessee and the appropriation of the goods to the lease contract between the
assessee and the lessee. The first appropriation is complete when the manufacturer consigns the
goods to inter-State sale with the assessee but the second takes place only when the goods are
physically delivered to the lessee for, "for a deemed sale under section 5-E of the APGST Act,
physical possession is a must. Only then, there can be a real and usable right to use the goods".
Distinguishing a lease transaction from an outright sale, the Commissioner observed : "wherever the
lease transaction might have originated, when the goods are within the State of Andhra Pradesh, the
lease rentals arising for that period when the lease rights are enjoyed within the State of Andhra
Pradesh, that part of the lease agreement has to be treated as a deemed sale within the State of
Andhra Pradesh and is liable to tax under section 5-E of the Act".
8. Aggrieved by that, the assessee preferred statutory appeal under section 23(1) of the Act to this
Court - Spl. A. No. 1 of 1995. In respect of five assessment years, the assessee filed five writ petitions
as detailed below :

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
In respect of the assessment years 1989-90 and 1990-91, final assessment orders
were passed on January 21, 1994 and October 11, 1994 respectively. The final
assessment for the assessment year 1989-90 was Rs. 3,25,280, which was already
paid. The final assessment for the year 1990-91 was Rs. 3,65,268 but the tax as per
the provisional assessment was Rs. 4,93,275, the excess tax paid was Rs. 1,28,007.
The final assessment orders were passed during the pendency of the writ petitions.
For the assessment years 1989-90 and 1990-91, no appeals were filed against the
final assessments but in respect of the assessment year 1993-94, an appeal was filed
but stay was declined by the appellate authority.
9. Before considering the contentions advanced, it is necessary to notice the relevant decisional law,
constitutional and statutory provisions .
10. In Gannon Dunkerley & Co. (Madras) Ltd. v. State of Madras [1954] 5 STC 216 (Mad.); AIR 1954
Mad. 1130, certain turnovers (after deducting certain percentage towards labour charges)
representing the monies received by the company in respect of certain contracts carried out were
subjected to tax under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939. The turnovers represented the value
of the materials used in building contracts. The assessment was challenged on the ground that there
was no element of sale of the materials in a building contract and that such a contract was an
integral one which could not be split-up. The Madras High Court held that the transactions were not
contracts for sale of goods as defined under the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, which was
in force on the date on which the Constitution of India came into force and, therefore, the company
was not liable to pay sales tax on the disputed turnovers. On the same question, there was
divergence of opinion by different High Courts. Ultimately, the Supreme Court of India in State of
Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley & Co. (Madras) Ltd. [1958] 9 STC 353 affirmed the view taken by the
Madras High Court overruling the contrary view taken by the High Courts of Nagpur, Rajasthan,
Mysore and Kerala. The Government of India also received reports from the State Governments that
large scale avoidance of Central sales tax leviable on inter-State sale of goods was taking place
through the device of sending goods from one State to another. In Northern India Caterers (India)
Ltd. v. Lt. Governor of Delhi [1978] 42 STC 386, the Supreme Court ruled that the receipts from
food and drinks supplied to guests staying in a hotel could not be split up into one of service and the
other of sale of food and drinks and so, the proprietor, who provides many services in addition to
the supply of food was not liable to pay sales tax on the value of the goods supplied by him. The Law
Commission of India considered all these matters in its 61st Report and recommended certain
amendments to the Constitution of India, in consequence of which, Parliament enacted the
Constitution (Forty-sixth Amendment) Act, 1982, by which clause (29A) was inserted in article 366.
It reads :
"(29A) 'tax on the sale or purchase of goods' includes -
(a) a tax on the transfer, otherwise than in pursuance of a contract, of property in any
goods for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1894003/ 4I. T. C. Classic Finance And Services vs Commissioner Of Commercial Taxes on 7 March, 1995
(b) a tax on the transfer of property in goods (whether as goods or in some other
form) involved in the execution of a works contract
(c) a tax on the delivery of goods on hire-purchase or any system of payment by
instalments
(d) a tax on the transfer of the right to use any goods for any purpose (whether or not
for a specified period) for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;
(e) a tax on the supply of goods by any unincorporated association or body of persons
to a member thereof for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;
(f) a tax on the supply, by way of or as part of any service or in any other manner
whatsoever, of goods, being food or any other article for human consumption or any
drink (whether or not intoxicating), where such supply or service, is for cash,
deferred payment or other valuable consideration, and such transfer, delivery or
supply of any goods shall be deemed to be a sale of those goods by the person making
the transfer, delivery or supply and a purchase of those goods by the person to whom
such transfer, delivery or supply is made."
11. Entry 92-A of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution confers power on the Union to
levy tax on sale and purchase of goods other than newspapers where such sale or purchase takes
place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. Entry 54 of List II of the Seventh Schedule
confers power on the State Legislatures to levy tax on the sale or purchase of goods other than
newspapers subject to the provisions of entry 92-A of List I.
12. Clause (1) of article 286 injuncts a State from making any law for the purpose of imposing or
authorising imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such a sale or purchase takes
place (a) outside the State; or (b) in the course of the import of the goods into or export of the goods
out of, the territory of India. Parliament is empowered by clause (2) to formulate principles to
determine when a sale or purchase of goods takes place in any of the ways mentioned in clause (1).
Clause (3) of article 286 was substituted by a new clause, which reads :
" (3) Any law of a State shall, in so far as it imposes, or authorises the imposition of, -
(a) a tax on the sale or purchase of goods declared by Parliament by law to be of
special importance in inter-State trade or commerce; or
(b) a tax on the sale or purchase of goods, being a tax of the nature referred to in
sub-clause (b), sub-clause (c) or sub-clause (d) of clause (29A) of article 366, be
subject to such restrictions and conditions in regard to the system of levy, rates and
other incidents of the tax as Parliament may by law specify."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1894003/ 5I. T. C. Classic Finance And Services vs Commissioner Of Commercial Taxes on 7 March, 1995
13. Sections 3 and 4 of the Central Sales Tax Act contain provisions as to when a sale or purchase of
goods is said to take place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce and outside a State. These
limitations are incorporated in section 38 of the APGST Act.
14. By virtue of the Constitution (Forty-sixth Amendment) Act, legislative power was conferred on
State Legislatures to levy sales tax on transactions which are strictly not sales falling within the
purview of the Sale of Goods Act but covered by sub-clauses (a) to (f) of clause (29A) of article 366 of
the Constitution, and accordingly, various State Legislatures brought amendments to the sales tax
laws. In the State of Andhra Pradesh, it was done by Act No. 18 of 1985 which came into force with
effect from July 1, 1985. Section 2(n) defines the expression "sale" as follows :
"(n) 'Sale' with all its grammatical variations and cognate expressions means every
transfer of the property in goods whether as such goods or in any other form in
pursuance of a contract or otherwise by one person to another in the course of trade
or business, for cash, or for deferred payment, or for any other valuable consideration
or in the supply or distribution of goods by a society including a co-operative society,
club, firm or association to its members, but does not include a mortgage,
hypothecation or pledge of, or a charge on goods.
Explanation I. - ............
Explanation II. - (a) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Indian Sale of Goods Act, 1930
(Central Act III of 1930) a sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed, for the purpose of this Act to
have taken place in the State, wherever the contract of sale or purchase might have been made, if the
goods are within the State.
(i) in the case of specific or ascertained goods, at the time the contract of sale or
purchase is made; and
(ii) in the case of unascertained or future goods, at the time of their appropriation to
the contract of sale or purchase by the seller or by the purchaser, whether the assent
of the other party is prior or subsequent to such appropriation.
(b) Where there is a single contract of sale or purchase of goods situated at more
places than one, the provisions of clause (a) shall apply as if there were separate
contracts in respect of the goods at each of such places.
Explanation III. - Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or in the Indian Sale of Goods Act,
1930 (Central. Act III of 1930), two independent sales or purchases shall for the purposes of this Act,
be deemed to have taken place, (1) when the goods are transferred from a principal to his selling
agent and from the selling agent to his purchaser; or (2) when the goods are transferred from the
seller to a buying agent and from the buying agent to his principal, if the agent is found in either of
the cases aforesaid -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1894003/ 6I. T. C. Classic Finance And Services vs Commissioner Of Commercial Taxes on 7 March, 1995
(i) to have sold the goods at one rate and have passed on the sale proceeds to his principal at another
rate; or
(ii) to have purchased the goods at one rate and to have passed them on to his principal at another
rate; or
(iii) not to have accounted to his principal for the entire collections or deductions made by him, in
the sales or purchases effected by him on behalf of his principal; or
(iv) to have acted for a fictitious or non-existent principal Explanation IV. - A transfer of right to use
any goods for any purpose (whether or not for a specified period) for cash, deferred payment or
other valuable consideration shall be deemed to be a sale."
15. Section 5 speaks of levy of tax on sales or purchases of goods, every dealer is liable to pay a tax
under the Act on every rupee of his turnover of sales or purchases of goods in each year irrespective
of the quantum of his turnover at the rates of tax and at the points of levy specified in the Schedules.
Section 5-E, on the basis of which the disputed turnovers were brought to tax, is in the following
terms :
"5-E. Tax on the amount realised in respect of any right to use goods. - Every dealer
who transfers the right to use any goods for any purpose, whatsoever, whether or not
for a specified period, to any lessee or licensee for cash, deferred payment or other
valuable consideration, in the course of his business shall, on the total amount
realised or realisable by him by way of payment in cash or otherwise on such transfer
or transfers of the right to use such goods from the lessee or licensee, pay a tax at the
rate of five paise in every rupee of the aggregate of such amount realised or realisable
by him during the year :
Provided that no such tax shall be levied if the total turnover of the dealer including
such aggregate is less than Rs. 1,00,000."
The transactions covered by section 5-E are one kind of bailments.
16. Sri Anantha Babu, learned counsel for the assessee, has urged that deemed sales cannot be
distinguished from ordinary sales for the purpose of taxation under the Act. If the goods hired by the
assessee were brought from outside the State into the State of Andhra Pradesh for fulfilling the
contract of hire, they are inter-State transactions not amenable to tax under the Act. The movement
of the goods was as a result of a contract of sale. It was only when the customers place orders, the
assessee purchases the goods from the manufacturers, who consign the goods directly to the
customers. But for the orders received from the customers, the assessee would not have purchased
the goods from the manufacturers. There was no privity of contract between the customers of the
assessee and the manufacturer of the goods and when the manufacturer delivered the goods to a
common carrier, the delivery; in fact to the assessee and in law it constitutes also a delivery by the
assessee to its customer. Where goods are handed over, to a common carrier, delivery in terms of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1894003/ 7I. T. C. Classic Finance And Services vs Commissioner Of Commercial Taxes on 7 March, 1995
section 149 of the Contract Act is effected and, therefore, the taxable event occurs only India State
(Tamil Nadu) from where the movement of goods had begins. The taxable transaction being the
transfer is liable to tax under section 5-E is not the totality of the property in the goods but only to
use. In determining whether a particular transaction is an inter-State transaction, the situs is not
relevant. If a literal construction of section 2(n) were to lead to the conclusion that even inter-State
transactions could be brought to tax. The provision would be unconstitutional and so in order to
avoid such an eventuality, it must be read down as excluding inter-State transactions.
17. The second contention urged by the learned counsel is that the pattern of taxation under the Act
is to subject every commodity to tax only at one point. The hiring, according to the learned counsel,
being a second sale, the charges collected by the assessee, therefore, are not liable to tax under
section 5-E.
18. The third contention urged is that by virtue of G.O.Ms. No. 1388 dated December 23, 1985,
which was rescinded with effect from July 7, 1993, in respect of transactions for which the taxable
event has occurred prior to July 7, 1993, exemption was in force and, therefore, they are immune
from taxation. That immunity is not destroyed by the subsequent withdrawal of the exemption
notification because the exemption was to the dealer and not to any portion of the turnover exigible
to tax in a particular assessment year. The learned counsel also submitted written arguments.
19. In opposition to this, the learned Government Pleader advanced a threshold argument that the
writ petitions are not maintainable since the assessee has an effective alternative remedy by way of
an appeal provided under the statute. Alternatively, he urges that even on the merits, the special
appeal as well as the writ petitions deserve to be dismissed. A transaction of sale is different from
hiring goods for remuneration; both are independent transactions and are exigible to tax separately.
While conceding that inter-State transactions cannot be subjected to tax by a State law because of
the constitutional limitations engrafted in article 286 of the Constitution, the provisions of sections
3 and 4 of the Central Sales Tax Act and section 38 of the APGST Act, he has laid emphasis on the
aspect that the transactions in question are independent of inter-State transactions. Only on the hire
charges received by the assessee in respect of the goods which were hired out in the State of Andhra
Pradesh, tax is levied under section 5-E and, therefore, the same cannot be faulted. In support of
these contentions, reliance was placed upon the decision of the Bombay High Court in 20th Century
Finance Corporation Limited [1989] 75 STC 217.
20. In view of the final order passed by the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes while exercising
revisional jurisdiction under section 20(1) of the Act that "the lease rentals received by the assessee
from his customers (lessees) are in respect of the goods purchased outside the State and directly
delivered to the customers", we are not inclined to accept the contention of the learned Government
Pleader that the writ petitions should be dismissed on the ground of availability of alternative
remedy. The appellate authority will naturally be inclined to follow the view taken by the revisional
authority.
21. We will deal first with Special Appeal No. 1 of 1995 wherein the revisional order of the
Commissioner of Commercial Taxes is challenged. In the impugned order, the Commissioner,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1894003/ 8I. T. C. Classic Finance And Services vs Commissioner Of Commercial Taxes on 7 March, 1995
illustratively, has discussed one transaction between the assessee and M/s. Railis India Limited,
presumably due to the reason that all the other transactions are similar. M/s. Rallis India Ltd.,
Secunderabad, addressed a letter dated February 21, 1988 to the assessee for taking on lease, a
photo copier with 2 KVA voltage stabilizer. It reads :
"We are interested in taking on lease from you on standard conditions, the following
equipments :
Details of equipment Name of manufacturer/supplier
1. Photo copier Modi xerox 2 2 KVA V. Stabilizer Modi xerox We have inspected the
abovesaid equipments at the manufacturer's/supplier's place. We request you to
please purchase the abovementioned equipments and arrange to transport the same
from the place of supplier/manufacturer directly to our place of business mentioned
hereunder :
Railis India Limited, 1-7-241/11, S.D. Road, Secunderabad.
12. We undertake to abide by the mutually agreed special terms and conditions which
are hereinafter set forth.
1. Lease rental : Rs. 7,567 per quarter.
2. Lease management fee : at 1 per cent of the cost of the equipment.
3. Minimum residual value :- per cent of the cost of the equipment.
4. We have placed an order on our supplier M/s. Modi Xerox Ltd., Rampur, which
you may please confirm.
We look forward to have a mutually beneficial business relationship."
23. The letter clearly shows that the equipment was already inspected by the customer at the place
of the manufacturer/supplier and also placed an order for supply in anticipation of confirmation by
the assessee. The manufacturer - M/s. Modi Xerox-raised an invoice dated March 7, 1988, against
the assessee showing the consignee's address as M/s. Rallis India Limited, the lessee of the assessee.
The agreement for lease of the equipment between the assessee and the lessee-M/s. Rallis India
Limited-concluded on April 6, 1988, was for a period of 60 months renewable with mutual consent.
It was concluded at Calcutta where the head office of the assessee is located. The lessee is referred to
as M/s. Rallis India Ltd., a company incorporated under the Companies Act with its registered office
at 21, Damodardas Sukhadwala Marg, Bombay. The details of the equipment are mentioned in the
first schedule to the agreement. It is mentioned in the agreement that the lessor (assessee) offered to
give on lease and the lessee (M/s. Rallis-India Ltd.) offered to take one, lease the equipment
mentioned in the first schedule. Both the parties declared that the lessor has handed and the lessee
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1894003/ 9I. T. C. Classic Finance And Services vs Commissioner Of Commercial Taxes on 7 March, 1995
has taken over possession of the equipment. The agreement, inter alia, incorporates the following
conditions
(i) The lessor is the absolute owner of the equipment and will not assign the rights under the
agreement in favour of any other person, than its bankers.
(ii) The possession of the equipment will be with the lessee, who shall have control over the same at
the locations indicated in column No. 3 - premises of M/s. Rallis India Ltd., at S.D. Road,
Secunderabad-and the equipment could be shifted to any other place by giving 7 days advance
notice in writing.
(iii) The lessee has declared that it has taken prior inspection of the said equipment and has satisfied
itself that each piece of equipment is suitable for its use and the purpose for which it is being taken
on lease and that the lease has been taken subject to any fault or defect which any piece of
equipment may suffer and that the lessee will not hold the lessor responsible for any inadequacy in
any piece of equipment. Notwithstanding the grant of lease of the equipment, the lessor shall
continue to be the sole owner and the lessee would not have any right, title or interest in the same.
(iv) The lessor shall have the right at all reasonable time to inspect any piece of equipment and for
that purpose shall have access to any factory, building or other location at which the equipment may
be installed.
(v) The lessee is liable to pay any sales tax or purchase tax that may be imposed in respect of the
lease. The details of the rentals mutually agreed are specified in column Nos. 5 and 6 of the first
schedule. If the lease is not renewed, the lessee shall deliver possession at or before the expiry of the
lease.
24. From a reading of the clauses in the agreement, it is clear that the transaction is a bailment as
defined by section 148 of the Indian Contract Act. The assessee is the bailor and M/s. Rallis India
Ltd., is the bailee under the contract. The delivery of the goods is under the contract. The purpose
for which the goods are delivered 'the duration and the obligation to return after the purpose is
accomplished and other details are incorporated in the agreement. Section 149 of the Contract Act
says that a delivery to the bailee may be made by doing anything effect of putting the goods in the
possession of the intended bailee or of any person authorised to hold them on his behalf.
Sub-section (2) of section 23 of the Sale of Goods Act lays down, inter alia, that if in pursuance of a
contract, the seller delivers the goods to a common carrier for the purpose of transmission to the
buyer, he is deemed to have unconditionally appropriated the goods to the contract. A Division
Bench of this Court in Rashtriya ispat Nigam Ltd. v. Commercial Tax Officer [1990] 77 STC 182
interpreting section 5-E of the Act held that it incorporates one category of bailments as defined in
Halsbury's Laws of England (Fourth Edition) at paragraph 1551 :
"It is a contract by which the hirer obtains a right to use the chattel hired in return for
the payment to the owner of the price of the hiring".
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1894003/ 10I. T. C. Classic Finance And Services vs Commissioner Of Commercial Taxes on 7 March, 1995
and it is this category of bailments that is the tax base under section 5-E. "The taxable event under
section 5-E is the transfer of the right to use any goods. What does this phrase connote ? This means
that unless there is a transfer of the right to use the goods, no occasion for levying tax arises;
providing a facility which involves the use of the goods nor even a right to use the goods is not
enough, there must be a transfer of that right".
25. Another Division Bench in State Bank of India v. State of Andhra Pradesh [1988] 70 STC 215
expressed the view that delivery is essential in a case of bailment which is sought to be brought
under section 5-E of the Act. In paragraph 60 of the revisional order, the Commissioner has
observed :
"........ it is admitted and confirmed that the assessee purchased the goods, that they
were the owner of the goods and gave instructions for delivering the goods to a
particular address which was the address of the lessee."
26. After stating the aforesaid admitted fact, the Commissioner proceeded to discuss the question
whether the movement of the goods originated with the contract of lease. While admitting that "the
movement of the goods originated from the manufacturer of the goods and that movement started
because of the purchase order placed by the assessee with the manufacturer outside the State of
Andhra Pradesh", the Commissioner has concluded that "the cause of action for the inter-State
movement of the goods was the purchase order placed by the assessee with the manufacturer, which
incidentally might have been motivated by the lease agreement ..... it is only the purchase order
which occasioned the movement of the goods for, in the absence of the purchase order, with the
lease agreement only, the movement of the goods could not have begun" and, therefore, to say that
the contract of lease is an inter-State sale is not correct. The lease agreement and the purchase order
according to the Commissioner are two different and independent transactions. We are not inclined
to agree. The planning of the purchase order by the assessee with the manufacturer was because of
the lease agreement with the customer. Both are integrally connected; one cannot be split up from
the other. The customer (M/s. Rallis India Ltd.) has already inspected the equipment, placed an
order with the manufacturer on behalf of the assessee and thereafter corresponded with the assessee
for confirmation and this is clear from the letter dated February 21, 1988, addressed by the customer
to the assessee, which is extracted supra. Independent of the lease agreement, such a transaction
could not have been possible. In the absence of the lease transaction, it is plain, there was no
possibility for the assessee to Place the Purchase order, with the manufacturer.
27. It is not the case of the department, in so far as Spl. Appeal No. 1 of 1995 is concerned, that there
was any single transaction in which, independently, without the request of a customer, a purchase
order was placed by the assessee with any manufacturer. As it is the admitted cage of the
department that the consignee is the customer (the lessee) and the invoice was raised against the
assessee, the delivery was effected by way of entrustment to a common carrier outside the State of
Andhra Pradesh, the consignee being the customer (lessee) within the State of Andhra Pradesh. The
Commissioner's reasoning is that there are two appropriations : the first appropriation is complete
when the manufacturer of the goods consigned them to the inter-State sale to the assessee but the
second appropriation took place only when the goods are physically delivered to the lessee for a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1894003/ 11I. T. C. Classic Finance And Services vs Commissioner Of Commercial Taxes on 7 March, 1995
deemed sale under section 5-E of the Act for, for a deemed sale under section 5-E, physical
possession is a must. The reasoning is clearly unsustainable in law. Once the goods are entrusted to
a common carrier, the carrier becomes an agent and such a delivery amounts to delivery to the
consignee (the lessee in this case). The taxable event under section 5-E of the Act is the transfer of
the right to use any goods [Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd. v. Commercial Tax Officer and State Bank of
India v. State of Andhra Pradesh and that right will be vested in the customer (the lessee) the
moment the goods are delivered to a common carrier. That right does not depend upon the "actual
physical possession" of the goods by the customer. There are no two appropriations as erroneously
held by the Commissioner-one at the stage when the goods are consigned to the inter-State sale and
the other when the customer comes into physical possession of the goods.
28. The distinction sought to be made by the Commissioner in paragraphs 63 and 64 of the order
under appeal between a lease transaction and an outright sale for the purpose of reaching the
conclusion that "wherever the lease transaction might have originated, when the goods are within
the State of Andhra Pradesh, the lease rentals arising for that period when the lease rights are
enjoyed within the State of Andhra Pradesh, that part of the lease agreement has to be treated as a
deemed, sale within the State of Andhra Pradesh,, and are liable to tax under section 5-E of the Act",
has no foundation in law. The Commissioner has not adverted to the crucial question whether the
transactions are already covered by the Central Sales Tax Act And the constitutional limitations
engrafted in article 286 and the legislative injunction incorporated in section 38 of the APGST Act.
29. In Builders Association of India [1989] 73 STC 370, one of the questions considered by the
Supreme Court was whether the power of the State Legislature to levy tax on the transfer of property
in goods involved in the execution of works contracts referred to in sub-clause (b) of clause (29A) of
article 366 of the Constitution is subject to the restrictions contained in article 286 of the
Constitution. Answering the question in the affirmative, it was held by the Constitution Bench of the
Supreme Court :
"..... The object of the new definition introduced in clause (29A) of article 366 of the
Constitution is, therefore, to enlarge the scope of 'tax on sale or purchase of goods'
wherever it occurs in the Constitution so that it may include within its scope the
transfer, delivery or supply of goods that may take place under any of the
transactions referred to in sub-clauses (a) to (f) thereof wherever such transfer,
delivery or supply becomes subject to levy of sales tax. So construed the expression
'tax on the sale or purchase of goods' in entry 54 of the State List, therefore, includes
a tax on the transfer of property in goods (whether as goods or in some other form)
involved in the execution of a works contract also."
30. The Supreme Court rejected in clear terms the contention of the State that clause (29A) of article
366 has conferred on the Legislatures of States, the power to levy tax independently of the power
conferred under entry 54 of the State List. Any tax leviable on deemed sales covered by sub-clauses
(a) to (f) of clause (29A) of article 366 would be subject to the prohibition under article 286(1). The
statement of law laid down by the Supreme Court in this regard does not admit of any ambiguity :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1894003/ 12I. T. C. Classic Finance And Services vs Commissioner Of Commercial Taxes on 7 March, 1995
"...... We are of the view that all transfers, deliveries and supplies of goods referred to
in sub-clauses (a) to (f) of clause (29A) of article 366 of the Constitution are subject
to the restrictions and conditions mentioned in clause (1), clause (2) and sub-clause
(a) of clause (3) of article 286 of the Constitution and the transfers and deliveries that
take place under sub-clauses (b), (c) and (d) of clause (29A) of article 366, of the
Constitution are subject.. to an additional restriction mentioned in sub-clause (b) of
article 286(3) of the Constitution."
31. There can be no doubt after the authoritative pronouncement of the Supreme Court in Builders
Association of India [1989] 73 STC 370 that any State law with respect to deemed sales covered by
sub-clauses (a) to (f) of clause (29A) of article 366 must conform to the requirements of article 286
and the provisions of the Central Sales Tax Act. For purposes of taxation, a deemed sale cannot be
distinguished from an ordinary sale.
32. Another Constitution Bench in Gannon Dunkerley & Co. [1993] 88 STC 204 restated the legal
position. It was held :
"...... it is not permissible for the State Legislature to make a law imposing tax on such
a deemed sale which constitutes a sale in the course of inter-State trade or commerce
under section 3 of the Central Sales Tax Act or an outside sale under section 4 of the
Central Sales Tax Act or sale in the course of import or export under section 5 of the
Central Sales Tax Act."
33. The well-accepted legal position that in order to decide whether a particular sale had taken place
in the course of an inter-State trade or commerce, the situs of the sale or purchase is wholly
irrelevant was also reiterated by the Supreme Court :
"The location of the situs of the sale in sales tax legislation of the State would,
therefore, have no bearing-on the chargeability of tax on sales in the course of
inter-State trade or commerce since they fall outside the field of legislative
competence of the State Legislatures and will have to be excluded while assessing the
tax liability under the State legislation. The same is true of sales which are outside the
State and sales in the course of import and export. The State Legislature cannot so
frame its law as to convert an outside sale or a sale in the course of import and export
into a sale inside the State."
34. The transactions covered by Special Appeal No. 1 of 1995 are clearly inter-State transactions
falling within the ambit of section 3(a) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. The movement of the
goods from the State of Madras to Hyderabad is the result of the contract. It is immaterial in which
State the property in the goods passed. What is material is that the inter-State movement must be
the result of a covenant, express or implied, in the contract of sale or an incident of the contract. It is
not necessary that the inter-State movement injust be pleaded by a sale. [English Electric Company
of India Ltd. v. Deputy Commercial Tax Officer , Balabhagas Hulaschand v. State of Orissa and
Union of India v. K. G. Khosla and Co. Ltd. ]. If the movement of the goods is because of a clause in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1894003/ 13I. T. C. Classic Finance And Services vs Commissioner Of Commercial Taxes on 7 March, 1995
the contract or as an incident of contract, the same shall he deemed to have taken place in the course
of inter-State trade or commerce. In the transaction illustratively discussed by the Commissioner,
the transport of goods from one State to another was an incident of the contract between the
assessee see. The very hiring itself is the incident of the contract of sale, which occasioned the
inter-State enjoyment of the Lyoods from Madras Andhra Pradesh. Without this contract, the goods
would not have moved out of Madras. This aspect we have already discussed while the question
whether the purchase order and the lease agreement are separate or constitute one integral
transaction.
35. It is true that Explanation II(a) to section 2(n) of the Act lays down that notwithstanding
anything contained in the Indian Sale of Goods Act, 1930, a sale or purchase of goods shall be
deemed for the purpose of the Act to have taken place in the State, wherever the contract of sale or
purchase might have been made, if the goods are within the State. If construed literally, this implies
that goods which are the subject-matter of Inter-State transactions also can be brought to tax if they
are within the State. Such an interpretation is not permissible in view of the rulings of the Supreme
Court in Builders Association of India [1989] 73 STC 370 and Gannon Dunkerley & Co. [1993] 88
STC 204. The Commissioner of Commercial Taxes erroneously relied upon the test of "situs" - the
transfer of the right to use the goods had taken place in Andhra Pradesh because the goods are
found in Andhra Pradesh.
36. The decision of the Bombay High Court in 20th Centun, Finance Corporation Limited [1989] 75
STC 217 was strongly relied upon by the Commissioner for subjecting the transactions in question to
tax under section 5-E. The constitutionality of section 2(10) of the Maharashtra Sales Tax on the
Transfer of Right to use any Goods for any purpose Act was challenged in that case before the
Bombay High Court. The impugned provision, which contained the definition of "sale" is in the
following terms :
"'Sale' means the transfer of the right to use any goods for any purpose (whether or
not for a specified period) for cash, deferred payment or any other valuable
consideration, and the word 'sell' with all its grammatical variations and cognate
expressions, shall be construed accordingly.
Explanation. - For the purposes of this clause, the transfer of the right to use any such
goods shall be deemed to have taken place in the State of Maharashtra, if the goods
are in the State of Maharashtra at the time of their use irrespective of the place where
the agreement for such transfer of the right to use such goods is made, and whether
the assent of the party is prior or subsequent to such transfer of the right to use any
such goods."
37. The first petitioner in the Bombay case (20th Century Finance Corporation Limited v. State of
Maharashtra [1989] 75 STC 217), as lessor entered into a Master Lease Agreement with the lessee
agreeing to give on lease certain machinery/equipment listed in the schedule subject to the terms
and conditions stipulated in the Master Lease Agreement. The agreement provided that orders for
individual equipment would be placed by the first petitioner at the instance of the lessee and the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1894003/ 14I. T. C. Classic Finance And Services vs Commissioner Of Commercial Taxes on 7 March, 1995
equipment would be despatched by the manufacturer to the location specified by the lessee. Orders
were placed by the first petitioner with the manufacturer chosen by the lessee for supply of
individual equipment which was delivered to the lessee by the supplier. After the goods were
delivered, the lessee would execute a supplementary lease schedule acknowledging due receipt of the
leased equipment. The Bombay High Court held that the right of the lessee would begin only after
acquiring physical possession of, the goods and the test of physical location of the goods at the time
of their use is relevant. Although holding that the transactions are in the nature of bailments, the
Division Bench of the Bombay High Court held that "the right to use must be deemed to arise at the
place where the goods are located at the time of their use". The Bench also expressed the view that in
case of a transfer of the right to use goods, when an agreement is made in one State for giving
delivery of goods for use by the transferee in another State, the movement precedes the transfer of
the right to use. With great respect, we are unable to agree with the reasoning of the Bombay High
Court. The propositions stated by it, in our considered view, are at variance with the two rulings of
the Supreme Court in Builders Association of India [1989] 73 STC 370 and Gannon Dunkerley & Co.
[1993] 88 STC 204. In the determination of the inter-State character of a sale, the situs is
immaterial. When goods are entrusted to a common arrier for delivery, it amounts to delivery to the
consignee and when it takes place outside the State, the fact that subsequently the goods have
reached the State where the tax is sought to be imposed, cannot be a ground for determining the tax
liability. The decision of the Bombay High Court in 20th Century Finance Corporation Limited
[1989] 75 STC 217 proceeds on the footing that a transfer of the right to use is different from sale
without considering, the fiction introduced by clause (29A) of article 566 of the Constitution.
38. The principle that where a State law while defining the expression "sale" makes the situs a
relevant consideration for the purpose of determining a deemed sale, the same cannot bring within
its ambit inter-State sales or in the course of import and export was again emphasised by. The
Supreme Court in Builders' Association of India v. State of Karnataka [1993] 88 STC 248; AIR 1993
SC 991. Interpreting Explanation (3)(a) to clause (t) of section 2 of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act,
under which, for considering the character of a deemed sale, situs is the sole determinant, the
Supreme, Court expressed the view :
"....... we are unable to hold that in fixing the situs in respect of deemed sales
resulting from transfer of property in goods involved in execution of a works contract,
the Legislature has included a sale in the course of inter-State trade or commerce or a
sale outside the State or a sale in the course of import or export."
39. For the foregoing reasons, we are of the view that the revisional order of the Commissioner of
Commercial Taxes is liable to be set aside. The learned counsel for the assessee has pressed before
us that in the event of our setting aside the order of the Commissioner, the matter must be remitted
to the original assessing authority to examine the various transactions for the purpose of
determining the liability of the assessee under section 5-E of the Act. We are not inclined to accede
to the request of the learned counsel. The order of the Appellate Deputy Commissioner was not
challenged by the assessee and it would have attained finality had it not been revised by the
Commissioner of the Commercial Taxes. It would not, therefore, be permissible for us to reopen the
entire assessment by remanding the case to the original assessing authority. The order of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1894003/ 15I. T. C. Classic Finance And Services vs Commissioner Of Commercial Taxes on 7 March, 1995
Appellate Deputy Commissioner shows that the assessee had produced evidence with regard to the
inter-State character of several transactions and accepting most of them, he had granted relief to a
considerable extent. That cannot be set at naught in this special appeal.
40. As regards the five writ petitions, our attention has not been drawn by the learned counsel for
the assessee to any particular transaction. Arguments of a general nature have been advanced for
quashing the assessments. The question decided by us in the special appeal (supra) is common to all
these five writ petitions since most of the transactions brought to tax in the writ petitions are similar
to the transactions between the assessee and M/s. Rallis India Ltd., discussed by us in the aforesaid
special appeal.
41. It is urged for the assessee that notwithstanding G.O. Ms. No. 606, Revenue (CT-II) dated July 3,
1993, rescinding G.O. Ms. No. 1388, Revenue (S) Department dated December 23, 1985, by which
exemption was granted to dealers from tax payable under section 5-E of the Act on the turnovers in
respect of any right to use goods, provided that such goods have suffered tax under the APGST Act
in the State, the assessee is not liable to pay tax under section 5-E since the earlier notification in
G.O. Ms. No. 1388 dated December 23, 1985, had extinguished tax liability which could not later be
revived unless there were fresh transactions. In other words, during the period of the currency of the
leases already entered into by the assessee, the exemption was complete. Basing upon the
representation contained in G.O. Ms. No. 1388, dated December 23, 1985, the assessee purchased
goods and hired them out which they would not have done otherwise. One other contention
advanced by Sri Anantha Babu, learned counsel, is that the intention of the Legislature in enacting
the APGST Act, as it stands now, is to subject all goods to single point tax. In respect of the goods
leased out by the assessee, no tax could be levied under section 5-E if the sales or purchases have
already suffered tax in the State.
42. Section 9 of the Act confers power on the State Government to notify exemptions and reductions
of tax or interest. It reads :
"9. Power of State Government to notify exemptions and reductions of tax (or
interest). - (1) The State Government may, by notification in the Andhra Pradesh
Gazette, make an exemption, or reduction in rate, in respect of any tax or interest
payable under this Act -
(i) on the sale or purchase of any specified class of goods, at all points or at any
specified point or points in series of sales or purchases by successive dealers; or
(ii) by any specified class of persons, in regard to the whole or any part of their
turnover.
(2) Any exemption from tax or interest or reduction in the rate of tax notified under
sub-section (1) -
(a) may extend to the whole of the State or to any specified area or areas therein;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1894003/ 16I. T. C. Classic Finance And Services vs Commissioner Of Commercial Taxes on 7 March, 1995
(b) may be subject to such restrictions and conditions as may be specified in the
notification, including conditions as to licences and licence fees."
43. G.O. Ms. No. 1388 dated December 23, 1985, reads :
"In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of section 9 of the Andhra
Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957 (Andhra Pradesh Act VI of 1957), the Governor
of Andhra Pradesh hereby exempts the dealers who transfer the right to use any
goods from the tax payable under section 5-E of the Act with effect from 1st July,
1985, on such part of the turnover in respect of any right to use goods provided that
such goods have suffered tax under the said Act in the State."
44. The exemption granted by the aforesaid notification was withdrawn by G.O. Ms. No. 606 dated
July 3, 1993, which is in the following terms :
"In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of section 9 of the Andhra
Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1957 (Act VI of 1957) read with section 15 of the
Andhra Pradesh General Clauses Act, 1891 (Act 1 of 1891), the Governor of Andhra
Pradesh hereby rescinds the notification issued in G.O. Ms. No. 1388, Revenue dated
23rd December, 1985 and published in Part I, Extraordinary of the Andhra Pradesh
Gazette dated the 24th December, 1985 and the notification issued in G.O. Ms. No.
1394, Revenue dated the 24th December, 1985 and published in Part I, extraordinary
of the Andhra Pradesh Gazette, dated the 25th December, 1985."
45. Assessment under the Act is made annually. Section 5, the charging section, enjoins every dealer
to pay a tax for each year on every rupee of his turnover of sales or purchases of goods in each year
irrespective of the quantum of his turnover at the rates of tax and at the points of levy specified in
the Schedules. Prior to the APGST (Amendment) Act, 1989 (Act 4 of 1989), multi-point tax was
levied in respect of certain goods.
46. The exemption notification in G.O. Ms. No. 1388 dated December 23, 1985, was in favour of a
specified class of persons - dealers who transfer the right to use in goods - exempting from tax
payable iffider section 5-E of the Act with effect from July 1, 1985 on such part of the turnover in
respect of any right to use goods provided that such goods have suffered tax under the said Act in
the State. The aforesaid G.O. was rescinded by the later G.O. - G.O.Ms. No. 606 dated July 3, 1993 -
which was published in the Gazette on July 7, 1993. Therefore, with effect from the date of
publication in the Gazette - July 7, 1993 - the class of persons covered by G.O.Ms. No. 1388 dated
December 23, 1985, are no longer entitled to claim exemption from tax payable under section 5-E. It
is a well-settled proposition of law, which needs no emphasis, that when power is conferred by a
legislative enactment to make rules or issue orders, that power shall he construed as including a
power exercisable in the like manner to rescind, revoke, amend or vary the rules or orders (vide
section 15 of the Andhra Pradesh General Clauses Act).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1894003/ 17I. T. C. Classic Finance And Services vs Commissioner Of Commercial Taxes on 7 March, 1995
47. We do not agree with the contention advanced for the assessee that the exemption granted shall
be in force for the currency of the leases already concluded. The principle of promissory estoppel has
no application in a case of this nature. The true test for invoking the doctrine of promissory estoppel
is :
"...... where the Government makes a promise knowing or intending, that it would be
acted on by the promisee and, in fact, the promisee acting in reliance on it, alters his
position, the Government would be held bound by the promise and the promise
would be enforceable against the Government at the instance of the promisee,
notwithstanding that there is no consideration for the promise and the promise is not
recorded in the form of a formal contract as required by article 299 of the
Constitution." (Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of Uttar Pradesh ).
48. There is no warrant for the inference that basing on the representation contained in the
exemption G.O., the assessee has acted to its detriment by purchasing the goods and leasing out the
same. No trace of evidence in this regard is placed before us.
49. The fact situation does not call for the invocation of the doctrine of legitimate expectations
which was referred to by the learned counsel for the assessee incidentally in the course of his
submissions. The decision taken by the Government to withdraw the exemption cannot be
characterised as arbitrary or unreasonable or not in the public interest, in which event alone, a
legitimate expectation of the assessee can be said to have been breached. (Union of India v.
Hindustan Development Corporation [1993] 2 SCALE 506).
50. The intention of the Government in issuing the later Notification - G.O.Ms. No. 606 dated July
3, 1993 - is very clear - to withdraw the exemption granted earlier by G.O.Ms. No. 1388 dated
December 23, 1985. In a case of this nature, what is relevant is the ascertainment of the intention of
the authority with reference to the language employed in the notification.
51. In a case where the rate of tax was reduced by a notification and subsequently, without
withdrawing that notification, the goods were brought to tax at a higher rate, it was ruled by the
Supreme Court in Commissioner, Sales Tax, U.P. v. Agra Belting Works [1987] 66 STC 1 that no
separate notification was necessary to rescind the earlier order. The court held "....... As the power
both for the grant of exemption and the variation of the rate of tax vests in the State Government
and it is not the requirement of the statute that a notification of recall of exemption is a condition
precedent to imposing tax at any prescribed rate by a valid notification under section 3A, we see no
force in the contention of the assessee which has been upheld by the High Court. In fact, the second
notification can easily be treated as a combined notification - both for withdrawal of exemption and
also for providing higher tax. When power for both the operations vests in the State and the
intention to levy the tax is clear, we see no justification for not giving effect to the second
notification."
52. Following this precedent, a Division Bench of this Court sustained the legality of a notification
issued by the Government of Andhra Pradesh in G.O.Ms. No. 561, Revenue (CT-II) dated March 26,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1894003/ 18I. T. C. Classic Finance And Services vs Commissioner Of Commercial Taxes on 7 March, 1995
1993, by which exemption granted in respect of wheat and wheat products from payment of sales tax
for a period of five years by G.O.Ms. No. 377 dated May 2, 1991, was withdrawn. (Roxy Roller Flour
Pvt. Ltd. v. Government of Andhra Pradesh [1994] 94 STC 464).
53. In the context of the discussion on the applicability of the principle of promissory estoppel, we
deem it necessary to refer to one aspect : The Division Bench of this Court in the aforesaid Roxy
Roller Flour Pvt. Ltd. [1994] 94 STC 464, while adverting to the case law on the subject, has
specifically referred to Jit Ram Shiv Kumar v. State of Haryana for the proposition that the plea of
estoppel is not available against levy of tax for augmenting the revenues. A two-Judge of Bench of
the Supreme Court in Jit Ram Shiv Kumar took a view different from the earlier view of a two-Judge
Bench of the Supreme Court in Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of Uttar Pradesh that
promissory estoppel is not available against exercise of executive functions of the State. To the
extent Jit Ram Shiv Kumar deviated from the principle laid down in Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills
Co. Ltd. , disagreement was expressed by a subsequent three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in
Union of India v. Godfrey Philips India Ltd. :
".... we are clearly of the view that what has been laid down in Motilal Padampat
Sugar Mills' case represents the correct law in regard to the doctrine of promissory
estoppel and we express our disagreement with the observations in Jeet Ram's case
[1980] 3 SCR 689, to the extent that they are in conflict with the statement of the law
in Motilal Padampat Sugar Mills' case and introduce reservations cutting down the
full width and amplitude of the propositions of law laid down in that case."
54. We, therefore, hold that G.O.Ms. No. 606 dated July 3, 1993, will have effect from the date of its
publication in the Gazette - July 7, 1993.
55. The APGST Act was amended by Act 4 of 1989, which received the assent of the Governor on
March 30, 1989. One of the purposes mentioned in the statement of objects and reasons in the
amending Act is "to replace the present multi-point levy by a single point levy". After the
amendment, there are 190 types of goods listed in Schedule I, which are taxable at the point of first
sale and one commodity - cotton yarn waste - at the point of last sale in the State. In the Second
Schedule, which covers 21 commodities, tax is leviable in respect of the same at the point of first
purchase and in respect of others, at the point of last purchase in the State. The Third Schedule
relates to declared goods taxable at single point sale or purchase. Schedule IV concerns with
exempted goods. Schedule V covers jaggery which is made liable to tax under section 5 at every
point of sale subject to the terms of the proviso in the Schedule. The effect of the proviso is to limit
the taxation to a single point purchase or sale. The Sixth Schedule relates to all liquors other than
toddy and arrack which are taxable at all sale points but on the basis of diminishing turnovers as
laid down in the proviso. In effect, this is also a single point levy.
56. The question is, if the goods leased out by the assessee had already suffered tax in the State,
either at the time of sale or purchase, whether the same can be brought to tax under section 5-E. In
view of the amendment to the expression "sale" by Act 18 of 1985 consequent upon the Constitution
(Forty-sixth Amendment) Act, the words "sale" or "purchase" of goods occurring in section 5 of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1894003/ 19I. T. C. Classic Finance And Services vs Commissioner Of Commercial Taxes on 7 March, 1995
Act, which speaks of levy of a tax on sale or purchase of goods, must be understood with reference to
the amended definition of sale as contained in Explanation IV to section 2(n) of the Act. So
construed, section S-E which speaks of levy of a tax on the amounts realised in respect of any right
to use goods, becomes relevant for the purpose of ascertainment of the rate of tax and the quantum
of turnover. The Constitution of India has chosen to treat sales and deemed sales as belonging to
one category [vide clause (29A) of article 366] and they cannot be treated separately for the purpose
of taxation after the definition of "sale" was amended by Act 18 of 1985. As the basic norm regulating
the tax structure under the Act is confined to levy of tax at a single point, levy of tax on a second sale
in respect of goods which have already suffered tax is impermissible and therefore, a deemed sale
likewise cannot be subjected to tax if the goods relatable to such deemed sale have already suffered
tax. Same goods cannot be subjected to tax twice - once as sale and secondly as deemed sale - in the
face of the legislative intent of single point taxation.
57. In the result, Special Appeal No. 1 of 1995 is allowed. The order of the Commissioner of
Commercial Taxes is set aside affirming the view of the Appellate Deputy Commissioner (CT),
Panjagutta, in Appeal No. B/57/93-94 dated April 27, 1994.
58. W.P. Nos. 12656, 12672, 12673 of 1991 and 21481 and 22349 of 1994 are allowed. The
assessment orders impugned in the writ petitions are set aside and the cases are remanded to the
original assessing authority with a direction to complete the assessments as expeditiously as
possible after issuing due notice and affording sufficient opportunity to the assessee in strict
compliance with the statutory rules and in the light of the law declared, observations made and
conclusions reached by us in this judgment. No costs.
59. Appeals and writ petitions allowed.
