HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE PURUSHAINDRA KUMAR
KAURAV
JUDGMENT
YASHWANT VARMA, J.
1. This batch of writ petitions assail the action initiated by the respondents predicated upon a
purported failure on the part of the writ petitioners to deduct tax on payments made to the Haryana
Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran1 (earlier known as the Haryana Urban Development Authority, for short
―HUDA(cid:129)) under Section 194C of the Income Tax Act, 19612. The respondents assert that the
External Development Charges3 which were paid by the writ petitioners to HSVP albeit on the
directions of the Director General, Department of Town and Country Planning4, Haryana, a
department functioning under the Government of Haryana, would clearly fall within the ambit of
Section 194C of the Act and as a consequence of default, the petitioners are liable to be proceeded
under Section 201 as also to answer why penalty be not levied in terms of Section 271C of the Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 10M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
2. We at the outset deem it appropriate to note and observe that we have heard learned counsels for
respective sides solely on the question of whether the payment of EDC would fall within the ambit of
Section 194C of the Act and whether the writ petitioners can be held liable to have deducted tax at
source in terms of that provision. We thus propose to principally answer the primary question and
consequentially leave it open for the writ petitioners as well as the respondents to proceed further in
respect of notices that may have been issued referable to HSVP The Act EDC DTCP Sections 201 and
Section 271C of the Act in accordance with the present judgment.
3. Since the questions raised were found to be common, we propose to briefly notice the salient facts
as they obtain in W.P.(C) 11232/2019 and W.P.(C) 3850/2021. It may also be noted that the facts of
each writ petition forming part of this batch and the status of individual cases has been gleaned
from a detailed chart which was placed by the respondents and forms part of the record.
4. Natureville Promoters Private Limited5 has preferred the aforenoted writ petition seeking the
following reliefs:-
―(a) Quash and set aside the CIRCULAR F. NO. 370133/37/2017 - TPL Dated
23.12.2017 (Annexure -12);
(b) Quash and set aside the Notices issued under Section 201(1)/ Section 201(1A) of
the Income Tax Act dated 22.03.2017, 31.03.2017, 10.08.2017 and 19.07.2019
[(Annexure 3, 4, 8 ( colly) and 16 ( colly)].
(c) Quash and set aside the provisions of Section 4(1), and Section 2(31)(vi) being violative of the
Article 289 of the Constitution of India imposing tax on income of State;
(d) Declare that the EDC is not leviable to Income tax, and there is no liability to deduct TDS on the
same under the Income Tax Act, 1961;
(e) Prohibit and restrain the respondents from proceeding further with the matter;
Pass such other order(s) or further orders as this Hon'ble Court deems fit and proper in the facts
and circumstances of the case, for which act of kindness the Petitioner as is duty bound shall ever
pray.(cid:129)
5. It must at the outset be noted that although a challenge to the validity of Sections 4(1), Section
2(31)(vi) of the Act also appears to form part of the writ petition, no arguments on that score were
Natureville Promoters addressed before us. RPS Infrastructure Limited6 raises a similar challenge
as would be evident from the reliefs which are sought in the petition:
―A. Issuance of writ in the nature of Certiorari, Mandamus, Prohibition or any other
appropriate writ, order or direction for quashing the impugned show cause notice
dated 12.03.2021 issued by the Respondent being illegal, arbitrary and not legally
sustainable in the eyes of law;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 11M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
B. Issuance of a writ, order and/or directions in the nature of certiorari, prohibition,
mandamus or any other appropriate writ, order or direction staying the operation of
the impugned show cause notice dated 12.03.2021 issued by the Respondent. C.
Issuance of a writ, order and/or directions in the nature of certiorari, prohibition,
mandamus or any other appropriate writ, order or direction staying all consequential
proceedings, that may be initiated pursuant to the impugned notice under challenge
issued under section 201(1)/201(1A) by the Respondent in the case of Petitioner for
FY 2013-14.
D. Grant an ad-interim ex parte stay in terms of prayers (a), (b) and
(c) above;
E. Issuance of a writ in the nature of mandamus or any other writ, order or direction, as deemed fit
and proper in the facts and circumstances of the present case.
It is further prayed that during the pendency of the present writ petition, the further proceeding
before the Respondent may kindly be stayed in the interest of justice and equity.(cid:129)
6. Natureville Promoters is stated to be engaged in the business of construction, promotion and
development of land and real estate. It was granted license no. 99 of 2010 in Form LC-V dated 30
November 2010 under the provisions of the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas
Act, 19757 for carrying out a development project in collaboration with Puri Constructions Pvt. Ltd.
It also appears to have entered into a bilateral agreement in Form LC-IV with the DTCP in RPS
Infrastructure HDRUA connection with the aforesaid project. On 22 March 2017, a notice came to
be issued by the Income Tax authorities calling upon Natureville Promoters to explain why TDS had
not been deducted on EDC payments made to HSVP. That EDC payments were made directly to
HSVP is not questioned by the writ petitioners. Their challenge essentially stems from the fact that
the said payment was made on the directions of the DTCP. Whether this aspect would have any
material bearing on their alleged liability to deduct tax is one which we propose to deal with in the
subsequent parts of this decision.
7. Reverting to the narration of facts, we note that the petitioner upon receiving the aforesaid notice
appears to have approached the office of the DTCP seeking clarifications. The DTCP was asked by
Natureville Promoters to clarify whether TDS provisions were applicable to payments made to
HSVP. The aforesaid communication was followed by a further letter addressed by the petitioner to
DTCP dated 31 July 2017 asking the concerned authority to clarify whether developers are required
to deduct TDS on EDC payments that have been made. In the meanwhile, the Income Tax
authorities issued yet another notice dated 10 August 2017 calling for further information from the
writ petitioner. The DTCP on 06 October 2017 replied to the collaborator of Natureville Promoters,
Puri Constructions, stating that EDC is a charge levied by the Government for carrying out external
development works and that the same is deposited in the receipt head of the DTCP and would thus
constitute Government receipt. It was further stated that no tax is being deducted thereon since it
was Government receipt.

8. In the meanwhile, the Central Board of Direct Taxes8 appears to have been approached by the
Finance Secretary of the Government of Haryana and called upon to clarify the position. In terms of
an Office Memorandum9 dated 23 December 2017, the CBDT took the following position:-
―F. No.370133/372017-TPL Government of India Ministry of Finance Department of
Revenue (Central Board of Direct Taxes) TPL Division ******* New Delhi, 23rd
December, 2017 OFFICE MEMORANDUM Sub: Recommendations for relief from
applicability of TDS provisions on External Development Charges (EDC) payable to
Directorate of Town & Country Planning (DTCP) State Government of
Haryana-regarding.
Kindly refer to your letter dated 21st November, 2017 addressed to the Finance
Secretary, along with the enclosures on the captioned subject.
2. In this regard it is submitted that provisions of non-deduction of tax under Section
196 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, is applicable to the Government and to the other
authorities as mentioned under the Section. Accordingly, External Development
Charges (EDC) if paid to Government of Haryana would be exempt from TDS
provisions. However, in the instant case, it appears that the developer has made the
payment in the nature of External Development Charges (EDC) not to the
Government but to HUDA [Haryana Urban Development Authority) which is a
development authority of State Government of Haryana and is a taxable entity under
the income-tax Act, 1961. Hence, TDS provisions would be applicable on EDC
payable by the developer to HUDA
3. It may be mentioned here that section 194 of the Income as Act, 1961 provides for
non- deduction of tax in suitable cases. The CBDT OM HUDA may resort to aforesaid
provision for exemption of TDS with regard to payment of EDC
4. This issues with the approval of Finance Secretary.

9. Insofar as the DTCP is concerned, it vide its communication of 19 June 2018 while clarifying the
position with respect to HSVP took the following stand:-
―DIRECTORATE OF TOWN & COUNTRY PLANNING HARYANA SCO No. 71-75,

19.06.2018 Subject: Clarification on TDS Deductions on EDC Payments.
Please refer to the matter cited as subject above.
1. Section 2(g) of the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act, 1975 defines that
external development works (hereinafter referred as EDW) shall includes any or all infrastructure
development works like water supply, sewerage, drains, provisions of treatment and disposal of
sewage, sullage and storm water, roads, electrical works, solid complex, fire stations, grid
sub-stations etc and/or any other work which the Director may specify to be executed in the
periphery of or outside colony/area for the benefit of the colony/area.
2. As per Section 3(3)(ii), license holder has to pay proportionate development charges if the
external development works as defined in clause (g) of section 2 are to be carried out by the
Government or any other local authority. The proportion in which and the time within which, such
payment is to be made, shall be determined by the Director.
3. Presently, external development works in the periphery of or outside colony/area for the benefit
of the colony/area are being executed by Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (hereafter HSVP) which
is the Development Authority of State govt. Earlier upto 31.03.2017, Department of Town & Country
Planning used to collect the external development charges from the colonizer to whom licences have
been granted under Act No.8 of 1975 and the persons to whom permission for change of Land use
have been granted under Act No. 41 of 1963, in the shape of bank draft drawn in favour of CA, HSVP
and sent the same to CA, HSVP.
4. As the receipt on account of EDC was not sufficient to carry out the all development works under
EDC for the urban estate as per approved development plans, therefore, to meet out the shortfall, a
new scheme Swaran Jayanti Haryana Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme (renamed as
Mangal Nagar Vikas Yojana was approved by the State Govt. and appropriate budget provision for
execution of development works has been made in the said scheme. From Financial Year 2017-18,
the receipts on account of EDC is being deposited in the consolidated fund of the State under Major
Receipt Head 0217 receipts and all license / CLU holders have also been directed vide order dated
12.05.2017 that payment of EDC in respect of license/ CLU granted by TCP Deptt. May be made
online through e-payment gateway or in shape of demand drafts favouring Director, Town &
Country Planning, Haryana. Required funds for execution of development works are released to
HSVP after granting the sanction from the Finance Department.
It is, therefore, clarified that HSVP is only an executing agency working for and on behalf of State
Govt. for carrying out EDW for which funds are given to HSVP by the Govt. through TCP Deptt.
Since, payment for EDC has been made to TCP Deptt. Of State Govt., no TDS was/is to be deducted
out of payment made to Govt. for EDW.

10. In the meanwhile and taking note of the controversy which had arisen, DLF Utilities Limited, is
stated to have approached the Punjab and Haryana High Court by way of CWP No. 1866/2018.
While entertaining that writ petition, the High Court on 29 January 2018 passed the following
interim order:-
―Issue notice of motion returnable on 27.03.2017.
One of the questions that arises is whether the petitioner is at all liable to deduct tax
at source. This in turn raises a question as to whether the external development
charges are payable by the petitioner under the Haryana Development and
Regulation of Urban Areas Act, 1975 to the Government of Haryana or to any other
party. If it is to the Government of Haryana, it is possible that the exemption under
Section 196 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 would apply.
The petitioner states it entered into the agreements in Forms IV and LC-IV A. Prima
facie, the agreements are with the Governor of Haryana.
In these circumstances, petitioner shall pursuant to the impugned notice dated
22.01.2018 appear before the officer. Till further orders, the order, if any, however,
shall not be given effect to.(cid:129)
11. Writ petitions thereafter came to be filed before this Court including W.P. (C) 9483/2019 by the
collaborator of Natureville Promoters and where upon taking note of the orders passed by the
Punjab and Haryana High Court in DLF Utilities Limited, interim orders were passed providing that
while proceedings may go on, any orders adverse to the petitioner, if passed, would not be given
effect to. Similar orders operate on the various writ petitions forming part of this batch. It is this
interim order which has continued on all the writ petitions forming part of this batch.
12. The sequence of events insofar as RPS Infrastructure is concerned follow a similar chronology. A
notice under Section 201 and Section 201(1A) of the Act came to be issued against that writ
petitioner on 16 December 2020. The charge in that notice was identical to that laid against
Natureville Promoters, namely, the liability to deduct tax on EDC payments made to HSVP.
13. Responding to the aforesaid notice, RSP Infrastructure took the position that TDS was not liable
to be deducted and prayed for the proceedings being dropped. Ultimately and by an order dated 12
March 2021, the Income Tax Department issued a final notice holding that HSVP was a taxable
entity and consequently there was an evident failure on the part of RSP Infrastructure to deduct tax
in accordance with the provisions made in Chapter XVII-B of the Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 15M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
14. It becomes pertinent to note that the present litigation stems from the stand taken by the Income
Tax Department that tax was liable to be deducted by virtue of the provisions made in Section 194C.
It would further appear from the record that earlier also notices under Section 148 of the Act and
based on a failure to deduct tax in respect of EDC payments had been issued against various entities
and at which stage the respondents had taken the position that tax was liable to be deducted under
Section 194 of the Act. One of those notices came to be challenged in BPTP Limited v. Principal
Commissioner of Income Tax (Central) - III & Anr.10 The Court in BPTP upheld that challenge
holding that no liability to deduct tax under Section 194 or 194I would (2020) 421 ITR 59 arise. We
deem it apposite to extract the following passages from BPTP:-
―26. The Assessing Officer in paragraph 2 of the recorded reasons quotes that
"External development charges is covered by the provisions of section 194 of the
Income-tax Act, 1961. The assessee has failed to deduct tax at source on the payments
made to the Haryana Urban Development Authority". There is no explanation or
rationale for the aforesaid observation made by the Assessing Officer. We, therefore,
cannot understand as to how the payment of external development charges being in
the nature of statutory fees, could be subject to withholding tax under section 194 of
the Act, a provision that is applicable to dividends. The nature of dividend payment is
intrinsically different from external development charges and, therefore, the
apparent reason for reopening seems to be erroneous, irrational and fallacious. The
subsequent observation in paragraph 2 "as per the provisions of section 40(a)(ia) of
the Income-tax Act, any sum payable on which tax is deductible at source under
Chapter XVII-B but the same has not been deducted" appears to be based on the
understanding that the provisions of section 194 are attracted to external
development charges and, therefore, it is subject to withholding tax and consequently
the provisions of section 40(a)(ia) of the Act would be attracted. Even if one were to
ignore the provision of law quoted and relied upon by the Assessing Officer, and we
were to agree with the contention of Revenue that while exercising the power, the
source may not be specifically referred to or if wrongly mentioned to, it would not
render the exercise of such power to be invalid, yet, we are unable to fathom as to
how the Assessing Officer has arrived at the conclusion that the external development
charges payment was subject to tax deduction at source. The Revenue in its
counter-affidavit has sought to elaborate on the aforesaid reasons by contending that
the external development charges payment is akin to rent.
However, we are not impressed with this submission. Firstly, such an understanding is not borne
out from the recorded reasons and, secondly, the Department cannot by way of a counter-affidavit
supplement the recorded reasons by introducing such legal submissions. The source of the power in
this case, as sought to be argued, is not discernible.
27. If the Assessing Officer harboured a reason to believe that the payment of external development
charges requires deduction of tax at source under the provisions of the Income-tax Act, it ought to
have disclosed the basis for such a view. The entire reasoning disclosed in the recorded reasons, for
initiating the proceedings is completely silent on this aspect. It merely states that "Since, external
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 16M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
development charges has income character, therefore it should have been subjected to tax deducted
at source by assessee". The Assessing Officer has further proceeded to observe since the assessee is a
development authority of State Government of Haryana and is a taxable entity, deduction of tax at
source provisions could be applicable on external development charges payable by the assessee
through Haryana Urban Development Authority. Apart from making aforenoted observations and
referring to section 194 and section 40(a)(ia), there is no apparent rationale for assumption of
jurisdiction by the Assessing Officer. The judgment in Greater Mohali Area (supra) is of no
assistance to the Revenue as the same is distinguishable on facts. In the said case, the petitioner who
was recipient of external development charges had approached the court seeking quashing of the
order disposing of its objections to the reasons recorded for reopening the assessment under
sections 147 and 148 of the Act. In the assessment under section 143 (3) of the Act, the effect of
external development charges upon petitioner's income was not referred to, the Assessing Officer
sought to reopen the assessment on the basis of reason to believe that income on account of external
development charges had escaped assessment. In these circumstances, since, the assessment order,
did not deal with the character of the income of external development charges or its effect on
petitioner's income, the court upheld the action of reopening on the ground that the issue had not
been considered at the time of the assessment. Likewise, the other judgment relied upon by the
Revenue in the case of New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (supra) is also distinct on facts.
In the said case, the court was examining as to whether Greater Noida and Noida Authorities were
local authorities within the meaning of section 10(20) of the Income-tax Act and whether their
income was exempt from Income-tax. Deciding this question, the court held that the Noida and
Greater Noida are not local authorities for the purpose of the Act. Therefore, the aforesaid decision
has no relevance to the facts of the present case.
28. We would also like to reflect on section 194-1 and its Explanation which deals with rent and has
been relied upon by the Revenue to contend that the definition of "rent" is broad and would also
envisage the payment of external development charges and is subject to withholding tax. In support
of this provision, the Revenue has relied upon the observations of the Supreme Court in New Okhla
Industrial Development Authority (No. 2) v. CIT (Appeals) (2018) 406 ITR 209 (SC), the relevant
portion whereof is reproduced herein below (page 218 of 406 ITR):
"The definition of rent as contained in the Explanation is a very wide definition. The
Explanation states that 'rent' means any payment, by whatever name called, under
any lease, sub-lease, tenancy or any other agreement or arrangement for the use of
any land. The High Court has read the relevant clauses of the lease deed and has
rightly come to the conclusion that payment which is to be made as annual rent is
rent within the meaning of section 194-1, we do not find any infirmity in the aforesaid
conclusion of the High Court. The High Court has rightly held that tax deducted at
source shall be deducted on the payment of the lease rent to the Greater Noida as per
section 194-1. Reliance on circular dated January 30, 1995 has been placed by the
Noida/Greater Noida. A perusal of the circular dated January 30, 1995 indicate that
the query which has been answered in the above circular is 'Whether requirement of
deduction of Income-tax at source under section 194-1 applies in case of payment by
way of rent to the Government, statutory authorities referred to in section 10(20A)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 17M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
and local authorities whose income under the head 'Income from house property' or
'Income from other sources' is exempt from Income-tax."
29. We are unable to see as to how the above provision and decision is of any assistance to the
Revenue. It can be seen from the quoted portion of the said judgment that in the said case, the
payment of annual rent was considered to be falling within the ambit of section 194 -I , a conclusion
drawn by the court on a reading of the relevant clauses of the lease deed. In the present case, the
external development charges, on the aforesaid rationality, cannot be subjected to section 194-1 of
the Act. Moreover, if such was the understanding of the Revenue, it should have been well founded
and disclosed in the reasons recorded by the Assessing Officer. Deduction of tax at source is dealt
with under Chapter XVII of the Income- tax Act. The provisions enumerated thereunder, stipulate
requirement of deduction of tax at source. The Revenue is unable to point out any specific provision
which deals with external development charges payment except for alluding to section 194-1. We
need not delve into this question any further as we do not find this to be a ground spelt out in the
reasons for reopening the assessment under section 147 of the Act. The statutory orders containing
reasons have to be judged on the basis of what is apparent and not what is explained later. The
Revenue cannot be permitted to improve the same by offering better explanation during the course
of the proceedings. On this issue we would like to refer the view of the Supreme Court in Mohinder
Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner (1978) 1 SCC 405 where it has been held "The second
equally relevant matter is that when a statutory functionary makes an order based on certain
grounds, its validity must be judged by the reasons so mentioned and cannot be supplemented by
fresh reasons in the shape of affidavit or otherwise.(cid:129)
15. Yet another challenge thereafter came to be laid before this Court in DLF Homes Panchkula Pvt.
Ltd. vs. Joint Commissioner of Income Tax11 with the respondents this time taking the position that
TDS on EDC was liable to be deducted by virtue of Section 194I. This stand came to be negatived
with our Court holding that EDC could not be termed as „rent(cid:131) so as to fall within the ambit of
Section 194I.
16. The writ petitioners have also referred to the views expressed by different benches of the Income
Tax Appellate Tribunal12 while dealing with penalty proceedings. However, insofar as RPS
Infrastructure is concerned, it appears to have been placed on notice with respect to a levy of penalty
under Section 271C for Financial Years13 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. While dealing with the
aforesaid issue the Additional Commissioner of Income Tax in terms of an order made on 15
January 2018 took the following stand:-
―4.1. HUDA was constituted under Haryana Urban Development Authority Act, 1977.
The functions of HUDA are:
a. To promote and secure development of urban areas with the power to acquire. sell
and dispose off property, both movable and immovable.

4.2 Basis/Rationale for charging of EDC by HUDA-
4.2. 1 External Development Work (hereafter EDW) is defined in the Haryana Development and
Regulation of Urban Area Act. 1975 (hereafter HDRUA). Definition of EDW is given in section 2(g)
of this Act It is as follows:
'External Development works include water supply. sewerage, drains. necessary
provisions of treatment and disposal of sewage, sullage and storm water, roads,
electrical works. solid waste management and disposal slaughter houses, colleges,
hospitals, stadium/sports complex. fire stations grid sub-stations etc and any other
work which the directory may specify to the executed in the periphery of or outside
colony/area for the benefit of the colony/area' 4.2.2 HUDA charges EDC as per
section 3(3)(a)(ii) of HDRUA, which reads as under:
‗To pay proportionate development charges if the external development works as
defined in clause (g) of Section 2 are to be carried out by the Government or any
other local authority The proportion in which and the time within which such
payment is to be made, shall be determined by the Director' 4.2.3 HUDA charges
EDC for EDWs by issuing letters/circulars which are documented from time to time:
Sr. Subject/ Dispatch Date of Issue
No. Description No.
a Fixation of 22860-72 14.08.2002

in cases of released land
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 20M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
4.2.4 The gist of these letters/circulars is that EDC are levied as per Section 2(g) for
EDW on the beneficiaries to whom the change of land use permission is granted for
various purposes in the Agricultural/Rural Zone and who are also availing the
benefits of the EDW like the town level facilities of major circulation roads, stadiums,
hospitals colleges, crematoriums town parks etc. being provided by HUDA in the
nearby urbanisable areas. Since the change of land use holders avail the parts of the
EDW, they should also proportionately contribute towards the expenditure incurred
on EDW by HUDA This proportionate contribution is called EDC.
4.2.5 The rationale for EDC received/charged by HUDA is further strengthened by a
noteworthy point Mentioned in the 'Notes to The Accounts Forming Part of The
Balance Sheet As on 31. 03 2016' having significant bearing on the nature EDC is as
under:
2 (ii) other liabilities also include external developmental charges received through
DGTCP department Haryana for execution of various EDC works. The expenditure
against which have been booked Development Work in Progress, Enhancement
compensation and Land cost.' 4.3 Determination of EDC to be paid by participating
private persons/builders, colonizers etc.-
4.3.1 A participating private builder is required to pay EDC as provided in the license
for setting up a commercial colony on urbanisable land held by it in vicinity of land
owned and developed (EDWs) by HUDA The license is issued by the Directorate of
Town and Country Planning, Haryana, subject to the undertaking as per the relevant
conditions mention below:
To submit an undertaking to the effect that you shall make arrangement for water
supply, sewerage, drainage ere to the satisfaction of DGTCP till these services are
made available from external infrastructure to be laid by HUDA "
4.3.2 Computation of External Development Charges (EDC) is made as under:
A) Charges for Commercial area =Rs. X Lakhs (@ Rs. Y lakhs/Acre) B) Total cost of
Development = Rs. X Lakhs C) 25% bank guarantee required = Rs. 0.25 X Lakhs
iv) The demand drafts of EDC amounts are drawn in favour of the Chief
Administrator, HUDA though routed through the Director General Town and
Country Planning, Sector 18, Chandigarh. This state of affairs as for as the EDC is
concerned is stated by HUDA in the 'Notes to The Accounts Forming Part of The
Balance Sheet As on 31.03.2016' filed with the return of income. It reads as under:
―2(i) Other liabilities also include external developmental charges received through
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 21M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
DGTCP Department Haryana for execution of various EDC works. The expenditure
against whtch have been booked in Development Work in Progress. Enhancement
compensation and Land cost.
(iv) This establish the fact that the land is owned and developed by HUDA which
receives EDC as return/income on the money invested in the EDWs. There is specific
quid pro quo for EDC.
EDC would never be returnable and would never be returned because it is a consideration paid by
EDW users.
4. 3.3 EDC is worked out for a particular urban estate on the basis of the cost of external
development services such as master water supply. Master Sewage, Master Roaos, Master Storm
Water Drainage, Master Horticulture. Master Community building and other services is determined
on the basis of a price index of a particular year in respect of a particular urban estate. The cost is
determined by the Engineering Wing of HUDA keeping in view the requirement of development
plan of an urban estate. EDC is charged from sectors floated by HUDA or the license granted by the
Town & Country Planning Department to the developers. To say that there is no element of profit in
EDC because EDC varies depending upon requirement of development in each urban estate.
Therefore it is in the nature of liabilities is incorrect because the payers of EDC are allowed to use
EDWs for payment of fees worked out On the basis of investments in EDWs. EDC is charged from
colonizers for using the developed urban infrastructure in urban estates wherein they are allowed to
establish their commercial set ups The EDC IS a usar fee charged by HUDA from colonizers.
4.3.4 The 1ncome nature of EDC would not change even though it is received through DGTCP
department Haryana The method of accounting of payment EDC by private colonizer like M/s. XYZ
Pvt. Ltd. in its books of accounts as Current assets would also not change the income nature of EDC
in the hands of HUDA.
4.3.5 Showng EDC as current liability by HUDA is incorrect for the reasons narrated in the
foregoing paras, based on specific nature and flow of transactions, supported by specific evidences
in form of sample letters/documents, Therefore. EDC is a revenue receipt having character of
income of HUOA. This is also a finding of assessing officer of HUDA which stands confirmed by
CIT(A) too. Therefore, ought to have been subjected to TDS by payer of EDC.
4.4 Reasons for Applicability of TDS provisions on EDC paid to HUDA:
i) HUDA is a taxable entity carrying out business activities to acquire, develop and
dispose off land for residential, industrial, commercial and institutional purposes in
urban estates so developed in state of Haryana its business income is taxed by
1ncome tax department which includes EDC.
ii) In the Circular No. 681 dated 8.3.94 issued by the CBDT it has been stated that a
work done by one person is service rendered to another. One of the dictionary
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 22M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
meanings of the word 'service· is work {Associate Cement Co. Ltd. Vs. CIT, 120 ITR
444 (Patna)].
The Circular at para (v) states that the ·service contract would be covered by the provisions of this
section since service means doing any work. It further states at para (i) that 'the provisions of
section 194C shall apply to all types of contracts for carrying out any work including transport
contracts, service contracts. "
The relevant port1on of Circular No. 681 of CBDT dated 8/3/94 is as under:
" ..... ....... 3. Section 194C was introduced with effect from 1st April, 1972. Shortly
after its introduction, the Board Issued Circulars No. 86, dated 29th May, 1972 (F.No.
275/9/72-ITJ), No. 93, dated 26 September, 1972 (F.No. 275/100/72-ITJ), and No.
108, dated 20 March, 1973 (F.No. 131(9)/73- TPL), in this regard.
4. Some of the issues raised in the above-mentioned circulars need to be reviewed in
the light of the judgment dated March 23, 1993, delivered by the Supreme Court of
India in Civil Appeal No. 2860(NT) of 1979· Associated Cement Co. Ltd. Vs.
CIT1993] 201 ITR 435.
5. The Supreme Court has held that " ... there is nothing in the sub-.section which
could make us hold that the contract to carry out a work or the contract to supply
labour to carry out a work should be confined to 'works contract'.... Their Lordships
have further held that 'Any work' means; any work and not a 'work contract', which
has a special connotation in the tax law ... 'Work' envisaged in the sub-section,
therefore, has a wide import and covers 'any work' which one or the other of the
organizations specified ln the sub-section can get carried out through a contractor
under a contract and further it includes obtaining by any of such organizations
supply of labour under a contact with a contractor for carrying out its work which
would have fallen outside the 'work' but for its specific inclusion in the sub-section."
6. It may be pointed out that this appeal before the Supreme Court was by virtue of a special leave
petition against the judgment in Writ Petition No. 2909 of 1978 of the Patna High Court in the case
of Associated Cement Co. Ltd. Vs. CIT [1979} 120 ITR 444. The Patna High Court, while dismissing
the writ petition of the aforesaid company, observed that "In a very broad sense, a work done by one
person is service rendered to another and indeed one of the dictionary meanings of the word
'service' is work".
7. The conclusion flowing from the aforesaid judgments of the supreme Court and the Patna High
Court is that the provisions of section 194C would apply to all types of contracts including transport
contacts, labour contracts, service contracts, etc. In the light of these judgments, the Board have
decided to withdraw their above mentioned Circulars Nos. 86 and 93 and para 11 of Circular No 108
and issue the following guidelines in regard to the applicability of the provisions of section 194C:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 23M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
(i) The provisions of section 194C shall apply to all types of contracts for carrying out
any work including transport contracts, service contracts, advertisement contracts,
broadcasting contracts.
Telecasting contracts, labour contracts, materials contracts and works contracts ...... "
4.5 Payments received as EDC are for EDWs like water supply, sewerage, drains,
necessary provisions of treatment and disposal of sewage, sullage and storm water,
roads, electrical works, solid waste management and disposal slaughter houses
colleges. Hospitals, stadium/sports complex, fire stations, grid sub-stations etc. and
any other work which the Director may specify to the executed in the periphery of or
outside colony/area for the benefit of the colony/area.
4.6 EDC is worked out for a particular urban estate on the basis of the cost of external
development services such as Master Water Supply, Master Sewage, Master Roads.
Master Storm Water Drainage Master Horticulture. Master Community building and
other services is determined on the basis of a price index of a particular year in
respect of a particular urban estate. The cost is determined by the Engineering Wing
of HUDA keeping in view the requirement of development plan of an urban estate.
EDC is charged from the sectors floated by HUDA or the license granted by the Town
& Country Planning Department to the developers. EDC is charged from colonizers
for using the developed urban infrastructure in urban estates wherein they are
allowed to establish their commercial set ups. The EDC is arising out of an agreement
which is in the nature of service contract wherein colonizers pay EDC to HUDA is
rendering a service to colonizers for which EDC is paid EDC is charged for
development work received by HUOA from private builders and the work carried out
is civil work in nature for providing amenities. The work is for creating/maintaining
and strengthening of infrastructure created for urban areas in order to make it
suitable for urban habitations. EOWs enhance value of property and the value
additions fetch higher price from prospective customers. Thus EDC payments made
by the builders to HUDA are covered under service contract Therefore, a private
builder is liable to deduct tax at source on such payments under the provisions of
Section 194C of Income tax Act Hence EDC ought be subjected to TDS by payers @ 2
% u/s 194C of the Income tax Act.(cid:129)
17. RPS Infrastructure challenged the aforesaid order before the Tribunal and which
by its order of 23 July 2019 ultimately allowed the appeals holding that there was
reasonable cause underlying failure on the part of RPS Infrastructure to deduct TDS
and in the absence of any contumacious conduct, the penalty was liable to be deleted.
18. Mr. Jain, who led submissions on behalf of RPS Infrastructure Ltd. took us in
great detail through the relevant provisions of the HDRUA. He referred firstly to the

20. The principal submission of Mr. Jain was that there exists no privity of contract between the
petitioners and HSVP. According to learned counsel, a reading of the aforesaid provisions would
clearly establish that the application for permission and for development is examined and evaluated
only by the DTCP and that the HDRUA does not contemplate any intervention or involvement of the
HSVP. According to learned counsel even the power to cancel a license for development which may
have been granted vests solely with the Director as would be evident from Section 8 of the Act. That
provision reads thus:-
―8. Cancellation of license.-- (1) A license granted under this Act, shall be liable to be
cancelled by the Director if the colonizer contravenes any of the conditions of the
license or the provisions of the Act or the rules made thereunder; provided that
before such cancellation the coloniser shall be given an opportunity of being heard.
[(2) After cancellation of the licence, the Director may himself, carry out or cause to
be carried out, the development works in the colony and recover such charges as the
Director may have to incur on the said development works from the colonizer and the
plot-holders in the manner prescribed as arrears of land revenue. (3) The liability of
the colonizer for payment of such charges shall not exceed the amount the colonizer
has actually recovered from the plot-holders less the amount actually spent on such
developments works, and that of the plot-holders shall not exceed the amount which
they would have to pay to the colonizer towards the expenses of the said development
works under the terms of the agreement of sale or transfer entered into between
them:
Provided that Director may, recover from the plot holders with their consent, an
amount in excess of what may be admissible under the aforesaid terms of agreement
of sale or transfer. (4) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act after the
colony has been fully developed under sub-section (2), the Director may, with a view
to enabling the colonizer, to transfer the possession of and the title to the land to the
plot-holders within a specified time, authorize the colonizer by an order to receive the
balance amount, if any, due from the plot holders, after adjustment of the amount
which may have been recovered by the Director towards the cost of the development
works and also transfer the possession of or the title to the land to the plot-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 32M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
holder within aforesaid time. If the colonizer fails to do so, the Director shall on behalf of the
colonizer transfer the possession of and the title to the land to the plot-holders on receipt of the
amount which was due from them.
(5) After meeting the expenses on development works under sub- section (2), the balance amount
shall be payable to the colonizer.(cid:129)
21. Mr. Jain further underlined the fact that even the imposition of penalties is a subject which is
regulated by the Director in the office of the DTCP. He in this regard drew our attention to Section
10 of the HDRUA which is reproduced hereinbelow:-
―10. Penalties.-- (1) Any person who contravenes any of the provisions of this Act or
the rules made thereunder or any of the conditions of a licence granted under section
3 shall be punishable with imprisonment of either description for a term which may
extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine:
Provided that where only of the provisions of section 9 are contravened the
punishment of imprisonment shall not exceed six months. 84[(2) Without prejudice
to the provisions of sub-section (1), the Director or any other officer authorized in
writing by him in this behalf may, by notice, served by post and if a person avoids
service, or is not available for service of notice, or refuses to accept service, then by
affixing a copy of it on the outer door or some other conspicuous part of such
premises, or in such other manner as may be prescribed, call upon any person who
has committed a breach of the provisions referred to in the said sub-
section to stop further construction and to appear and show cause why he should not be ordered to
restore to its original state or to bring it in conformity with the provisions of this Act or the rules
framed thereunder, as the case may be, any building or land in respect of which a contravention
such as is described in the said subsection has been committed and if such person fails to show
cause to the satisfaction of the Director or such authorized officer within a period of seven days, the
Director or such authorized officer may pass an order requiring him to restore such land or building
to its original state or to bring it in conformity with the provisions of this Act or the rules framed
there-under, as the case may be, within a further period of seven day.
(3) If the order made under sub-section (2) is not carried out within a specified period, the Director,
or any other officer authorized in writing by him in this behalf may, himself at the expiry of the
specified period, take such measures, as may appear necessary to give effect to the order and the
cost of such measure shall, if effect to the order and the cost of such measure shall, if not paid on
demand being made to him, be recoverable from such person as arrears of land revenue:
Provided that even before the expiry of the period mentioned in the order under
subsection (2), if the Director or such authorized officer is satisfied that instead of
stopping the construction, the person continues with the contravention, the Director
or such authorized officer may himself take such measures, as may appear necessary,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 33M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
to give effect to the order and the cost of such measures shall if not paid on demand
being made to him, be recoverable from such person as arrears of land revenue.]"

23. The submission essentially was that the application for development is examined and regulated
solely by the office of the DTCP and nowhere contemplates the involvement of HSVP. It was
submitted that the bilateral agreements, templates of which are embodied in Forms LC IV-A and LC
IV-B, would also indicate that the agreement is essentially between the owner/developer on the one
hand and the Director, DTCP on the other. It was his submission that this supports the contention of
the writ petitioner that the contractual arrangement is only between the owner/developer and
DTCP. Our attention was also drawn to Form LC IV-D as appended to the Rules and which
incorporates the following provisions:-

2. Provided always and it is hereby agreed that if the owner commits any breach of the terms and
conditions of this bilateral agreement or violate any provisions of the Act or the Rules, then and in
any such cases notwithstanding the waiver of any previous clause or right, the Director, may cancel
the licence granted to the owner.
3. Upon cancellation of the licence under clause2 above, action shall be taken as provided in the
Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act, 1975 and the Haryana Development and

4. The Stamp duty and registration charges on this deed shall be borne by the owner.
5. After the layout plans and development in respect of the commercial colony have been completed

to 1/5th amount thereof shall be kept unreleased to ensure upkeep and maintenance of the colony

case the owner is relieved of the responsibility in this behalf by the Government. However, the bank
guarantee regarding the external development charges shall be released by the Director in
proportion to the payment of the external development charges received from the owner.
6. That any other condition which the Director may think necessary in public interest can be
imposed.(cid:129)
24. It was submitted by Mr. Jain that although the aforesaid bilateral agreement requires EDC
payment being made over to HSVP, the said agreement itself indicates that it is a payment which is
liable to be routed through the DTCP. According to learned counsel, this aspect reinforces the stand
of the petitioners of a contractual relationship existing only between the owner/developer and
DTCP. According to learned counsel, since all aspects relating to the proposed development and the
carrying out of external development under the HDRUA and the HDRUA Rules is regulated by the
DTCP and the payment to HSVP is merely routed through that department of the Government of
Haryana, the invocation of Section 194C is clearly misconceived.
25. It was then submitted that EDC is liable to be acknowledged as being a statutory levy since in
case of a default in payment thereof, it is open to the DTCP to recover the same as areas of land
revenue. Our attention in this respect was drawn to Section 10A of the HDRUA which reads as
follows:-
―10A. Recovery of dues.--All dues payable under the Act, which have not been
deposited within the time specified, shall be recovered as arrears of land revenue.(cid:129)
26. According to learned counsel since EDC is a payment which is imbued with statutory character,
no tax is liable to be deducted thereon. Mr. Jain relied upon the following observations as appearing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 42M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
in the decision of the Calcutta High Court in Star Paper Mills Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Income
Tax15:
―14. Now it brings us to the issue whether the royalty payable by the assessee in
pursuance of the order dated April 30, 1979, is a statutory liability. To consider this
issue first we would like to refer to some observations, decisions, relevant to the
issue.
15. In the case of CIT v. Gorelal Dubey, [1998] 232 ITR 246 the issue before the
Madhya Pradesh High Court was whether royalty is a tax. Following the decision of
their Lordships in India 2001 SCC OnLine Cal 851 Cement Ltd. v. State of Tamil
Nadu, [1991] 188 ITR 690 (SC), the Madhya Pradesh High Court has taken the view
that royalty is a tax.
The Madhya Pradesh High Court has observed at page 248 as under:
―In paragraph 31 (at page 707 of 188 ITR) of the judgment, their Lordships, after
referring to the views expressed by the Rajasthan, Punjab, Gujarat and Orissa High
Courts that the royalty cannot be said to be a tax because this is something which is
being paid in lieu of minerals extracted, in paragraph 34 (at page 707 of 188 ITR),
concluded by saying that the royalty is a tax and thus the decisions of the High Courts
cannot hold good.(cid:129)
16. When the royalty is treated as a tax that cannot be a contractual liability. The view
taken by the Madhya Pradesh High Court in Gorelal's case, [1998] 232 ITR 246 has
been affirmed by their Lordships of the Supreme Court reported in Gorelal Dubey v.
CIT, [2001] 248 ITR 3. Their Lordships in para. 3 observed that the Constitution
Bench judgment in India Cement Ltd.'s case, [1991] 188 ITR 690 lays down the law,
namely, that royalty is tax, and it is a tax for all purposes including section 43B of the
Income-tax Act, 1961.
17. While considering the provisions of sections 82 and 83 of the Forest Act, the
Madhya Pradesh High Court has held in the case of Dulichand Agarwal v. State of
M.P., [1980] MPLJ 465, that section 82 of the Forest Act as substituted by the
Madhya Pradesh Act No. 9 of 1965 creates a statutory liability for recovery of the
amount payable to the Government under terms of a notice relating to the sale of
forest produce by auction. The statutory liability can be enforced even though there is
no contract as envisaged under article 299 of the Constitution of India. The relevant
discussion whether section 82 creates a statutory liability the court has discussed at
page 470. The relevant observations read as under:
―It was argued by learned counsel for the petitioner that section 82 does not create a
new liability and that is only provides for a procedure for enforcing a liability and that
in the absence of any contract in the manner provided in article 299(1) there could be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 43M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
no liability to pay the deficiency. In our opinion, this argument cannot be accepted.
Section 82 properly construed creates a statutory liability for recovery of the amount
payable to the Government under the terms of a notice relating to the sale of forest
produce by auction. This statutory liability can be enforced even though there is no
contract as envisaged under article 299 of the Constitution. This construction of
section 82 is strongly supported by the decision of the Supreme Court in A.
Damodaran v. State of Kerala, (1976) 3 SCC 61 : AIR 1976 SC 1533.(cid:129)
18. Now the question is when the Madhya Pradesh High Court has taken a view that
section 82 of the Forest Act creates a statutory liability and their Lordships of the
Supreme Court have taken the view in the case of Gorelal, [2001] 248 ITR 3 that
royalty is a tax, how it can be said that royalty liability is not a statutory liability.
19. Once a particular status is conferred to the nature of liability that cannot be
changed unless otherwise warranted under the provisions of the Act. In the case of
contractual liability, if the liability is disputed that cannot be recovered as land
revenue or to enforce the terms of the agreement, for that one has to approach the
court. If it is a statutory liability like royalty in this case that royalty liability which is
fixed by the Government can be recovered as land revenue without approaching the
court.(cid:129) In view of the above, according to Mr. Jain, the payment of EDC is liable to be
viewed as a payment to the Government of Haryana itself and consequently being
exempted in terms of Section 196 of the Act.
27. While reiterating the submissions addressed by Mr. Jain, Mr. Agarwal appearing in Natureville
Promoters additionally addressed the following submissions. It was firstly contended that Section
196 of the Act is liable to be read alongside Article 289 of the Constitution and thus the Court
declaring that payments made to HSVP would clearly be exempt from TDS. Mr. Agarwal took us
through the LC- I, II, III, IV, IV-D and V formats and submitted that the application by a developer
is made to the DTCP and which is the solitary authority empowered to either accept or refuse the
grant of a licence. It was further submitted that once the DTCP comes to form a provisional opinion
that a grant of licence would be merited, it calls upon the owner to fulfil various conditions laid
down in Rule 11. Rule 11 is extracted hereinbelow:
―11. Conditions required to be fulfilled by applicant [Section 3(3)]-- (1) the applicant
shall:--
(a) furnish to the Director either a bank guarantee equal to twenty-five percent of the
estimated cost of the development works or mortgage a part of the licenced land, as
determined by the Director and enter into an agreement in form LC-IV for carrying
out and completion of development works in accordance with the licence finally
granted:
Provided that in case of affordable plotted residential colony under Deen Dayal Jan
Awas Yojana, the coloniser shall have option to deposit the cost of internal
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 44M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
development works with the concerned municipal authority as per mutually agreed
rates or in the alternative, shall have option to mortgage fifteen percent of the total
area under all residential plots, in favour of the Director, in lieu of depositing bank
guarantee equal to twenty-five percent of the estimated cost of development works.]
(b) undertake to deposit thirty percent of the amount to be realized by him from the
plot-holders, from time to time, within ten days of its realization in a separate
account to be maintained in a scheduled bank and this amount shall only be utilized
towards meeting the cost of internal development works in the colony;
(c) undertake to pay proportionate development charges if the main lines of roads,
drainage, sewerage, water supply and electricity are to be laid out and constructed by
the Government or any other local authority. The proportion in which and the time
within which such payment is to be made shall be determined by the Director;
(d) undertake responsibility for the maintenance and upkeep of all roads, open
spaces, public parks and public health services for a period of five years from the date
of issue of the completion certificate under rule 16 unless earlier relieved of this
responsibility and there upon to transfer all such roads, open spaces, public parks
and public health services free of cost to the Government or the local authority, as the
case may be;
(e) undertake to construct at his own cost, or get constructed by any other institution
or individual at its cost, schools, hospitals, community centers and other community
buildings on the land set apart for this purpose, within a period of four years from the
date of grant of licence extendable by the Director for another period of two years, for
reasons to be recorded in writing, failing which the land shall vest with the
Government after such specified period, free of cost, in which case the Government
shall be at liberty to transfer such land to any person or institution including a local
authority, for the said purposes, on such terms and conditions, as it may deem fit;
Provided that a show cause notice and opportunity for hearing shall be given before vesting the land
in the Government;]
(f) undertake to permit the Director or any other officer authorized by him to inspect the execution
of the layout and the development works in the colony and to carry out all directions issued by him
for ensuring due compliance of the execution of the layout and development works in accordance
with the licence granted.
(g) pay such development charges including the cost of development of State/National Highways,
Transport, Irrigation and Power facilities as determined by Director (given in the 128{Schedule-A}to
these rules); and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 45M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
(h) execute bilateral agreement in Form LC-IV-A for group housing colony, in Form LC-IV-B for
plotted colony, in Form LC-IV-C for industrial colony and in Form LC-IV-D for commercial colony.]
(2) If the Director, having regard to the amenities which exist or are proposed to be provided in the
locality, decides that it is not necessary or possible to provide such amenity or amenities, the
applicant will be informed thereof and clauses (c), (d) and (e) of sub-rule (1) shall be deemed to have
been modified to that extent. (3)In case of an application for grant of licence for low-density
eco-friendly colony, the applicant shall additionally undertake to-
(a) install solar farms aiming for meeting energy requirements of the colony through solar energy, in
accordance with the technical parameters specified by the Director, on at least five percent of the
area of the colony that shall be in addition to the five percent area reserved for open spaces;
(b) provide integrated facility for storage, purification, distribution and recycling of storm-water
aiming for no external source of water supply, minimum ground water extraction and zero run-off.
Independent distribution system for separately fulfilling the farming, flushing and domestic water
requirements shall also be provided;
(c) install a bio-gas plant aimed at fulfilling requirements for cooking gas and a compost plant for
utilizing and recycling of all bio-degradable waste, in accordance with the technical parameters
specified by the Director; and,
(d) restrict the residential density of the colony to a maximum of twenty five persons per acre.(cid:129)
28. Mr. Agarwal laid emphasis on the fact that even this provision does not obligate the owner to
make any payments to HSVP. Learned counsel submitted that a reading of the bilateral agreement
which ultimately comes to be executed in Form LC IV-D clearly places the onus of paying EDC upon
the owner. It was pointed out that the payment of an EDC is envisaged to be made to HSVP through
the DTCP. Taking us through the various clauses of the bilateral agreement, Mr. Agarwal highlighted
the clauses which, according to him, establish that the rate of EDC, schedule of payment, and all
other terms and conditions in connection therewith are regulated by the Director. It was submitted
that even if the owner were to seek condonation of delay in the payment of EDC, permission in that
respect is to be obtained from the Director. It was further submitted that the Bank Guarantee
equivalent to 25% of EDC is made out in favour of the Governor of Haryana. Mr. Agarwal further
contended that the LC-V format would unerringly point towards the substance of the agreement
being one between the owner and the DTCP.
29. It was pointed out that although the demand drafts representing EDC liability were drawn in the
name of HSVP, they were physically furnished to the DTCP, Haryana. According to learned counsel
when the contract is viewed in its entirety, it would be apparent that the owner is under no
contractual or other obligation towards HSVP. It was submitted that while EDC payments may be
forwarded to the HSVP, the said authority is not empowered in law to take any steps against the
owner in case of default.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 46M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
30. It was then submitted that the communications issued by the DTCP and HSVP would
themselves establish that the payments made to HSVP would fall within the ambit of Section 196.
Our attention was specifically drawn to the Memo dated 06 October 2017 in which the DTCP had
disclosed that EDC is a charge levied by the Government for carrying out external development
works. Mr. Agarwal also took us through the reply of HSVP dated 20 November 2017 in terms of
which its Accounts Officer had categorically averred that it is not receiving any EDC payments.
Reliance was also placed on the Memo dated 19 June 2018 issued by DTCP and where it had
clarified that HSVP is only an executing agency working for and on behalf of the State Government.
According to learned counsel, once the aforesaid facts are cumulatively taken into consideration, it
would be apparent that EDC is a payment made to the Government.
31. Mr. Agarwal also placed reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court in New Delhi Municipal
Corporation v. State of Punjab and Ors.16 wherein it was held income earned or received by a State
as a Government, cannot be subjected to tax by virtue of Article 289 of the Constitution. It was his
submission that principles laid down in New Delhi Municipal Corporation are squarely applicable in
the present case as the EDC charges have been received by the DTCP and the same is income of the
State and thus not taxable.
32. According to Mr. Agarwal, factors such as the foundational agreement being between the owner
and the developer, the licence having been issued by the Government, fixation and enhancement of
EDC rates by the Government, the furnishing of a Bank Guarantee in the name of the Government
of Haryana, powers of its invocation and (1997) 7 SCC 339 release vesting in that Government, all
clearly evidence the fulcrum of the contract being between the owner and the Government of
Haryana. It was in that backdrop that Mr. Agarwal contended that EDC is liable to be viewed as an
amount which was payable to the Government and consequently the case squarely falling within the
scope of Section 196.
33. Proceeding to deconstruct Section 194C, Mr. Agarwal submitted that the said provision would be
attracted only if there be a person responsible for paying a sum to any resident for carrying out work
in pursuance of a contract between the contractor and a specified person. According to learned
counsel, the petitioner is not responsible to pay any sums to HSVP who would be liable to be viewed
as the contractor in terms of Section 194C. Emphasis was laid on the fact that there is no contractual
relationship between the petitioner and the HSVP. According to Mr. Agarwal merely because the
sum is routed to the HSVP through the DTCP, the same would be insufficient to attract the
provisions of Section 194C.
34. It was further contended by Mr. Agarwal that in some of the cases the respondents had also
sought to invoke Section 194I of the Act. According to learned counsel, Section 194I on its plain
reading would be wholly inapplicable. Learned counsel pointed out that the said provision is
concerned with income earned by way of rent. According to learned counsel undisputedly the land
over which the development is to be undertaken belonged to the petitioner and, therefore, there was
no question of an aspect of rent arising in connection therewith. It was submitted that in any case
since the land neither vested in HSVP nor was it taken on rent from that authority, Section 194I
would clearly not stand attracted. In any event according to Mr. Agarwal this issue stands concluded
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 47M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
in favour of the petitioners in light of the decision of the Court rendered in DLF Homes Panchkula.
35. Insofar as the OM dated 23 December 2017 is concerned, Mr. Agarwal submitted that the same
incorrectly proceeds on the basis that EDC is an amount payable to HSVP and thus the provisions of
Section 194C being attracted. Learned counsel pointed out that Section 194C is not founded on an
amount being payable to a person. It was contended that as per the provision itself, tax is liable to be
deducted either at the time of credit of such sum to the account of the contractor or at the time of its
payment in cash. It was in the aforesaid light that learned counsel argued that Section 194C
pre-supposes a sum being paid to a contractor as opposed to amounts being payable to an authority.
36. It was further submitted by Mr. Agarwal that the provisions of Section 201 of the Act cannot be
invoked since it would be wholly incorrect to treat the petitioners as being an assessee in default.
Learned counsel argued that it is well settled that where an issue is debatable or even arguable,
Section 201 would be inapplicable. In support of his aforenoted submission, learned counsel relied
upon the following decisions:
(I) CIT v. British Airways17 ―3. Having heard the learned counsel on both sides, we
are of the view that, on the facts and circumstances of these cases, the question on the
point of limitation formulated by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in the present
cases need not be gone into for the simple reason that, at the relevant time, there was
a debate on the question as to whether TDS was deductible under the Income Tax
Act, 1961, on foreign salary payment as a component of the total salary paid to an
expatriate working in India. This controversy came to an end vide judgment of this
Court (2010) 13 SCC 44 in CIT v. Eli Lilly & Co. (India) (P) Ltd. [(2009) 15 SCC 1 :
(2009) 312 ITR 225] The question on limitation has become academic in these cases
because, even assuming that the Department is right on the issue of limitation still
the question would arise whether on such debatable points, the assessee(s) could be
declared as assessee(s) in default under Section 192 read with Section 201 of the
Income Tax Act, 1961.(cid:129) (II) Chennai Port Trust Rajaji Salai Chennai v. The Income
Tax Officer18 ―12. The Supreme Court observed that till the decision of the Apex
Court reported in (2009) 312 ITR 225 (CIT v. Eli Lilly & Company (India) (P) Ltd.),
there was a debate on the question as to whether TDS was deductible on foreign
salary payment as a component of total salary paid to an expatriate working in India.
In the face of such debatable issue, the assessee could not be declared as an assessee in default
under Section 192 read with Section 201 of the Income Tax Act. Further, the Apex Court pointed out
that since the foreign company-assessees therein had paid the differential tax and the interest and
had further undertook not to claim refund for the amount paid, the Supreme Court held that the
orders passed under Section 201(1) and 201(1A) could not be upheld. Applying the decision of the
Apex Court to the case on hand, which we had already narrated in the preceding paragraph, with the
debate on the status of the assessee existing at least till 2000 and the assessee not having any
information as regards the order passed by the Advance Ruling Authority, we have no hesitation in
accepting the plea of the assessee that the assessee herein could not be declared as an assessee in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 48M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
default for the purpose of interest under Section 201(1A) of the Income Tax Act. It may be of
relevance to note herein that the assessee had deducted tax at 2%. The foreign company had paid tax
under Section 44BBB at 4.8% and sought for a refund. Taking note of the decision of the Apex Court
reported in (2009) 312 ITR 225 (CIT v. Eli Lilly & Company (India) (P) Ltd.) and the object
underlying Section 201 to recover the taxes where there is a shortfall, it is but necessary to find out
whether the foreign company had already remitted the tax as per Section 44BBB.(cid:129)
37. In any case, and without prejudice to the above, Mr. Agarwal submitted that the respondents are
yet to ascertain and clarify whether 2012 SCC OnLine Mad 2272 HSVP has shown EDC as its income
and has been assessed to tax on the same. It was on the aforesaid basis that learned counsel
contended that if ultimately upon assessment it is shown that EDC was treated as income and had
been so assessed to tax, then by virtue of the First Proviso to Section 201 the petitioner cannot be
treated to be an assessee in default. It was argued by Mr. Agarwal that the ITAT itself has in various
decisions held that TDS provisions are inapplicable on payment of EDC. Our attention was drawn to
the following judgments rendered by the ITAT:-
(I) Santur Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. Vs Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax, Range
77, New Delhi19.
―5. Undisputedly, demand drafts for payment of EDC were issued in the name of Chief
Administrator, HUDA for an amount of Rs. 10,11,00,000/- for the year under assessment. It is also
not in dispute that HUDA has shown EDC as current liability in the balance sheet but, in the notice
of accounts forming part of the balance sheet, it has shown that the EDC has been received for
execution of various external development works, as and when the development works are carried
out the EDC liabilities are reduced accordingly. It is also not in dispute that HUDA is engaged in
acquiring land, developing it and finally handing over to the customers for a price. It is also not in
dispute that EDC are fixed by HUDA from time to time by issuing letters/circulars. It is also not in
dispute that the assessee has not credited the amount of EDC paid to Shri Vardhman Infra Heights
Pvt. Ltd. in its P & L account. It is also not in dispute that Agreement between the land owners
intended to set up a Group Housing Society dated 30.11.2010 was entered into between M/s. Dial
Softech Pvt. Ltd., Shri Tek Ram, Smt. Saroj Singhal, Smt. Luxmi Devi and Smt. Sunehra Devi c/o
M/s. Santur Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. and the Governor of Haryana acting through the Director, Town
& Country Planning (DTCP), Haryana, whereby owner undertakes to pay proportionate EDC as per
rate, schedule, terms and conditions contained in the Agreement.

6. When we examine the question ―as to whether TDS on payment of EDC to HUDA was not to be
deducted by assessee because levy is made by DTCP having control over the EDC and not HUDA as
contended by the ld. AR for the assessee(cid:129) in the light of the aforesaid undisputed facts, we are of the
considered view that the assessee has no liability to deduct TDS in respect of the payment made to a
Government Department, DTCP in this case, u/s 196 of the Act as the payment was made to HUDA
on behalf of DTCP only xxxx xxxx xxxx

9. We are of the considered view that when payment of EDC has been made by the assessee in
accordance with licence granted by the DTCP, the payment made to HUDA was not made in
pursuance of any work contract or under statutory obligation meaning thereby that when the
assessee has no privity of contract with HUDA rather the assessee has privity of contract with DTCP,
a Government Department of Haryana, as per Agreement (supra) and the HUDA has merely
received the payment for and on behalf of DTCP, the assessee was not required to deduct the TDS.(cid:129)

―6. We have carefully considered the rival submissions. The Assessing Officer/JCIT levied penalty of
Rs.6,14,460/- under Section 271C for short deduction/non deduction of tax at source alleging
default committed by the assessee under Section 194C on payment of External Development
Charges (EDC) to Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA). With the assistance of the ld.
counsel, we find that the Directorate of Town and Country Planning, Haryana (Haryana
Government) has issued clarification on TDS deduction on EDC payments vide letter dated
19.06.2018 which is self explanatory and thus reproduced herein for ready reference:

Subject: Clarification on TDS Deductions on EDC Payments.
Please refer to the matter cited as subject above.
1. Section 2(g) of the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act, 1975
defines that external development works (hereinafter referred as EDW) shall includes
any or all infrastructure development works like water supply, sewerage, drains,
provisions of treatment and disposal of sewage, sullage and storm water, roads,
electrical works, solid waste management and disposal, slaughter houses, colleges,
hospitals, stadium/sports complex, fire stations, grid sub-stations etc. and/or any
other work which the Director may specify to be executed in the periphery of or
outside colony/area for the benefit of the colony/area.

external development works as defined in clause (g) of section 2 are to be carried out by the
Government or any other local authority. The proportion in which and the time within which, such
payment is to be made, shall be determined by the Director.

of the colony/area are being executed by Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran thereafter HSVP)
which is the Development Authority or state Govt. Earlier upto 31.03.2017, Department of Town 8t
Country Planning used to collect the external development charges from the colonizer to whom
licences have been granted under Act No. 8 of 1975 and the persons to whom permission for change

of CA, HSVP and send the same to CA, HSVP.
4. As the receipt on account of EDC was not sufficient to carry out the all development works under
EDC for the urban estate as per approved development plans, therefore to meet out the shortfall, a
new scheme Swaran Jayanti Haryana Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme (renamed as
Mangal Nagar Vikas Yojana was approved by the State Govt. and appropriate budget provision for
execution of development works has been made in the said scheme. From Financial Year 2017-18,
the receipts on account of EDC is being deposited in the consolidated fund of the State under Major
Receipt Head-0217 receipts and all license/CLU holders have also been directed vide order dated
12.05,2017 that payment of EDC in respect of license/CLU granted by TCP Deptt. may be made
online through epayment gateway or in shape of demand drafts favouring Director, Town 6 Country
Planning, Haryana. Required funds for execution of development works are released to HSVP after
granting the sanction from the Finance Department.
It is, therefore, clarified that HSVP is only an executing agency for and on behalf of State Govt. For
carrying out EDW for which funds are given to HSVP by the Govt. through TCP Deptt. Since,
payment for EDC has been made to TCP Deptt. of State Govt., no TDS was/is to be deducted out of
payment made to Govt. for EDW.
Accounts officer (HO) For: Director Town & Country Planning Haryana, Chandigarh
7. On the basis of the aforesaid clarification, the assessee contends that the payment to HUDA is, in
effect, payment to State Government and therefore such payment is exempt from obligations to
deduct TDS in view of Section 196 of the Act.(cid:129) (IV) M/S Perfect Constech Pvt. Ltd. Versus Addl.
CIT22 ―5.0 We have heard the rival submissions and have also perused the material on record. It is
seen that in Para 4.3.2, subparagraph
(iv) of the order passed u/s 271C of the Act, the AO has himself noted that the demanddraft of the
EDC amounts are drawn in favour of the Chief Administrator, HUDA though routed through the
Director General, Town and Country Planning, Sector-18, Chandigarh. He has also referred to the
notes to accounts to the financial statements of HUDA wherein it has been stated that ―other
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 51M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
liabilities also include external development charges received through DGTCP, Department of
Haryana for execution of various EDC works. The expenditure against which have been booked in
Development Work in Progress, Enhancement compensation and Land cost.(cid:129) Undisputedly, the
payment of EDC was issued in the name of Chief Administrator, HUDA. It is also not in dispute that
HUDA has shown EDC as current liability in the balance sheet, but in the ‗Notes' to the Accounts
Forming part of the Balance Sheet, it has been shown that EDC has been received for execution of
various external development works and as and when the development works are carried out, the
EDC's liabilities are reduced accordingly. It is also not in dispute that HUDA is engaged in acquiring
land, developing it and finally handing it over for a price. It is also not in dispute that EDC is fixed
by HUDA from time to time. However, the fact of the matter remains that payment has been made
to HUDA through DTCP which is a Government Department and the same is not in pursuance to
any contract between the assessee and HUDA. Thus, the payment of EDC is not for carrying out any
specific work to be done by HUDA for and on behalf of the assessee but rather DTCP which is a
Government Department which levies these charges for carrying out external development and
engages the services of HUDA for execution of the work. Therefore, it is our considered view that the
assessee was not required to deduct tax at source at the time of payment of EDC as the same was not
out of any statutory or contractual liability towards HUDA and, therefore, the impugned penalty was
not leviable. We note that similar view has been taken by the Co-ordinate Benches of ITAT Delhi in
the cases of Santur Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. vs. ACIT in ITA 6844/Del/2019 vide order dated
18.12.2019, Sarv Estate Pvt. Ltd. vs. JCIT in ITA No.5337 & 5338/Del/2019 vide order dated
13.09.2019 and Shiv Sai Infrastructure (Pvt.) Ltd. vs. ACIT in view was also taken by the Co-ordinate
Bench of ITAT Delhi in case of R.P.S Infrastructure Ltd. vs. ACIT in 5805, 5806 & 5349/Del/2019
vide order dated 23.07.2019. Therefore, on an 2020 (12) TMI 1158 ITAT Delhi identical facts and
respectfully following the orders of the Co- ordinate Benches as aforesaid, we hold that the
impugned penalty u/s 271C of the Act is not sustainable. The order of the Ld. CIT (A) is set aside and
the penalty is directed to be deleted. 6.0 In the final result, the appeal of the assessee stands
allowed.(cid:129)
38. Leading submissions on behalf of the respondents, Mr. Zoheb Hossain firstly submitted that
payments made to HSVP cannot be equated with payments made to the Government. Mr. Hossain
pointed out that HSVP has come to be constituted by virtue of the provisions of the Haryana Urban
Development Authority Act, 197723, a State legislation, and thus clearly placing that authority
outside the ambit of Section 196 of the Act. It was his submission that authorities constituted under
State legislations cannot claim coverage under Section 196, since the same is confined to sums
payable to either the Government, the Reserve Bank or a corporation established by or under a
Central Act. Mr. Hossain cited for our consideration the decision of the Supreme Court in Adityapur
Industrial Area Development Authority v. Union of India24 where a contention that an authority
constituted under a State Legislation would be exempt from taxation by virtue of Article 289 of the
Constitution, came to be negatived in unequivocal terms. Mr. Hossain laid emphasis on the
following passages from that decision:
―11. It is true, as submitted by Shri Venugopal, that clause (2) of Article 289
empowers Parliament to make a law imposing a tax on income earned only from
trade or business of any kind carried by or on behalf of the State. It does not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 52M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
authorise Parliament to impose a tax on the income of a State if such income is not
earned in the manner contemplated by clause (2) of Article 289. This, to our mind,
does not answer the question which arises for our consideration in this appeal. Clause
(2) of Article 289 presupposes that the income sought to be taxed by the Union is
1977 Act (2006) SCC OnLine SC 530 the income of the State, but the question to be
answered at the threshold is whether in terms of clause (1) of Article 289, the income
of the appellant Authority is the income of the State.
Having regard to the provisions of the Bihar Industrial Area Development Authority Act, 1974,
particularly Section 17 thereof, we have no manner of doubt that the income of the appellant
Authority constituted under the said Act is its own income and that the appellant Authority manages
its own funds. It has its own assets and liabilities. It can sue or be sued in its own name. Even
though, it does not carry on any trade or business within the contemplation of clause (2) of Article
289, it still is an authority constituted under an Act of the legislature of the State having a distinct
legal personality, being a body corporate, as distinct from the State. Section 17 of the Act further
clarifies that only upon its dissolution its assets, funds and liabilities devolve upon the State
Government. Necessarily therefore, before its dissolution, its assets, funds and liabilities are its own.
It is, therefore, futile to contend that the income of the appellant Authority is the income of the State
Government, even though the Authority is constituted under an Act enacted by the State Legislature
by issuance of a notification by the Government thereunder.
12. According to Basu's Commentary on the Constitution of India, (6th Edn., p. 50, Vol. ‗L') Articles
285 and 289 are analogous to each other inasmuch as while Article 285 exempts the Union property
from State taxation, Article 289 exempts the State property from Union taxation. While clause (1) of
Article 289 exempts from Union taxation any income of a State, derived from governmental or
non-governmental activities, clause (2) provides an exception, namely, that income derived by a
State from trade or business will be taxable, provided a law is made by Parliament in that behalf.
Clause (3) of Article 289 is an exception of the exception prescribed by clause (2) of Article 289 and
it provides that income derived from particular trade or business may be made immune from Union
taxation if Parliament declares such trade or business as incidental to the ordinary functions of the
Government (emphasis supplied). The reason is obvious. Under the Constitution, the State has no
power to tax any income other than agricultural income. Under the Constitution, power to tax
―income(cid:129) is vested only in the Union. Therefore, while any property of the Union is immune from
State taxation under Article 285(1), income derived by the State from business, as distinguished
from governmental purposes, shall not have exemption from Union taxation unless Parliament
declares such trade or business as incidental to the ordinary functions of the Government of the
State [see Article 289(3)] (emphasis supplied) xxxx xxxx xxxx
14. In A.P. SRTC v. ITO [(1964) 7 SCR 17 : AIR 1964 SC 1486] the question arose as to whether the
income derived from trading activity by the Andhra Pradesh Road Transport Corporation
established under the Road Transport Corporation Act, 1950 was not the income of the State of
Andhra Pradesh within the meaning of Article 289(1) of the Constitution and hence exempted from
Union taxation. This Court considered the scheme of Article 289 and observed as follows: (SCR p.
25) ―The scheme of Article 289 appears to be that ordinarily, the income derived by a State both
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 53M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
from governmental and non-governmental or commercial activities shall be immune from income
tax levied by the Union, provided, of course, the income in question can be said to be the income of
the State. This general proposition flows from clause (1).
Clause (2) then provides an exception and authorises the Union to impose a tax in respect of the
income derived by the Government of a State from trade or business carried on by it, or on its
behalf; that is to say, the income from trade or business carried on by the Government of a State or
on its behalf which would not have been taxable under clause (1), can be taxed, provided a law is
made by Parliament in that behalf. If clause (1) had stood by itself, it may not have been easy to
include within its purview income derived by a State from commercial activities, but since clause
(2), in terms, empowers Parliament to make a law levying a tax on commercial activities carried on
by or on behalf of a State, the conclusion is inescapable that these activities were deemed to have
been included in clause (1) and that alone can be the justification for the words in which clause (2)
has been adopted by the Constitution. It is plain that clause (2) proceeds on the basis that but for its
provision, the trading activity which is covered by it would have claimed exemption from Union
taxation under clause (1). That is the result of reading clauses (1) and (2) together.
Clause (3) then empowers Parliament to declare by law that any trade or business would be taken
out of the purview of clause (2) and restored to the area covered by clause (1) by declaring that the
said trade or business is incidental to the ordinary functions of the Government. In other words,
clause (3) is an exception to the exception prescribed by clause (2). Whatever trade or business is
declared to be incidental to the ordinary functions of the Government, would cease to be governed
by clause (2) and would then be exempt from Union taxation. That, broadly stated, appears to be the
result of the scheme adopted by the three clauses of Article 289.(cid:129)
15. Reading these three clauses together this Court held that the property as well as the income in
respect of which exemption is claimed under clause (1) must be the property and income of the
State, and thus the crucial question to be answered is: ―Is the income derived by the State from its
transport activities the income of the State?(cid:129) It was observed that if a trade or business is carried on
by a State departmentally or through its agents appointed exclusively for that purpose, there would
be no difficulty in holding that the income made from such trade or business is the income of the
State. Difficulties arise when one is dealing with trade or business carried on by a corporation
established by a State by issuing a notification under the relevant provisions of the Act. In this
context, the Court observed: (SCR p.
26) ―The corporation, though statutory, has a personality of its own and this personality is distinct
from that of the State or other shareholders. It cannot be said that a shareholder owns the property
of the corporation or carries on the business with which the corporation is concerned. The doctrine
that a corporation has a separate legal entity of its own is so firmly rooted in our notions derived
from common law that it is hardly necessary to deal with it elaborately; and so, prima facie, the
income derived by the appellant from its trading activity cannot be claimed by the State which is one
of the shareholders of the corporation.(cid:129) xxxx xxxx xxxx
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 54M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
17. Considerable reliance was placed on the principles laid down in the aforesaid decision by learned
counsel appearing for the Union of India. He submitted that having regard to the provisions of the
Act under which the appellant Authority is established, the same conclusion may be reached. In
particular, emphasising the fact that as in A.P. SRTC case [(1964) 7 SCR 17 : AIR 1964 SC 1486] so in
the instant case as well, Section 17 of the Act provides that upon dissolution of the appellant
Authority, the properties, funds and dues realisable by the Authority along with its liabilities shall
devolve upon the State Government. Impliedly, therefore, such properties, funds and dues vest in
the Authority till its dissolution, and only thereafter it vests in the State Government. He also
referred to various other provisions of the Act and submitted that there was nothing in the Act
which attempted to lift the veil from the face of the Corporation. Even though the Authority was
created under an Act of the Legislature, it was still an authority which had a distinct personality of
its own, having perpetual succession and a common seal, with powers to acquire, hold and dispose
of property, and to contract, and could sue and be sued in its own name. Shri Venugopal, on the
other hand, tried to distinguish the judgment on the ground that the Andhra Pradesh Road
Transport Corporation is being run on business lines, and a corporation that runs on business lines
is distinguishable and different from a corporation which is not run on those lines. Even if such a
distinction is drawn, that will not have the effect of making the income of the Corporation the
income of the State Government having regard to the other features noticed above.
xxxx xxxx xxx
20. Similarly, the decision in New Delhi Municipal Council v. State of Punjab [(1997) 7 SCC 339]
does not advance the case of the appellant. It was held that the property/municipal taxes levied by
the New Delhi Municipal Council under the relevant Act constituted Union taxation within the
meaning of clause (1) of Article 289 of the Constitution. The levy of property taxes under the
aforesaid enactments on lands or buildings belonging to the State Government was invalid and
incompetent by virtue of the mandate contained in clause (1) of Article 289. However, if any land or
building is used or occupied for the purpose of any trade or business, meaning thereby a trade or
business carried on with profit motive, by or on behalf of the State Government, such land or
building shall be subject to the levy of the property taxes levied by the said enactments. In other
words, State property exempted under clause (1) means such property as is used for the purpose of
the Government and not for the purpose of trade or business. That was a case where the question
arose in relation to the levy of property tax on lands and buildings owned by the State Governments
which was ―property of the State Government(cid:129). In the instant case, we are concerned with the
income of the appellant Authority and the same principles apply. The exemption can be claimed
only if the income can be said to be the income of the State Government. In the facts of this case, it is
not possible to hold that the income of the appellant Authority is the income of the State
Government.(cid:129)
39. According to learned counsel, the statutory scheme in the context of which Adityapur Industrial
Area came to be rendered, is similar to that which underlies the 1977 Act. Mr. Hossain laid emphasis
on the right of HSVP to manage its own funds, its right to independently own assets, as well as the
right to sue/ be sued in its own name. According to learned counsel, all of the above would tend to
establish and evidence the conferral of a distinct legal personality upon HSVP. It was additionally

pointed out that in terms of the 1977 Act in case HSVP were to be dissolved, its assets, funds and
liabilities would devolve upon the State Government. According to learned counsel, all of the above
places HSVP in a position identical to Adityapur Industrial Area. In view of the above, according to
Mr. Hossain, the submission that the income of HSVP would be exempt by virtue of Article 289 of
the Constitution deserves outright rejection.
40. Mr. Hossain also submitted that while considering the applicability of the provisions of the 1977
Act, the nature of functions that may be performed or discharged by HSVP is wholly irrelevant.
According to learned counsel taxability is not dependent upon the functions or duties that may be
discharged by an authority. According to Mr. Hossain even if the functions performed by HSVP were
to be viewed as being akin to basic governmental functions, the same would have no bearing on the
question of taxability.
41. It was submitted that the petitioners also incorrectly assert HSVP to be a local authority. This
argument, according to Mr. Hossain, is liable to be turned down on the plain language of Section
10(20) of the Act and which defines a ―local authority(cid:129) as under:
―10. Incomes not included in total income (20) the income of a local authority which
is chargeable under the head, ―Income from house property(cid:129), ―Capital gains(cid:129), or
―Income from other sources(cid:129) or from a trade or business carried on by it which
accrues or arises from the supply of a commodity or service (not being water or
electricity) within its own jurisdictional area or from the supply of water or electricity
within or outside its own jurisdictional area;
[Explanation.--For the purposes of this clause, the expression ―local authority(cid:129) means--
(i) Panchayat as referred to in clause (d) of Article 243 of the Constitution; or
(ii) Municipality as referred to in clause (e) of Article 243-P of the Constitution; or
(iii) Municipal Committee and District Board, legally entitled to, or entrusted by the Government
with, the control or management of a Municipal or local fund; or
(iv) Cantonment Board as defined in Section 3 of the Cantonments Act, 1924;](cid:129)
42. According to learned counsel, a plain reading of Section 10(20) of the Act would establish that
HSVP cannot be treated to be a local authority. In any case according to Mr. Hossain this aspect
stands conclusively settled and answered against the writ petitioners by the Supreme Court in terms
of its decision rendered in New Okhla Industrial Development Authority v. CIT25. Mr. Hossain
relied upon the following observations as rendered in that judgment:
―27. The KishansingTomar v. Municipal Corpn., Ahmedabad [Kishansing Tomar v.
Municipal Corpn., Ahmedabad, (2006) 8 SCC 352] , noticing the object and purpose
of the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, stated the following: (SCC p. 358,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 56M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
para 12) ―12. It may be noted that Part IX-A was inserted in the Constitution by
virtue of the Constitution (Seventy-fourth) Amendment Act, 1992. The object of
introducing these provisions was that in many States the local bodies were not
working properly and the timely elections were not being held and the nominated
bodies were continuing for long periods. Elections had been irregular and many
times unnecessarily delayed or postponed and the elected bodies had been
superseded or suspended without adequate justification at the whims and fancies of
the State authorities. These views were expressed by the then Minister of State for
Urban Development while introducing the Constitution Amendment Bill before
Parliament and (2018) 9 SCC 351 thus the new provisions were added in the
Constitution with a view to restore the rightful place in political governance for local
bodies. It was considered necessary to provide a constitutional status to such bodies
and to ensure regular and fair conduct of elections. In the Statement of Objects and
Reasons in the Constitution Amendment Bill relating to urban local bodies, it was
stated....(cid:129)
28. The constitutional provisions as contained in Part IX-A delineate that the
Constitution itself provided for constitution of Municipalities, duration of
Municipalities, powers of Authorities and responsibilities of the Municipalities. The
Municipalities are created as vibrant democratic units of self-government. The
duration of Municipality was provided for five years contemplating regular election
for electing representatives to represent the Municipality. The special features of the
Municipality as was contemplated by the constitutional provisions contained in Part
IX-A cannot be said to be present in the Authority as delineated by the statutory
scheme of the 1976 Act.
It is true that various municipal functions are also being performed by the Authority as per the 1976
Act but the mere facts that certain municipal functions were also performed by the authority it
cannot acquire the essential features of the Municipality which are contemplated by Part IX-A of the
Constitution. The main thrust of the argument of the learned counsel for the appellant that the High
Court having not adverted to the Notification dated 24-12-2001 issued under the proviso to Article
243-Q(1) the judgments relied on by the High Court for dismissing the writ petition are not
sustainable. We thus have to focus on the proviso to Article 243-Q(1). For the purpose and object of
the industrial township referred to therein whether industrial township mentioned therein can be
equated with Municipality as defined under Article 243-P(e). Article 243-P(e) provides that the
―Municipality(cid:129) means an institution of self- government constituted under Article 243-Q. Whether
the appellant is an institution of self-government constituted under Article 243-Q is the main
question to be answered? Clause (1) of Article 243-Q provides that there shall be constituted in every
State, a Nagar Panchayat, a Municipal Council and a Municipal Corporation, in accordance with the
provisions of this Part. The proviso to clause (1) provides that:
―Provided that a Municipality under this clause may not be constituted in such urban
area or part thereof as the Governor may, having regard to the size of the area and the
municipal services being provided or proposed to be provided by an industrial
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 57M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
establishment in that area and such other factors as he may deem fit, by public
notification, specify to be an industrial township.(cid:129)
29. Thus, the proviso does not contemplate constitution of an industrial
establishment as a Municipality rather clarifies an exception where Municipality
under clause (1) of Article 243-Q may not be constituted in an urban area. The
proviso is an exception to the constitution of Municipality as contemplated by clause
(1) of Article 243-Q. No other interpretation of the proviso conforms to the
constitution scheme.
30. A Constitution Bench of this Court had noticed the principles of statutory
interpretation of a proviso in S. Sundaram Pillai v. V.R. Pattabiraman [S. Sundaram
Pillai v. V.R. Pattabiraman, (1985) 1 SCC 591] . The following has been laid down by
this Court in paras 37 to 43: (SCC pp. 609-10) ―37. In short, generally speaking, a
proviso is intended to limit the enacted provision so as to except something which
would have otherwise been within it or in some measure to modify the enacting
clause. Sometimes a proviso may be embedded in the main provision and becomes an
integral part of it so as to amount to a substantive provision itself.
38. Apart from the authorities referred to above, this Court has in a long course of
decisions explained and adumbrated the various shades, aspects and elements of a
proviso. In State of Rajasthan v. Leela Jain [State of Rajasthan v. Leela Jain, AIR
1965 SC 1296] , the following observations were made: (AIR p. 1300, para 14) ‗14. ...
So far as a general principle of construction of a proviso is concerned, it has been
broadly stated that the function of a proviso is to limit the main part of the section
and carve out something which but for the proviso would have been within the
operative part.'
39. In STO v. Hanuman Prasad [STO v. Hanuman Prasad, AIR 1967 SC 565],
Bhargava, J. observed thus:
(AIR p. 567, para 5) ‗5. ... It is well recognised that a proviso is added to a principal
clause primarily with the object of taking out of the scope of that principal clause
what is included in it and what the legislature desires should be excluded.'
40. In CCT v. Ramkishan Shri kishan Jhaver [CCT v. Ramkishan Shrikishan Jhaver,
AIR 1968 SC 59] , this Court made the following observations: (AIR p. 63, para 8) ‗8.
... Generally speaking, it is true that the proviso is an exception to the main part of
the section; but it is recognised that in exceptional cases a proviso may be a
substantive provision itself.'
41. In Dwarka Prasad v. Dwarka Das Saraf [Dwarka Prasad v. Dwarka Das Saraf,
(1976) 1 SCC 128] Krishna Iyer, J. speaking for the Court observed thus: (SCC pp.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 58M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
136-37, paras 16 & 18) ‗16. There is some validity in this submission but if, on a fair construction,
the principal provision is clear, a proviso cannot expand or limit it. Sometimes a proviso is engrafted
by an apprehensive draftsman to remove possible doubts, to make matters plain, to light up
ambiguous edges. Here, such is the case.
***
18. ... If the rule of construction is that prima facie a proviso should be limited in its operation to the
subject-matter of the enacting clause, the stand we have taken is sound. To expand the enacting
clause, inflated by the proviso, sins against the fundamental rule of construction that a proviso must
be considered in relation to the principal matter to which it stands as a proviso. A proviso ordinarily
is but a proviso, although the golden rule is to read the whole section, inclusive of the proviso, in
such manner that they mutually throw light on each other and result in a harmonious construction.'
42. In Hiralal Rattanlal v. State of U.P. [Hiralal Rattanlal v. State of U.P., (1973) 1 SCC 216 : 1973
SCC (Tax) 307 : AIR 1973 SC 1034] , this Court made the following observations: [SCC p. 224, para
22: SCC (Tax) p. 315] ‗22. ... Ordinarily a proviso to a section is intended to take out a part of the
main section for special treatment. It is not expected to enlarge the scope of the main section. But
cases have arisen in which this Court has held that despite the fact that a provision is called proviso,
it is really a separate provision and the so-called proviso has substantially altered the main section.'
43. We need not multiply authorities after authorities on this point because the legal position seems
to be clearly and manifestly well established. To sum up, a proviso may serve four different
purposes:
(1) qualifying or excepting certain provisions from the main enactment;
(2) it may entirely change the very concept of the intendment of the enactment by
insisting on certain mandatory conditions to be fulfilled in order to make the
enactment workable;
(3) it may be so embedded in the Act itself as to become an integral part of the
enactment and thus acquire the tenor and colour of the substantive enactment itself;
and (4) it may be used merely to act as an optional addenda to the enactment with
the sole object of explaining the real intendment of the statutory provision.(cid:129)
31. Applying the rules of interpretation as laid down by this Court, it is clear that the
proviso is an exception to the constitutional provisions which provide that there shall
be constituted in every State a Nagar Panchayat, a Municipal Council and a
Municipal Corporation. Exception is covered by the proviso that where an industrial
township is providing municipal services the Governor having regard to the size of
the area and the municipal services either being provided or proposed to be provided
by an industrial establishment specify it to be an industrial township. The words
―industrial township(cid:129) have been used in contradiction of a Nagar Panchayat, a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 59M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
Municipal Council and a Municipal Corporation. The object of issuance of
notification is to relieve the mandatory requirement of constitution of a Municipality
in a State in the circumstances as mentioned in the proviso but exemption from
constituting Municipality does not lead to mean that the industrial establishment
which is providing municipal services to an industrial township is same as
Municipality as defined in Article 243-P(e). We have already noticed that Article
243-P(e) defines ―Municipality(cid:129) as an institution of self-government constituted
under Article 243-Q, the word ―constituted(cid:129) used under Article 243-P(e) read with
Article 243-Q clearly refers to the constitution in every State of a Nagar Panchayat, a
Municipal Council or a Municipal Corporation. Further, the words in the proviso ―a
Municipality under this clause may not be constituted(cid:129) clearly means that the words
―may not be constituted(cid:129) used in the proviso are clearly in contradistinction with the
word ―constituted(cid:129) as used in Article 243-P(e) and Article 243-Q. Thus, notification
under the proviso to Article 243-Q(1) is not akin to constitution of Municipality. We,
thus, are clear in our mind that industrial township as specified under the
Notification dated 24-12-2001 is not akin to Municipality as contemplated under
Article 243-Q.
32. At this juncture, we may also notice the two judgments as relied on by the High
Court and three more judgments where Article 243-Q came for consideration. The
first judgment which needs to be noticed is Adityapur Industrial Area Development
Authority [Adityapur Industrial Area Development Authority v. Union of India,
(2006) 5 SCC 100] . The Adityapur Industrial Development Authority was
constituted under the Bihar Industrial Area Development Authority Act, 1974. In
para 2 of the judgment the constitution of the authority was noticed which is to the
following effect: (SCC p. 103) ―2. The appellant Authority has been constituted under
the Bihar Industrial Area Development Authority Act, 1974 to provide for planned
development of industrial area, for promotion of industries and matters appurtenant
thereto.
The appellant Authority is a body corporate having perpetual succession and a common seal with
power to acquire, hold and dispose of properties, both movable and immovable, to contract, and by
the said name sue or be sued. The Authority consists of a Chairman, a Managing Director and five
other Directors appointed by the State Government. The Authority is responsible for the planned
development of the industrial area including preparation of the master plan of the area and
promotion of industries in the area and other amenities incidental thereto. The Authority has its
own establishment for which it is authorised to frame regulations with prior approval of the State
Government. The State Government is authorised to entrust the Authority from time to time with
any work connected with planned development, or maintenance of the industrial area and its
amenities and matters connected thereto. Section 7 of the Act obliges the Authority to maintain its
own fund to which shall be credited monies received by the Authority from the State Government by
way of grants, loans, advances or otherwise, all fees, rents, charges, levies and fines received by the
Authority under the Act, all monies received by the Authority from disposal of its movable or
immovable assets and all monies received by the Authority by way of loan from financial and other
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 60M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
institutions and debentures floated for the execution of a scheme or schemes of the Authority duly
approved by the State Government. Unless the State Government directs otherwise, all monies
received by the Authority shall be credited to its funds which shall be kept with State Bank of India
and/or one or more of the nationalised banks and drawn as and when required by the Authority.(cid:129)
33. On the question as to whether the Adityapur Industrial Area Development Authority was
covered within the meaning of local authority as per Section 10(20) as amended by the Finance Act,
2002, the High Court held that the appellant Authority could not have claimed benefit under the
provisions after 1-4-2003. In paras 6 and 7, the following was held: (Adityapur Industrial Area
Development Authority case [Adityapur Industrial Area Development Authority v. Union of India,
(2006) 5 SCC 100] , SCC pp. 104-05) ―6. It would thus be seen that the income of a local authority
chargeable under the head ―Income from house property(cid:129), ―Capital gains(cid:129) or ―Income from other
sources(cid:129) or from a trade or business carried on by it was earlier excluded in computing the total
income of the Authority of a previous year. However, in view of the amendment, with effect from
1-4-2003 the Explanation ―local authority(cid:129) was defined to include only the authorities enumerated
in the Explanation, which does not include an authority such as the appellant. At the same time
Section 10(20-A) which related to income of an authority constituted in India by or under any law
enacted for the purpose of dealing with and satisfying the need for housing accommodation or for
the purpose of planning, development or improvement of cities, towns and villages, which before the
amendment was not included in computing the total income, was omitted. Consequently, the benefit
conferred by clause (20-A) on such an authority was taken away.
7. The High Court by its impugned judgment [Adityapur Industrial Area Development Authority v.
Union of India, 2003 SCC OnLineJhar 227 : 2003 AIR Jhar R 876] and order held that in view of
the fact that Section 10(20-A) was omitted and an Explanation was added to Section 10(20)
enumerating the ―local authorities(cid:129) contemplated by Section 10(20), the appellant Authority could
not claim any benefit under those provisions after 1-4-2003. It further held that the exemption
under Article 289(1) was also not available to the appellant Authority as it was a distinct legal entity,
and its income could not be said to be the income of the State so as to be exempt from Union
taxation. The said decision of the High Court is impugned in this appeal.(cid:129)
38. The Court further held that the Explanation under Section 10(20) provides an exhaustive
definition and the tests laid down by this Court in an earlier case i.e. Union of India v. R.C. Jain
[Union of India v. R.C. Jain, (1981) 2 SCC 308 : 1981 SCC (L&S) 323] , are no longer applicable. In
para 35 the following was stated: (Agricultural Produce Market Committee case [Agricultural
Produce Market Committee v. CIT, (2008) 9 SCC 434] , SCC p. 451) ―35. One more aspect needs to
be mentioned. In R.C. Jain [Union of India v. R.C. Jain, (1981) 2 SCC 308 :
1981 SCC (L&S) 323] the test of ―like nature(cid:129) was adopted as the words ―other
authority(cid:129) came after the words ―Municipal Committee, District Board, Body of Port
Commissioners(cid:129). Therefore, the words ―other authority(cid:129) in Section 3(31) took colour
from the earlier words, namely, ―Municipal Committee, District Board or Body of
Port Commissioners(cid:129). This is how the functional test is evolved in R.C. Jain [Union
of India v. R.C. Jain, (1981) 2 SCC 308 : 1981 SCC (L&S) 323] . However, as stated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 61M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
earlier, Parliament in its legislative wisdom has omitted the words ―other authority(cid:129)
from the said Explanation to Section 10(20) of the 1961 Act. The said Explanation to
Section 10(20) provides a definition to the word ―local authority(cid:129). It is an exhaustive
definition. It is not an inclusive definition. The words ―other authority(cid:129) do not find
place in the said Explanation. Even, according to the appellant(s), AMC(s) is neither a
Municipal Committee nor a District Board nor a Municipal Committee nor a
panchayat. Therefore, in our view functional test and the test of incorporation as laid
down in R.C. Jain [Union of India v. R.C. Jain, (1981) 2 SCC 308 : 1981 SCC (L&S)
323] is no more applicable to the Explanation to Section 10(20) of the 1961 Act.
Therefore, in our view the judgment of this Court in R.C. Jain [Union of India v. R.C.
Jain, (1981) 2 SCC 308 : 1981 SCC (L&S) 323] followed by judgments of various High
Courts on the status and character of AMC(s) is no more applicable to the provisions
of Section 10(20) after the insertion of the Explanation/definition clause to that sub-
section vide the Finance Act, 2002.(cid:129) B. Section 10(20) as amended by the Finance Act, 2002
44. We have already noticed that by the Finance Act, 2002 an Explanation has been added to
Section 10(20) of the 1961 IT Act and Section 10(20-A) has been omitted. Prior to the Finance Act,
2002 there being no definition of ―local authority(cid:129) under the IT Act, the provisions of Section 3(31)
of the General Clauses Act, 1897 were pressed into service while interpreting the extent and meaning
of local authority. The Explanation having now contained the exhaustive definition of local
authority, the definition of local authority as contained in Section 3(31) of the General Clauses Act,
1897 is no more applicable. Section 3 of the General Clauses Act begins with the words ―In this Act,
and in all Central Acts and Regulations made after the commencement of this Act, unless there is
anything repugnant in the subject or context...(cid:129). The definition given of the local authority under
Section 3(31) does not now govern the field in view of the express omission of the expression ―all
other authority(cid:129). This Court has already in Agricultural Produce Market Committee [Agricultural
Produce Market Committee v. CIT, (2008) 9 SCC 434] held that the definition under Section 3(31)
of the General Clauses Act is now no more applicable to interpret local authority under Section
10(20) of the IT Act. Before we proceed further it shall be useful to notice certain well-settled
principles of statutory interpretation of fiscal statutes.
45. This Court in A.V. Fernandez v. State of Kerala [A.V. Fernandez v. State of Kerala, AIR 1957 SC
657] laid down the following: (AIR p. 661, para 29) ―29. It is no doubt true that in construing fiscal
statutes and in determining the liability of a subject to tax one must have regard to the strict letter of
the law and not merely to the spirit of the statute or the substance of the law. If the Revenue satisfies
the court that the case falls strictly within the provisions of the law, the subject can be taxed. If, on
the other hand, the case is not covered within the four corners of the provisions of the taxing statute,
no tax can be imposed by inference or by analogy or by trying to probe into the intentions of the
legislature and by considering what was the substance of the matter. We must of necessity,
therefore, have regard to the actual provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder before we
can come to the conclusion that the appellant was liable to assessment as contended by the Sales
Tax Authorities.(cid:129)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 62M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
46. This Court in Rajasthan Rajya SahakariSpg. & Ginning Mills Federation Ltd. v. CIT [Rajasthan
Rajya SahakariSpg. & Ginning Mills Federation Ltd. v. CIT, (2014) 11 SCC 672] again reiterated that
there has to be strict interpretation of taxing statutes and further the fact that one class of legal
entities is given some benefit which is specifically stated in the Act does not mean that the legal
entities not referred to in the Act would also get the same benefit. The following was laid down in
para 23: (SCC p. 678) ―23. We are also of the view that in all the tax matters one has to interpret the
taxation statute strictly. Simply because one class of legal entities are given some benefit which is
specifically stated in the Act does not mean that the legal entities not referred to in the Act would
also get the same benefit. As stated by this Court on several occasions, there is no equity in matters
of taxation. One cannot read into a section which has not been specifically provided for and
therefore, we do not agree with the submissions of the learned counsel appearing for the appellant
and we are not prepared to read something in the section which has not been provided for. The
judgments referred to hereinabove support the view which we have expressed here.(cid:129)
47. It shall be useful to refer to the Explanatory Notes on the Finance Act, 2002. Explanatory Notes
both on Section 10(20) and Section 10(20-A) are relevant and contained in paras 12.2 to 12.4 and
13.1 to 13.4. Paras 12.2. to 12.4 under the heading: Income of certain local authorities to become
taxable are to the following effect:
―12.2. Through the Finance Act, 2002, this exemption has been restricted to the
Panchayats and Municipalities as referred to in Articles 243(d) and 243-P(e) of the
Constitution of India respectively. Municipal Committees and District Boards, legally
entitled to or entrusted by the Government with the control or management of a
Municipal or a local fund and Cantonment Boards as defined under Section 3 of the
Cantonments Act, 1924. 12.3. The exemption under clause (20) of Section 10 would,
therefore, not be available to Agricultural Marketing Societies and Agricultural
Marketing Boards, etc., despite the fact that they may be deemed to be treated as
local authorities under any other Central or State Legislation. Exemption under this
clause would not be available to port trusts also.
12.4. This amendment will take effect from 1-4-2003 and will, accordingly, apply in
relation to Assessment Year 2003-2004 and subsequent assessment years.(cid:129)
48. Further paras 13.1 to 13.4 of the Explanatory Notes contained heading: ―Income of certain
Housing Boards, etc. to become taxable(cid:129) on deletion of clause (20-A), are as stated below:
―13.1. Under the existing provisions contained in clause (20-A) of Section 10, income
of the Housing Boards or other statutory authorities set up for the purpose of dealing
with or satisfying the need for housing accommodations or for the purpose of
planning, development or improvement of cities, towns and villages is exempt from
payment of income tax.
13.2. Through the Finance Act, 2002, clause (20-A) of Section 10 has been deleted so
as to withdraw exemption available to the abovementioned bodies. The income of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 63M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
Housing Boards of the States and of Development Authorities would, therefore, also
become taxable. 13.3. Under Section 80-G, donation made to housing authorities, etc.
referred to in clause (20-A) of Section 10 is eligible for 50% deduction from total
income in the hands of the donors. Since clause (20-A) of Section 10 has been
deleted, donation to the housing authorities, etc. would not be eligible for deduction
in the hands of the donors and this may result in drying up of donations. To continue
the incentive to donation made to housing authorities, etc., Section 80-G has been
amended so as to provide that 50% of the sum paid by an assessee to an authority
constituted in India by or under any law enacted either for the purpose of dealing
with and satisfying the need for housing accommodation or for the purpose of
planning, development or improvement of cities, towns and villages, or for both, shall
be deducted from the total income of such assessee.
13.4. These amendments will take effect from 1-4-2003 and will, accordingly, apply in
relation to Assessment Year 2003-2004 and subsequent assessment years.(cid:129)
49. The Explanatory Note clearly indicates that by the Finance Act, 2002 the exemption under
Section 10(20) has been restricted to the Panchayats and Municipalities as referred to in Articles
243-P(d) and 243-P(e). Further by deletion of clause (20-A), the income of the Housing Boards of
the States and of Development Authorities became taxable.
50. On a writ petition filed by the appellant before the Allahabad High Court where the notices
issued in the year 1998 under Section 142 of the Income Tax Act were challenged vide its judgment
dated 14-2-2000, the High Court held that the appellant's case comes squarely under Section
10(20-A) of the Income Tax Act, hence, the appellant was liable to be exempted under the said Act,
although, the High Court did not express any opinion on the question whether the appellant was
exempted under Section 10(20) in that judgment.
51. After omission of Section 10(20-A), the only provision under which a body or authority can claim
exemption is Section 10(20). Local authority having been exhaustively defined in the Explanation to
Section 10(20) an entity has to fall under Section 10(20) to claim exemption. It is also useful to
notice that this Court laid down in State of Gujarat v. Essar Oil Ltd. [State of Gujarat v. Essar Oil
Ltd., (2012) 3 SCC 522 : (2012) 2 SCC (Civ) 182] that a person invoking an exception or an
exemption provision to relieve him of the tax liability must establish clearly that he is covered by the
said provision. It is useful to extract para 88 which is to the following effect: (SCC p. 547) ―88. This
Court in Novopan case [Novopan India Ltd. v. CCE, 1994 Supp (3) SCC 606] , held that the principle
that in case of ambiguity, a taxing statute should be construed in favour of the assessee, does not
apply to the construction of an exception or an exempting provision, as the same have to be
construed strictly. Further this Court also held that a person invoking an exception or an exemption
provision to relieve him of the tax liability must establish clearly that he is covered by the said
provision and in case of doubt or ambiguity, benefit of it must go to the State.(cid:129)
52. For interpreting an explanation this Court in S. Sundaram Pillai v. V.R. Pattabiraman [S.
Sundaram Pillai v. V.R. Pattabiraman, (1985) 1 SCC 591] , laid down in paras 47 and 53 as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 64M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
(SCC pp. 611 & 613) ―47. Swarup in Legislation and Interpretation very aptly sums up the scope and
effect of an Explanation thus:
‗Sometimes an Explanation is appended to stress upon a particular thing which
ordinarily would not appear clearly from the provisions of the section. The proper
function of an Explanation is to make plain or elucidate what is enacted in the
substantive provision and not to add or subtract from it. Thus an Explanation does
not either restrict or extend the enacting part; it does not enlarge or narrow down the
scope of the original section that it is supposed to explain.... The Explanation must be
interpreted according to its own tenor; that it is meant to explain and not vice versa.'
(pp. 297-98) ***
53. Thus, from a conspectus of the authorities referred to above, it is manifest that the object of an
Explanation to a statutory provision is--
‗(a) to explain the meaning and intendment of the Act itself,
(b) where there is any obscurity or vagueness in the main enactment, to clarify the same so as to
make it consistent with the dominant object which it seems to subserve,
(c) to provide an additional support to the dominant object of the Act in order to make it meaningful
and purposeful,
(d) an Explanation cannot in any way interfere with or change the enactment or any part thereof but
where some gap is left which is relevant for the purpose of the Explanation, in order to suppress the
mischief and advance the object of the Act it can help or assist the court in interpreting the true
purport and intendment of the enactment, and
(e) it cannot, however, take away a statutory right with which any person under a statute has been
clothed or set at naught the working of an Act by becoming a hindrance in the interpretation of the
same.'(cid:129)
53. This Court in Adityapur Industrial Area Development Authority [Adityapur Industrial Area
Development Authority v. Union of India, (2006) 5 SCC 100] after considering Section 10(20) as
amended by the Finance Act, 2002 and consequences of deletion of Section 10(20-A) has laid down
the following in para 13: (SCC p. 107) ―13. Applying the above test to the facts of the present case, it
is clear that the benefit, conferred by Section 10(20-A) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 on the assessee
herein, has been expressly taken away. Moreover, the Explanation added to Section 10(20)
enumerates the ―local authorities(cid:129) which do not cover the assessee herein. Therefore, we do not
find any merit in the submission advanced on behalf of the assessee.(cid:129)
54. It is also relevant to notice that this Court in Gujarat Industrial Development Corpn. v. CIT
[Gujarat Industrial Development Corpn. v. CIT, (1997) 7 SCC 17] , after considering the provisions of
Section 10(20-A) of the IT Act held that Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation is entitled for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 65M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
exemption under Section 10(20-A). The Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation was held to be
entitled for exemption under Section 10(20-A) at the time when the provision was in existence in
the statute book and after its deletion from the statute book the exemption is no more available.
Now, reverting back to Section 10(20) as amended by the Finance Act, 2002, the same has also
come for consideration before different High Courts. A Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court
in Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti v. Union of India [Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti v. Union of India,
2004 SCC OnLine All 2152 : (2004) 267 ITR 460] stated the following: (SCC OnLine All paras 7-10)
―7. A bare perusal of the Explanation to Section 10(20) shows that now only four entities are local
authorities for the purpose of Section 10(20), namely, (i) Panchayat; (ii) Municipality; (iii)
Municipal Committee and District Board; (iv) Cantonment Board. Krishi Utpadan Mandi Samiti is
not one of the entities mentioned in the Explanation to Section 10(20).
8. It may be noted that the Explanation to Section 10(20) uses the word ―means(cid:129) and not the word
―includes(cid:129). Hence, it is not possible for this Court to extend the definition of ―local authority(cid:129) as
contained in the Explanation to Section 10(20), vide P. Kasilingam v. P.S.G. College of Technology
[P. Kasilingam v. P.S.G. College of Technology, 1995 Supp (2) SCC 348, para 19 : AIR 1995 SC 1395,
para 19] . It is also not possible to refer to the definitions in other Acts, as the IT Act now specifically
defines ―local authority(cid:129).
9. It is well settled that in tax matters the literal rule of interpretation applies and it is not open to
the court to extend the language of a provision in the Act by relying on equity, inference, etc.
10. It is the first principle of interpretation that a statute should be read in its ordinary, natural and
grammatical sense. As observed by the Supreme Court of India:
‗22. ... In construing a statutory provision, the first and the foremost rule of
construction is the literary construction. All that [the Court has] to see at the very
outset is what does the provision say? If the provision is unambiguous and if from
that provision, the legislative intent is clear, [the Court] need not call into aid the
other rules of construction of statutes. The other rules of construction of statutes are
called into aid only when the legislative intent is not clear.' Vide HiralalRattanlal v.
State of U.P. [HiralalRattanlal v. State of U.P., (1973) 1 SCC 216 : 1973 SCC (Tax) 307
: AIR 1973 SC 1034] , SCC p. 224, para 22.(cid:129)
55. A Division Bench of the Delhi High Court also in Agricultural Produce Market
Committee v. CIT [Agricultural Produce Market Committee v. CIT, 2006 SCC OnLine
Del 1722 :
(2007) 294 ITR 549] had occasion to consider Section 10(20) as amended w.e.f.
1-4-2003 where the High Court in para 5 has stated the following: (SCC OnLine Del)
―5. The most striking feature of the Explanation is that the same provides an
exhaustive meaning to the expression ―local authority(cid:129). The word ―means(cid:129) used in
the Explanation leaves no scope for addition of any other entity as a ―local authority(cid:129)
to those enlisted in the Explanation. In other words, even if an entity constitutes a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 66M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
―local authority(cid:129) for purposes of the General Clauses Act, 1897, or for purposes of
any other enactment for that matter, it would not be so construed for purposes of
Section 10(20) of the Act unless it answers the description of one of those entities
enumerated in the Explanation.
Mrs Ahlawat did not make any attempt to bring her case under clauses (i), (ii) and (iv) of the
Explanation and, in our opinion, rightly so because the appellant Committee cannot by any process
of reasoning be construed as a Panchayat as referred to in clause (d) of Article 243 of the
Constitution of India, a municipality in terms of clause (e) of Article 243-P of the Constitution of
India or a Cantonment Board as defined under Section 3 of the Cantonments Act, 1924. What she
argued was that looking to the nature of the functions enjoined upon the appellant Committee, it
must be deemed to be a Municipal Committee within the meaning of that expression in clause
(iii) of the Explanation. We regret our inability to accept that submission. We say so for two distinct
reasons. Firstly, because the expression ―Municipal Committee(cid:129) appears in a taxing statute and
must, therefore, be construed strictly. It is fairly well settled by a long line of decisions rendered by
the Supreme Court that while interpreting a taxing statute, one has simply to look to what is clearly
stated therein. There is, in fiscal statutes, no room for any intendment nor is there any equity about
the levy sanctioned under the same. The following passage from Cape Brandy Syndicate v. IRC
[Cape Brandy Syndicate v. IRC, (1921) 1 KB 64] has been approved by the Apex Court in the
decisions rendered by their Lordships: (KB p. 71) ‗... in a taxing Act one has to look merely at what
is clearly said. There is no room for any intendment. There is no equity about a tax. There is no
presumption as to a tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied. One can only look fairly at
the language used.'(cid:129)
56. We fully endorse the views taken by the High Court in the above two judgments [Krishi Utpadan
Mandi Samiti v. Union of India, 2004 SCC OnLine All 2152 : (2004) 267 ITR 460] , [Agricultural
Produce Market Committee v. CIT, 2006 SCC OnLine Del 1722 : (2007) 294 ITR 549] .
57. Now, reverting back to the Explanation to Section 10(20), these are entities which mean the local
authority. The submission of the appellant is that the appellant is covered by clause (ii) of the
Explanation i.e. ―Municipality as referred to in clause (e) of Article 243-P of the Constitution(cid:129). We,
while discussing the above provisions, have already held that the appellant is not covered by the
word/expression of ―Municipality(cid:129) in clause (e) of Article 243-P. Thus, the appellant is not clearly
included in clause
(ii) of the Explanation. It is not even the case of the appellant that the appellant is covered by
Section 10(20) except clause (ii).
43. Proceeding to the facts of the case, Mr. Hossain pointed out that Form LC IV-D in unambiguous
terms provides for the EDC being paid to HSVP. The aforesaid clause as contained in the bilateral
agreement, according to Mr. Hossain, is incontrovertible proof of the obligation of the petitioner to
pay EDC to HSVP, albeit "through" the DTCP. In any event, according to learned counsel, the
payment of EDC is "not to"
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 67M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
the DTCP. It was submitted that the petitioners have at no stage questioned HSVP as
being the ultimate recipient of the EDC.
44. Learned counsel also questioned the reliance which was sought to be placed on the OM dated 06
October 2017 and contended that merely because the EDC payments were ultimately placed under a
‗receipt' head of the DTCP, the same does not detract from the payment having been made directly
to HSVP. According to Mr. Hossain how that payment is ultimately accounted for in the books of
HSVP and DTCP is an issue which is of little relevance or significance insofar as Section 194C is
concerned.
45. Mr. Hossain also questioned the correctness of the arguments and which were addressed on the
basis of the judgment of the Supreme Court in New Delhi Municipal Council. It was his submission
that the arguments addressed on this score were thoroughly misconceived since this is clearly not a
case where properties of the State were being sought to be taxed. In fact, according to learned
counsel, the decision of the Supreme Court is a resounding negation of the arguments addressed on
the anvil of Article 289 of the Constitution.
46. It was then submitted that a reading of the provisions of the 1977 Act would clearly point
towards statutory obligations placed upon HSVP to carry out external development work in
accordance with directives that may be issued by the DTCP and the Government of Haryana.
According to learned counsel, the aforesaid would clearly fall within the ambit of an agreement or an
arrangement between the DTCP and HSVP and would thus qualify the prerequisites of Section 194C.
Mr. Hossain pointed out that for the purposes of Section 194C it is not imperative that the payment
to the contractor be based on a written or explicit contract. According to learned counsel, the
existence of an agreement or an arrangement can always be gathered from the conduct of parties.
Viewed in that light, it was his submission that it would be apparent that the payments which were
made by the petitioners was for the carrying out of works pursuant to an agreement between the
contractor (HSVP) and a specified person (DTCP). In support of the aforenoted contention Mr.
Hossain laid reliance on the following pertinent observations as appearing in the decision of the
Supreme Court in Shree Choudhary Transport Company v. Income Tax Officer26:-
―15. In order to maintain that the appellant was under no obligation to make any
deduction of tax at source, it has been argued that there was no oral or written
contract of the appellant with the truck operators/owners, whose vehicles were
engaged to execute the work of transportation of the goods only on freelance and
need basis. The submission has been that the question of TDS under Section 194-C(2)
would have arisen only if the payment was made to a ―sub-contractor(cid:129) and that too,
in pursuance of a contract for the purpose of ―carrying whole or any part of work
undertaken by the contractor(cid:129). In our view, the submissions so made remain entirely
baseless.
15.1. The nature of contract entered into by the appellant with the consignor company
makes it clear that the appellant was to transport the goods (cement) of the consignor
company; and in order to execute this contract, the appellant hired the transport
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 68M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
vehicles, namely, the trucks from different operators/owners. The appellant received
freight charges from the consignor company, who indeed deducted tax at source
while making such payment to the appellant. Thereafter, the appellant paid the
charges to the persons whose vehicles were hired for the purpose of the said work of
transportation of goods. Thus, the goods in question were transported through the
trucks employed by the appellant but, there was no privity of contract between the
truck operators/owners and the said consignor company. Indisputably, it was the
responsibility of the appellant to transport the goods (cement) of the company; and
how to accomplish this task of transportation was a matter exclusively within the
domain of the appellant. Hence, hiring the services of truck operators/owners for this
purpose could have only been under a contract between the appellant and the said
truck operators/owners. Whether such a contract was reduced into writing or not
carries hardly any relevance. In the given scenario and set up, the said truck
operators/owners answered to the description of ―sub-contractor(cid:129) for carrying out
the whole or part of the work undertaken by the contractor (i.e. the appellant) for the
purpose of Section 194-C(2) of the Act.
15.2. The suggestions on behalf of the appellant that the said truck operators/owners
were not bound to supply the trucks as per the need of the appellant nor the freight
payable to them was pre-
determined, in our view, carry no meaning at all. Needless to (2021) 13 SCC 401 observe that if a
particular truck was not engaged, there existed no contract but, when any truck got engaged for the
purpose of execution of the work undertaken by the appellant and freight charges were payable to its
operator/owner upon execution of the work i.e. transportation of the goods, all the essentials of
making of a contract existed; and, as aforesaid, the said truck operator/owner became a
sub-contractor for the purpose of the work in question. The AO, CIT(A) and ITAT have concurrently
decided this issue against the appellant with reference to the facts of the case, particularly after
appreciating the nature of contract of the appellant with the consignor company as also the nature of
dealing of the appellant, while holding that the truck operators/owners were engaged by the
appellant as sub- contractors. The same findings have been endorsed by the High Court in its short
order [Shree Choudhary Transport Co. v. CIT, 2009 SCC OnLine Raj 5525 : (2009) 225 CTR 125]
dismissing the appeal of the appellant. We are unable to find anything of error or infirmity in these
findings.
15.3. The decision of the Delhi High Court in Hardarshan Singh [CIT v. Hardarshan Singh, 2013
SCC OnLine Del 128 :
(2013) 350 ITR 427] , in our view, has no application whatsoever to the facts of the
present case. The assessee therein, who was in the business of transporting goods,
had four trucks of his own and was also acting as a commission agent by arranging
for transportation through other transporters. As regards the income of assessee
relatable to transportation through other transporters, it was found that the assessee
had merely acted as a facilitator or as an intermediary between the two parties (i.e.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 69M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
the consignor company and the transporter) and had no privity of contract with
either of such parties inasmuch as he only collected freight charges from the clients
who intended to transport their goods through other transporters; and the amount
thus collected from the clients was paid to those transporters by the assessee while
deducting his commission. Looking to the nature of such dealings, the said assessee
was held to be ―not the person responsible(cid:129) for making payments in terms of Section
194-C of the Act and hence, having no obligation to deduct tax at source. In
contradistinction to the said case of Hardarshan Singh [CIT v. Hardarshan Singh,
2013 SCC OnLine Del 128 :
(2013) 350 ITR 427] , the appellant of the present case was not acting as a facilitator
or intermediary between the consignor company and the truck operators/owners
because those two parties had no privity of contract between them. The contract of
the company, for transportation of its goods, had only been with the appellant and it
was the appellant who hired the services of the trucks. The payment made by the
appellant to such a truck operator/owner was clearly a payment made to a
sub-contractor.
15.4. Though the decision of this Court in Palam Gas Service [Palam Gas Service v. CIT, (2017) 7
SCC 613 : (2017) 394 ITR 300] essentially relates to the interpretation of Section 40(a)(i-a) of the
Act and while the relevant aspects concerning the said provision shall be examined in the next
question but, for the present purpose, the facts of that case could be usefully noticed, for being akin
to the facts of the present case and being of apposite illustration. Therein, the assessee was engaged
in the business of purchase and sale of LPG cylinders whose main contract for carriage of LPG
cylinders was with Indian Oil Corporation, Baddi wherefor, the assessee received freight payments
from the principal. The assessee got the transportation of LPG done through three persons to whom
he made the freight payments. The assessing officer held that the assessee had entered into a
sub-contract with the said three persons within the meaning of Section 194-C of the Act. Such
findings of AO were concurrently upheld up to the High Court and, after interpretation of Section
40(a)(i-a), this Court also approved the decision [Palam Gas Service v. CIT, 2014 SCC OnLine HP
2388 : (2015) 370 ITR 740] of the High Court while dismissing the appeal with costs. The learned
counsel for the appellant has made an attempt to distinguish the nature of contract in Palam Gas
Service [Palam Gas Service v. CIT, (2017) 7 SCC 613 : (2017) 394 ITR 300] by suggesting that
therein, the assessee's sub-contractors were specific and identified persons with whom the assessee
had entered into contract whereas the present appellant was free to hire the service of any truck
operator/owner and, in fact, the appellant hired the trucks only on need basis. In our view, such an
attempt of differentiation is totally baseless and futile. Whether the appellant had specific and
identified trucks on its rolls or had been picking them up on freelance basis, the legal effect on the
status of parties had been the same that once a particular truck was engaged by the appellant on hire
charges for carrying out the part of work undertaken by it (i.e. transportation of the goods of the
company), the operator/owner of that truck became the sub- contractor and all the requirements of
Section 194-C came into operation.(cid:129) 15.5. Thus, we have no hesitation in affirming the concurrent
findings in regard to the applicability of Section 194-C to the present case. Question 1 is, therefore,
answered in the negative; against the appellant assessee and in favour of the Revenue.(cid:129)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 70M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
47. We at the outset note that Mr. Hossain apart from addressing submissions noticed hereinbefore
had also raised an objection to the maintainability of the writ petitions asserting that orders passed
under Section 201 are appealable under the provisions of the Act. It was his submission, therefore,
that these writ petitions should be dismissed on this score. We, however, find ourselves unable to
sustain that objection bearing in mind the undisputed fact that most of these writ petitions were
entertained as far back as in 2019 and 2021 and on which, and after hearing counsels for respective
sides, the Court had entertained the writ petitions and passed interim orders. It would thus be
wholly inequitable to relegate parties to pursue an alternative remedy. We additionally note from
the initial orders passed on these writ petitions, that an objection to their maintainability in the face
of an alternative remedy does not appear to have been raised or addressed in the first instance. In
any case and since parties have addressed submissions at great length on the merits of the questions
which arise and the jurisdictional challenge that stands raised, we find no justification to accept the
objection as is raised.
48. As was clarified by us in the prefatory parts of this judgment, we propose to decide and rule
upon the applicability of Section 194C of the Act principally and leave it open for the writ petitioners
as well as the respondents to proceed further in respect of notices that may have been issued
referable to Sections 201 and Section 271C of the Act in accordance with the present judgment. We
shall also while examining the challenge which stands raised deal with an additional ground which
has been urged in some of the writ petitions and which had questioned the validity of the show cause
notices not even referring to the appropriate provision comprised in Chapter XVII-B which was
sought to be invoked and thus asserting that those notices are liable to be quashed on the ground of
lacking in material particulars and being wholly vague.
49. The principal question which stands raised would have to be answered on an understanding of
the scope the scope and ambit of Section 194C. We at the outset note that the aforesaid provision
places an obligation on any person responsible for paying a sum to any resident for carrying out any
work pursuant to a contract between the resident and a specified person, to deduct tax at source at
the time of crediting such sum to the account of the resident or at the time of payment. The resident,
who is envisaged to have a contract with a specified person, is referred to in that provision as the
―contractor(cid:129). The liability to deduct tax, on an ex facie reading of Section 194C, stands attracted at
the time of payment of any sum or the credit thereof to the account of the contractor. The existence
of a contract which is spoken of in Section 194C is between the contractor and a specified person.
The provision thus does not construct a contractual relationship between the person responsible for
paying the sum and deducting tax with the contractor as a precondition. This is clearly not a
prerequisite for Section 194C being attracted. For the purposes of Section 194C, all that is required is
a payment being effected to a contractor who has a contractual relationship with a specified person.
50. HSVP, according to the respondents, has an arrangement with the Government of Haryana to
undertake external development work. Undisputedly the Government of Haryana, by virtue of being
the State Government, would fall within the meaning of the expression ‗specified person' as per the
Explanation appended to Section 194C. The critical question which thus arises is whether the
arrangement between HSVP and the Government of Haryana could be said to fall within the
meaning of the phrase ―in pursuance of a contract(cid:129) as occurring in that provision.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 71M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
51. The HDRUA Act in Section 2(g) defines EDC to include all infrastructure development work,
such as water supply, sewerage, drains, treatment and disposal of sewage, storm water, roads,
electrical works and other activities including those which may be additionally specified by the
Director, to be executed in the periphery or outside a colony or an area for the benefit thereof. A
‗colony' has been defined in Section 2(c) to mean an area of land divided or proposed to be divided
into plots for residential, commercial, industrial development or for the establishment of a
cyber-city, cyber-park, integrated commercial complexes or for construction of flats in a group
housing project or for creation of a low density eco-friendly colony. Section 3(3)(a)(ii) casts an
obligation upon an owner/ applicant to pay proportionate development charges if its external
development work is to be carried out by the Government or any other local authority. The aforesaid
statutory obligation as placed is again reiterated in Rule 11(1)(c) and which requires the applicant to
submit an undertaking agreeing to pay proportionate development charges if activities comprised in
external development are to be constructed, developed and undertaken by the Government or other
local authority. The aforesaid obligation again finds specific mention in Form LC IV-D, which is the
bilateral agreement that the applicant has to execute with the DTCP. Clause 1(ii) of Form LC IV-D
stipulates that the proportionate EDC is to be paid to HSVP through the DTCP within 30 days from
the date of grant of the licence or in ten equal six monthly instalments as per the schedule
prescribed therein. The bilateral agreement clearly places the owner/developer under an unerring
obligation to pay EDC to the HSVP.
52. The 1977 Act came to be promulgated with the avowed objective of establishing HSVP for
undertaking urban development and for it to act as a local development authority for the
development of local areas in the State of Haryana. The expression ―amenities(cid:129) and ―basic
amenities(cid:129) are defined therein in the following terms:
―(a) amenity" includes roads, water supply, street lighting, drainage, [sewerage,
treatment and disposal of sewage, sullage and storm water] Public works, tourist
spots, open spaces, Parks, landscaping and Play fields, and such other conveniences
as the State Government may, by notification, specify to be an amenity for the
purposes of this Act;
(ai) "basic amenities" include metalled roads, wholesome water, sewerage and
electrification;(cid:129)
53. The objects of HSVP are set out in Section 13 of the 1977 Act and which explains it to include the
promotion and securing the development of all or any of the areas comprised in an urban area. By
virtue of Section 21, HSVP is enjoined to create and maintain a fund to which, amongst others,
would be credited all monies received by it from the State Government or the Central Government
by way of grants, loans, advances ―or otherwise(cid:129). The aforesaid fund is liable to be applied towards
meeting expenditure for development of land and for such other purposes as the State Government
might direct or permit. Section 21 of the 1977 Act reads as follows:
―(21). Fund of authority (1) the authority shall have and maintain its own fund to
which shall be credited -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 72M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
(a) all moneys received by the authority from the State Government and the Central
Government by way of grants, loans, advances or otherwise;
(b) all moneys borrowed by the authority from source other than the Government, by
way of loans or debentures;
(c) all fees received by the authority under this Act;
(d) all moneys received by the authority from the disposal of lands, building and
other properties, movable and immovable; and
(e) all moneys received by the authority by way of rents and profits or in any other
manner or from any other source. (2) The fund shall be applied towards meeting-
(a) expenditure incurred in the administration of this Act;
(b) cost of acquisition of land for purposes of this Act;
(c) expenditure for development of land;
(d) expenditure for such other purposes as the State Government may direct or
permit.
(3) The authority shall keep its fund in any Scheduled Bank. (4) The authority may
invest any portion of its fund in such securities or in such other manner as may be
prescribed. (5) The income resulting from investments mentioned in sub-
section (4) and proceeds of the sale of the same shall be credited to the fund of the authority.(cid:129)
54. Apart from the above, Section 22 of the 1977 Act recognizes the power of the State Government
to provide grants, advances and loans to the HSVP as it may consider necessary to enable it to
discharge its functions under the Act. Section 22 reads as follows:
―22. Power of State Government to make grants, advances and loans to authority
- The State Government may make such grants, advances and loans to the authority
as the State Government may deem necessary, for the performance of the functions
under this Act and all grants, loans and advances so made shall be on such terms and
conditions, as the State Government may determine.(cid:129)
55. Section 30 then places HSVP under a binding obligation to carry out such directions as may be
issued to it from time to time by the State Government. The 1977 Act thus clearly envisages HSVP as
being an authority which is charged with undertaking external development works in all areas
falling within an urban area. The authority thus appears to have been constituted as a specialised
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 73M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
agency which would carry out external development works in colonies and areas. A statutory
obligation to carry out external development, thus, cannot possibly be doubted.
56. Of critical significance is the communication of the DTCP dated 19 June 2018. A reading of that
communication evidences an acknowledgement by that authority of HSVP undertaking external
development work in and around a colony/ area. The aforesaid communication also admits to an
arrangement which was in existence upto 31 March 2017 in terms of which the DTCP used to collect
EDC from colonisers in the shape of a bank draft drawn in favour of and sent to HSVP. The
communication further asserts that HSVP is thus an executing agency working for and on behalf of
the State Government for carrying out external development works for which funds are provided to
HSVP through the DTCP.
57. In para 4 of this communication, the DTCP discloses that since receipts on account of EDC were
found to be insufficient to bear the cost of development work, it had formulated a new scheme and
for which appropriate budgetary provisions were made for execution of all external development
works by it. It was on the promulgation of the aforesaid scheme titled as the ―Swarn Jyanti Haryana
Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme(cid:129) that EDC w.e.f. FY 2017-18 was deposited directly with
the State Government and constituted a part of the Consolidated Fund of that State. It is further
admitted that it was post the promulgation of that scheme and the issuance of an order dated 12
May 2017 that all payments towards EDC were made online through the State Government's
e-payment gateway or in the shape of demand drafts favouring the DTCP. It is further averred that
the required funds for execution of development works were thereafter released to HSVP upon
sanction being granted by the Finance Department of the Government of Haryana. This
communication is thus evidence of all EDC charges being made over to the HSVP at least prior to 31
March 2017 pursuant to an understanding that those funds would be utilised towards external
development. Undisputedly, EDC charges, which form the subject matter of the present batch were
payments made directly to HSVP and prior to FY 2017-18.
58. As we read the communication of 19 June 2018, it becomes manifest that all payments were
made to HSVP albeit under the directives of the DTCP. Those payments clearly appear to be directed
towards subserving an arrangement existing between HSVP and the Government of Haryana for
external development work being carried out by the former. While it is true that this arrangement
does not stand encapsulated in a formally executed contract or instrument, there clearly appears to
be in existence an understanding between the State Government and HSVP for external
development work being executed by it and for the funds remitted to it being utilized for the said
purposes. It is in the aforesaid context that the decision of the Supreme Court in Shree Chaudhary
Transport assumes significance.
59. As is manifest from the passages of that decision extracted hereinabove, Section 194C was
explained to embody an obligation on the person responsible to make a payment to a sub-contractor
being liable to deduct tax at source. The Supreme Court held that an underlying contract which
could otherwise be discerned from the arrangement between parties and their conduct would be
sufficient even though it may not have been reduced in writing. The arrangement and conduct of
parties led the Supreme Court to hold and observe that since the hiring of the sub-contractor was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 74M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
only for the purposes of fulfilling the principal contract which the appellant had with the specified
person, the provisions of Section 194C were satisfied. It was thus the conduct of parties which led to
the Supreme Court coming to the conclusion that all essentials of the creation and existence of a
contract existed.
60. In the facts of the present case, and as we construe the provisions of the HDRUA read along with
the Rules as also the statutory obligations placed upon HSVP, it becomes apparent that there was in
existence an understanding or an arrangement between HSVP and the Government of Haryana for
the execution of external development works. The phrase ―in pursuance of a contract(cid:129) as finding
place in Section 194C would have to necessarily be construed bearing in mind the salient principles
which were propounded by the Supreme Court in Shree Chaudhary Transport. If the existence of a
contract were to be gleaned from the arrangement which existed between HSVP and the
Government of Haryana and is also duly acknowledged by the DTCP itself, the absence of a written
or codified agreement would not be relevant for the purposes of Section 194C being applicable.
61. We further note that not only the provisions of the HDRUA but also the forms and bilateral
agreements executed by the applicants, mandated that all payments of EDC were to be drawn in
favour of HSVP. Although they were routed through the DTCP, those payments undoubtedly were to
the account of HSVP. The statute as well as the licence conditions thus placed the petitioners under
a binding obligation to advance all EDC payments in favour of HSVP. The aforesaid clearly qualifies
the responsibility which Section 194C places upon a payer who is contemplating making payments
to a contractor.
62. The submission of a lack of privity between the writ petitioners and HSVP is noticed only to be
rejected since Section 194C does not contemplate the existence of a contractual relationship between
a person who is responsible for paying a sum and the contractor as defined in that provision. The
existence of a contract is only envisaged to be a factor pertinent to an arrangement which the
contractor may have with a specified person. Thus merely because EDC is determined and directed
to be paid by the DTCP, the same does not deprive the payment of its intrinsic characteristic,
namely, of being a payment made to HSVP.
63. In our considered opinion the fact that EDC is determined, computed or is recoverable by the
DTCP is wholly inconsequential since Section 194C is solely concerned with a payment being made
to a contractor who has an arrangement with a specified person. Merely because an exercise of
quantification is undertaken by the specified person, the same would have no bearing on the
applicability of Section 194C. We would thus be of the opinion that the moment the petitioners
effected a payment in favour of HSVP in connection with the external development work which was
to be executed by it pursuant to the arrangement that existed between the said entity and the State
Government, the provisions of Section 194C stood attracted.
64. It is also pertinent to note that Chapter XVII-B, and more particularly Section 190 thereof,
commences with a non-obstante clause and thus places a responsibility upon a person effecting a
payment which is taxable under the provisions of the Act to deduct and collect tax at source in
accordance with the provisions placed in that Chapter. The aforesaid provisions except in certain
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 75M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
contingencies and in respect of certain category of payments, does not confer any discretion in a
person effecting payment to consider whether tax is liable to be deducted and collected at source. It
is only in certain contingencies, such as those which are spoken of in Section 195, that the statute
enables the person responsible for effecting a payment to consider whether the amount sought to be
paid would be income chargeable under the Act. This is evident from Section 195 which is extracted
hereunder:
―195. Other sums.--((1) Any person responsible for paying to a non-resident, not
being a company, or to a foreign company, [any interest (not being interest referred
to in Section 194-LB or Section 194-LC) [or Section 194-LD]] [* * *] or any other sum
chargeable under the provisions of this Act (not being income chargeable under the
head ―Salaries(cid:129) [* * *] shall, at the time of credit of such income to the account of the
payee or at the time of payment thereof in cash or by the issue of a cheque or draft or
by any other mode, whichever is earlier, deduct income tax thereon at the rates in
force:
Provided that in the case of interest payable by the Government or a public sector
bank within the meaning of clause (23-D) of Section 10 or a public financial
institution within the meaning of that clause, deduction of tax shall be made only at
the time of payment thereof in cash or by the issue of a cheque or draft or by any
other mode:
[* * *] [Explanation-1].--For the purposes of this section, where any interest or other
sum as aforesaid is credited to any account, whether called ―Interest payable
account(cid:129) or ―Suspense account(cid:129) or by any other name, in the books of account of the
person liable to pay such income, such crediting shall be deemed to be credit of such
income to the account of the payee and the provisions of this section shall apply
accordingly. [Explanation 2.--For the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that the
obligation to comply with sub-section (1) and to make deduction thereunder applies
and shall be deemed to have always applied and extends and shall be deemed to have
always extended to all persons, resident or non-resident, whether or not the
non-resident person has--
(i) a residence or place of business or business connection in India; or
(ii) any other presence in any manner whatsoever in India. (2) Where the person
responsible for paying any such sum chargeable under this Act, [(other than salary)]
to a non-resident considers that the whole of such sum would not be income
chargeable in the case of the recipient, he may make an application [in such form and
manner to the Assessing Officer, to determine in such manner, as may be prescribed],
the appropriate proportion of such sum so chargeable, and upon such determination,
tax shall be deducted under sub-section (1) only on that proportion of the sum which
is so chargeable: [* * *] (3) Subject to rules made under sub-section (5), any person
entitled to receive any interest or other sum on which income tax has to be deducted
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 76M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
under sub-section (1) may make an application in the prescribed form to the
Assessing Officer for the grant of a certificate authorising him to receive such interest
or other sum without deduction of tax under that sub-section, and where any such
certificate is granted, every person responsible for paying such interest or other sum
to the person to whom such certificate is granted shall, so long as the certificate is in
force, make payment of such interest or other sum without deducting tax thereon
under sub-section (1). (4) A certificate granted under sub-section (3) shall remain in
force till the expiry of the period specified therein or, if it is cancelled by the
Assessing Officer before the expiry of such period, till such cancellation.
(5) The Board may, having regard to the convenience of assessees and the interests of
revenue, by notification in the Official Gazette, make rules specifying the cases in
which, and the circumstances under which, an application may be made for the grant
of a certificate under sub-section (3) and the conditions subject to which such
certificate may be granted and providing for all other matters connected therewith.
(6) The person responsible for paying to a non-resident, not being a company, or to a
foreign company, any sum, whether or not chargeable under the provisions of this
Act, shall furnish the information relating to payment of such sum, in such form and
manner, as may be prescribed.
(7) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1) and sub-section (2), the
Board may, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify a class of persons or cases,
where the person responsible for paying to a non-resident, not being a company, or
to a foreign company, any sum, whether or not chargeable under the provisions of
this Act, shall make an application 3636[in such form and manner to the Assessing
Officer, to determine in such manner, as may be prescribed], the appropriate
proportion of sum chargeable, and upon such determination, tax shall be deducted
under sub-section (1) on that proportion of the sum which is so chargeable.(cid:129)
65. The special character of that section and others similar thereto and which speak of ―income
chargeable(cid:129) was noticed by the Supreme Court in Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellence Private
Limited v. Commissioner of Income Tax and Anr.27. We deem it apposite to extract paras 27 to 31 of
that decision hereunder:
―27. The learned Additional Solicitor General further pointed out that the Indian
Government had expressed its reservations on the OECD Commentary, especially on
the parts of the OECD Commentary dealing with the parting of copyright and royalty.
He also relied upon the Report of the High-Powered Committee on ―Electronic
Commerce and Taxation(cid:129) constituted by the CBDT, [ F. No 500/122/99 dated
16-12-1999] [―HPC Report 2003(cid:129)] and the Report of the Committee on the Taxation
of E- Commerce [―E-Commerce Report 2016(cid:129)], which proposed an equalisation levy
on specified transactions. He then went on to rely on certain judgments to state that
even if the OECD Commentary could be relied upon, it being a rule of international
law contrary to domestic law, to the extent it was contrary to Explanations 2 and 4 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 77M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
Section 9(1)(vi) of the Income Tax Act, it must give way to domestic law. Referring to
the doctrine of first sale/principle of exhaustion, he cited a number of judgments in
order to show that under Section 14(b)(ii) of the Copyright Act, this doctrine cannot
be said to apply insofar as distributors are concerned.
28. The learned Additional Solicitor General finally concluded his arguments by
stating that the judgments which deal with computer software under sales tax law
and excise law have no relevance to income tax law, as the laws relating to indirect
taxes are fundamentally different from the laws relating to direct taxes, since they
must follow the drill of the chargeability under the Income Tax Act, which is different
from chargeability under sales tax law or excise law.
29. Having heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of various parties, we first
set out the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act that we are directly concerned
with:
―2. Definitions.--In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires--

Provided that, in the case of a person not ordinarily resident in India within the
meaning of sub-section (6) of Section 6, the income which accrues or arises to him
outside India shall not be so included unless it is derived from a business controlled
in or a profession set up in India. (2) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the total
income of any previous year of a person who is a non-resident includes all income

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 82M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
(i) a residence or place of business or business connection in India; or

Finance Act, 2003 (32 of 2003), Section 80(b) (w.e.f. 1-6-2003).] (other than salary)
to a non-resident considers that the whole of such sum would not be income
chargeable in the case of the recipient, he may make an application in such form and
manner to the assessing officer, to determine in such manner, as may be prescribed,
the appropriate proportion of such sum so chargeable, and upon such determination,
tax shall be deducted under sub-section (1) only on that proportion of the sum which
is so chargeable.
***
201. Consequences of failure to deduct or pay.--(1) Where any person, including the principal officer
of a company--
(a) who is required to deduct any sum in accordance with the provisions of this Act; or
(b) referred to in sub-section (1-A) of Section 192, being an employer, does not deduct, or does not
pay, or after so deducting fails to pay, the whole or any part of the tax, as required by or under this
Act, then, such person, shall, without prejudice to any other consequences which he may incur, be
deemed to be an assessee in default in respect of such tax:
Provided that any person, including the principal officer of a company, who fails to
deduct the whole or any part of the tax in accordance with the provisions of this
Chapter on the sum paid to a payee or on the sum credited to the account of a payee
shall not be deemed to be an assessee in default in respect of such tax if such payee--
(i) has furnished his return of income under Section 139;
(ii) has taken into account such sum for computing income in such return of income;
and
(iii) has paid the tax due on the income declared by him in such return of income, and
the person furnishes a certificate to this effect from an accountant in such form as
may be prescribed:
Provided further that no penalty shall be charged under Section 221 from such
person, unless the assessing officer is satisfied that such person, without good and
sufficient reasons, has failed to deduct and pay such tax.(cid:129)
30. The scheme of the Income Tax Act, insofar as the question raised before us is
concerned, is that for income to be taxed under the Income Tax Act, residence in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 83M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
India, as defined by Section 6, is necessary in most cases. By Section 4(1), income tax
shall be charged for any assessment year at any rate or rates, as defined by Section
2(37-A) of the Income Tax Act, in respect of the total income of the previous year of
every person. Under Section 4(2), in respect of income chargeable under sub-section
(1) thereof, income tax shall be deducted at source or paid in advance, depending
upon the provisions of the Income Tax Act.
Importantly, under Section 5(2) of the Income Tax Act, the total income of a person who is a
non-resident, includes all income from whatever source derived, which accrues or arises or is
deemed to accrue or arise to such person in India during such year. This, however, is subject to the
provisions of the Income Tax Act. Certain income is deemed to arise or accrue in India, under
Section 9 of the Income Tax Act, notwithstanding the fact that such income may accrue or arise to a
non-resident outside India. One such income is income by way of royalty, which, under Section
9(1)(vi) of the Income Tax Act, means the transfer of all or any rights, including the granting of a
licence, in respect of any copyright in a literary work.
31. That such transaction may be governed by a DTAA is then recognised by Section 5(2) read with
Section 90 of the Income Tax Act, making it clear that the Central Government may enter into any
such agreement with the Government of another country so as to grant relief in respect of income
tax chargeable under the Income Tax Act or under any corresponding law in force in that foreign
country, or for the avoidance of double taxation of income under the Income Tax Act and under the
corresponding law in force in that country. What is of importance is that once a DTAA applies, the
provisions of the Income Tax Act can only apply to the extent that they are more beneficial to the
assessee and not otherwise. Further, by Explanation 4 to Section 90 of the Income Tax Act, it has
been clarified by Parliament that where any term is defined in a DTAA, the definition contained in
the DTAA is to be looked at. It is only where there is no such definition that the definition in the
Income Tax Act can then be applied. This position has been recognised by this Court in Azadi
BachaoAndolan [Union of India v. Azadi BachaoAndolan, (2004) 10 SCC 1] , which held : (SCC pp.
25 & 27, paras 21 & 28) ―21. The provisions of Sections 4 and 5 of the Act are expressly made
―subject to the provisions of this Act(cid:129), which would include Section 90 of the Act. As to what would
happen in the event of a conflict between the provision of the Income Tax Act and a notification
issued under Section 90, is no longer res integra.
***
28. A survey of the aforesaid cases makes it clear that the judicial consensus in India has been that
Section 90 is specifically intended to enable and empower the Central Government to issue a
notification for implementation of the terms of a Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement. When that
happens, the provisions of such an agreement, with respect to cases to which they apply, would
operate even if inconsistent with the provisions of the Income Tax Act. We approve of the reasoning
in the decisions which we have noticed. If it was not the intention of the legislature to make a
departure from the general principle of chargeability to tax under Section 4 and the general
principle of ascertainment of total income under Section 5 of the Act, then there was no purpose in
making those sections ―subject to the provisions of the Act(cid:129). The very object of grafting the said two
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 84M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
sections with the said clause is to enable the Central Government to issue a notification under
Section 90 towards implementation of the terms of DTACs which would automatically override the
provisions of the Income Tax Act in the matter of ascertainment of chargeability to income tax and
ascertainment of total income, to the extent of inconsistency with the terms of DTAC.(cid:129) Unlike those
provisions finding place in Chapter XVII-B, and which require a person responsible for effecting a
payment to examine whether the sum is chargeable under the provisions of the Act, Section 194C
places no such discretion or leeway in the hands of the person responsible for paying a sum to a
contractor.
66. We further take note of the significant provisions contained in Sections 197 and 197A of the Act,
and which are reproduced hereinbelow:
―197. Certificate for deduction at lower rate.--(1) Subject to the rules made under
sub-section (2-A), [where, in the case of any income of any person [or sum payable to

deliver or cause to be delivered to the [Principal Chief Commissioner or Chief Commissioner] or
[Principal Commissioner or Commissioner] one copy of the declaration referred to in sub-section (1)
[or sub-section (1- A)] [or sub-section (1-C)] on or before the seventh day of the month next
following the month in which the declaration is furnished to him.(cid:129)
67. The liability to deduct tax as would be evident from the aforenoted provisions, stands effaced
only if a recipient obtains a certificate of exemption or where a beneficiary produces a certificate
which obliges the payer to deduct tax at a rate lower than that prescribed. HSVP had obtained no
certification as contemplated in terms of the aforenoted provisions nor had it obtained a declaration
that moneys received by it were exempt from tax. In view of the aforesaid, it is apparent that the writ
petitioners did not stand absolved of the obligation to deduct tax on payments that were being made
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 86M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
to HSVP.
68. That takes us further to consider the submission which was addressed in the context of Section
196 of the Act. The submission essentially was that since payments being made to HSVP were
pursuant to the directives of the DTCP and in aid of external development work being carried out,
those payments should be viewed as sums which were payable to the Government of Haryana. It was
in this context submitted that all aspects pertaining to EDC were regulated by the DTCP. The
petitioners urged that the determination and quantification of EDC were subjects exclusively
regulated by directives of the DTCP. The petitioners also referred to the power vested in the DTCP to
initiate proceedings for recovery of EDC as arrears of revenue and thus constituting a statutory
impost exempt from taxation. It was in the backdrop that the petitioners urged us to accept EDC
payments as falling within Section 196. We find ourselves unable to sustain that submission bearing
in mind the indubitable position which emerges from the discussion which ensues.
69. Section 196 frees sums payable to the Government, RBI or a corporation established by or under
a Central Act from the obligation of tax being collected at source. Undisputedly, HSVP would neither
fall within the ambit of clause (1) or clause (3) of Section 196. The mere fact that HSVP has been
constituted under a statutory enactment does not make it the ―Government(cid:129). Even if it were
discharging functions akin to or similar to governmental obligations or performing activities closely
connected with State functions, the same would not result in us recognising HSVP as the
Government.
70. This issue, in our considered opinion, stands conclusively answered against the writ petitioners
by Adityapur Industrial Area. The said decision eloquently explains the distinction which is liable to
be borne in mind between a sovereign government and a statutory authority. Quoting from Basu's
Commentary on the Constitution of India, the Supreme Court noted that it is the property of the
State which alone is immune from taxation under Article 289 of the Constitution.
Dealing more specifically with the case of a statutory corporation, it took note of the judgment in
A.P. SRTC v. ITO28 and observed thus: -
"14. In A.P. SRTC v. ITO [(1964) 7 SCR 17 : AIR 1964 SC 1486] the question arose as
to whether the income derived from trading activity by the Andhra Pradesh Road
Transport Corporation established under the Road Transport Corporation Act, 1950
was not the income of the State of Andhra Pradesh within the meaning of Article
289(1) of the Constitution and hence exempted from Union taxation. This Court
considered the scheme of Article 289 and observed as follows: (SCR p. 25) ―The
scheme of Article 289 appears to be that ordinarily, the income derived by a State
both from governmental and non-governmental or commercial activities shall be
immune from income tax levied by the Union, provided, of course, the income in
question can be said to be the income of the State. This general proposition flows
from clause (1).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 87M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
Clause (2) then provides an exception and authorises the Union to impose a tax in
respect of the income derived by the Government of a State from trade or business
carried on by it, or on its behalf; that is to say, the income from trade or business
carried on by the Government of a State or on its behalf which would not have been
taxable under clause (1), can be taxed, provided a law is made by Parliament in that
behalf. If clause (1) had stood by itself, it may not have been easy to include within its
purview income derived by a State from commercial activities, but since clause (2), in
terms, empowers Parliament to make a law levying a tax on commercial activities
carried on by or on behalf of a State, the conclusion is inescapable that these activities
were deemed to have been included in clause (1) and that alone can be the
justification for the words in which clause (2) has been adopted by the Constitution.
It is plain that clause (2) proceeds on the basis that but for its provision, the trading
activity which is covered by it would have claimed exemption from Union taxation
under clause (1). That is the result of reading clauses (1) and (2) together.
Clause (3) then empowers Parliament to declare by law that any trade or business
would be taken out of the purview of clause (2) and restored to the area covered by
clause (1) by declaring that the said trade or business is incidental to the ordinary
functions of the Government. In other words, clause (3) is an exception to the
exception (1964) 7 SCR 17 prescribed by clause (2). Whatever trade or business is
declared to be incidental to the ordinary functions of the Government, would cease to
be governed by clause (2) and would then be exempt from Union taxation. That,
broadly stated, appears to be the result of the scheme adopted by the three clauses of
Article 289.(cid:129)
71. In A.P. SRTC, the Supreme Court had held that a statutory corporation has a personality distinct
and separate from that of the State or its shareholders. This would thus appear to lend credence to
the stand of the respondents who had argued that even if HSVP be funded by the State Government,
it would continue to remain a legal entity separate from the State Government. We are also
unimpressed by the argument that since the payment was made on the directives of the DTCP, it
should be treated as falling within the scope of Section 196 of the Act. It becomes pertinent to note
that Section 196 is not dependent upon a directive to pay. It is concerned solely with whether the
payment is made to a Government or an authority specified therein. Similarly, the fact that arrears
of EDC could be recovered as arrears of land revenue is also wholly immaterial. Section 10A is
merely a mode of recovery of EDC. Even if that provision were to elevate EDC to a statutory levy, the
same would not be determinative of whether the payment falls within the scope of Section 196. The
applicability of Section 196 is not liable to be answered on the basis of whether the amount has a
statutory hue. The amount paid would be exempt from the rigours of TDS only if it is made to a
category of entities specified therein.
72. Ultimately, the question which warrants consideration is whether EDC was a payment to the
State. This must necessarily be answered in the negative bearing in mind the undisputed fact that
the income was placed in the hands and at the disposal of HSVP. We note that undisputedly at least
till 31 March 2017 all EDC payments even as per the DTCP were being made out in favour of HSVP.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 88M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
It is only thereafter that EDC was deposited with the DTCP. This too leads us to the irresistible
conclusion that the payments made to HSVP would not fall within Section 196.
73. We also bear in mind the unambiguous legislative command of Section 194C which places the
payer under the unshirkable obligation of deducting tax from all payments being made to a
contractor. We have already noticed in the preceding parts of this decision that Section 194C of the
Act vests no discretion in the payer to examine or contemplate chargeability of that payment to tax.
We, in this connection, note the following pertinent observations as rendered by the Supreme Court
in Associated Cement Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax29.
―7. The above decision cannot be of any help to the appellant for it does not lay down that the
percentage amount deductible under Section 194-C(1) should be out of the income of the contractor
from the sum or sums credited to the account of or paid to him. The words in the sub-section ‗on
income comprised therein' appearing immediately after the words ‗deduct an amount equal to two
per cent of such sum as income tax' from their purport, cannot be understood as the percentage
amount deductible from the income of the contractor out of the sum credited to his account or paid
to him in pursuance of the contract. Moreover, the concluding part of the sub-section requiring
deduction of an amount equal to two per cent of such sum as income tax, by use of the words ‗on
income comprised therein' makes it obvious that the amount equal to two per cent of the sum
required to be deducted is a deduction at source. Indeed, it is neither possible nor permissible to the
payer to determine what part of the amount paid by him to the contractor constitutes the income of
the latter. It is not also possible to think that the Parliament could have intended to cast such
impossible burden upon the payer nor could it be attributed with the intention of enacting such an
impractical and unworkable provision. Hence, on the express language employed in the sub-section,
it is impossible to hold that the amount of two per cent required to be deducted by the payer out of
the sum credited to the account of or paid to the contractor has (1993) 2 SCC 556 to be confined to
his income component out of that sum. There is also nothing in the language of the sub-section
which permits exclusion of an amount paid on behalf of the organisation to the contractor according
to Clause 13 of the terms and conditions of the contract in reimbursement of the amount paid by
him to workers, from the sum envisaged(cid:129) We thus find ourselves unable to sustain the challenge as
raised.
74. In light of the foregoing discussion and for reasons set out hereinabove, we find ourselves unable
to concur with the view taken by the Tribunal in Santur, Satya, Perfect Constech and Spaze Tower.
Those decisions have proceeded on the basis of a contractual obligation between the petitioner and
HSVP being a prerequisite. They have additionally based their decision on the fact that HSVP was
undertaking external development work on the directives of the DTCP. These, for reasons recorded
hereinabove, were factors wholly irrelevant for the purposes of considering the applicability of
Section 194C.
75. That only leaves to consider some of the supplemental questions which were raised and which
included the Show Cause Notices not specifically adverting to the specific provision contained in
Chapter XVIIB and in terms of which the petitioners were held liable to deduct tax. We, in this
regard, also bear in consideration the two earlier rounds of litigation when in the first instance the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 89M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
respondents had sought to hold the petitioners liable to deduct tax under Section 194 in the case of
BPTP and subsequently under Section 194I as is evident from the judgment rendered in DLF Homes
Panchkula.
76. We are of the firm opinion that in matters pertaining to taxation we would not readily import the
principle of a power otherwise inhering being sufficient for the purposes of examining the validity of
a Show Cause Notice. Chapter XVII-B embodies Sections 192 to 206AB and refers to various
contingencies and situations where a payer is bound in law to deduct tax. The respondents were thus
clearly obliged to indicate with sufficient clarity the specific statutory provision contained in Chapter
XVII-B and which according to them placed an obligation on the petitioners to deduct tax. This
aspect of criticality could not have been left to supposition or for the writ petitioners grappling to
understand and discern an obligation to deduct tax flowing from any one of the more than the fifty
sections comprised in Chapter XVII-B. A Show Cause Notice fundamentally must apprise the
noticee of the case that it is called upon to answer, the context in which an explanation is sought and
the charge that it has to answer. The notice thus cannot leave the assessee grappling with or trying
to discern the provision which it is supposed to have infringed. In the absence of requisite
particulars, the Show Cause Notice would be liable to be quashed on the ground of being wholly
vague. As far back as in State of Orissa v. Binapani Dei30, the Supreme Court had pertinently
observed:-
―9. The first respondent held office in the Medical Department of the Orissa
Government. She, as holder of that office, had a right to continue in service according
to the Rules framed under Article 309 and she could not be removed from office
before superannuation except ―for good and sufficient reasons(cid:129). The State was
undoubtedly not precluded, merely because of the acceptance of the date of birth of
the first respondent in the service register, from holding an enquiry if there existed
sufficient grounds for holding such enquiry and for re-fixing her date of birth. But the
decision of the State could be based upon the result of an enquiry in manner
consonant with the basic concept of justice. An order by the State to the prejudice of a
person in derogation of his vested rights may be made only in accordance with the
basic rules of justice and fair play. The deciding authority, it is true, is not in the
position of a Judge called upon to decide an action between contesting parties, and
strict compliance with the forms of judicial procedure may not be insisted upon. He is
however under a duty to give the person against whom an 1967 SCC OnLine SC 15
enquiry is held an opportunity to set up his version or defence and an opportunity to
correct or to controvert any evidence in the possession of the authority which is
sought to be relied upon to his prejudice. For that purpose the person against whom
in enquiry is held must be informed of the case he is called upon to meet, and the
evidence in support thereof. The rule that a party to whose prejudice an order is
intended to be passed is entitled to a hearing applies alike to judicial tribunals and
bodies of persons invested with authority to adjudicate upon matters involving civil
consequences. It is one of the fundamental rules of our constitutional set-up that
every citizen is protected against exercise of arbitrary authority by the State or its
officers. Duty to act judicially would therefore arise from the very nature of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 90M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
function intended to be performed : it need not be shown to be super-added. If there
is power to decide and determine to the prejudice of a person, duty to act judicially is
implicit in the exercise of such power. If the essentials of justice be ignored and an
order to the prejudice of a person is made, the order is a nullity.
That is a basic concept of the rule of law and importance thereof transcends the significance of a
decision in any particular case.(cid:129)
77. The requisites of a valid Show Cause Notice were lucidly explained by the Supreme Court in
Gorkha Security Services v. Govt. (NCT of Delhi)31 as under:
―Contents of the show-cause notice
21. The central issue, however, pertains to the requirement of stating the action
which is proposed to be taken. The fundamental purpose behind the serving of
show-cause notice is to make the noticee understand the precise case set up against
him which he has to meet.
This would require the statement of imputations detailing out the alleged breaches and defaults he
has committed, so that he gets an opportunity to rebut the same. Another requirement, according to
us, is the nature of action which is proposed to be taken for such a breach. That should also be stated
so that the noticee is able to point out that proposed action is not warranted in the given case, even if
the defaults/breaches complained of are not satisfactorily explained. When it comes to blacklisting,
this requirement becomes all the more imperative, having regard to the fact that it is harshest
possible action.(cid:129) (2014) 9 SCC 105
78. Similar observations find place in UMC Technologies (P) Ltd. v. Food Corpn. of India32:
―13. At the outset, it must be noted that it is the first principle of civilised
jurisprudence that a person against whom any action is sought to be taken or whose
right or interests are being affected should be given a reasonable opportunity to
defend himself. The basic principle of natural justice is that before adjudication
starts, the authority concerned should give to the affected party a notice of the case
against him so that he can defend himself. Such notice should be adequate and the
grounds necessitating action and the penalty/action proposed should be mentioned
specifically and unambiguously. An order travelling beyond the bounds of notice is
impermissible and without jurisdiction to that extent. This Court in Nasir Ahmad v.
Custodian General, Evacuee Property- has held that it is essential for the notice to
specify the particular grounds on the basis of which an action is proposed to be taken
so as to enable the noticee to answer the case against him. If these conditions are not
satisfied, the person cannot be said to have been granted any reasonable opportunity
of being heard.(cid:129)

79. The reliance which is placed by Mr. Hossain on the decisions in Isha Beevi v. Tax Recovery
Officer33 and Commissioner of Income- Tax vs. Rajinder Nath34 is clearly misconceived. We note
that in Isha Beevi, the writ petitioner had sought the issuance of a writ of prohibition seeking
quashing of notices that were impugned. It was in the aforesaid context and the prerequisites of a
writ of prohibition that the Supreme Court observed that the mere mentioning of a wrong provision
would not justify the issuance of that prerogative writ and more so where the writ petitioner had
failed to establish a total absence of jurisdiction.
80. Insofar as Rajinder Nath is concerned, the principal question which arose in that case was
whether the Appellate Assistant Commissioner while considering an appeal could substitute Section
(2021) 2 SCC 551 (1976) 1 SCC 70 1971 SCC OnLine Del 254 153(3)(ii) in place of Section 147(a) of
the Act. It was in the aforesaid context that the Supreme Court observed as follows: -
―We are of the opinion that the contention is not well-founded. Section 147 of the
1961 Act is an enabling provision which empowers the Income-tax Officer to bring to
tax incomes which have escaped assessment either on account of the failure of the
assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for
the relevant year or the Income-tax Officer in consequence of the information in his
possession has reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped
assessment for any assessment year. That being so, it is not necessary that notice
under section 147 of 1961 Act should state under which of the clauses, whether under
clause (a) or clause (b) the same is issued. The main notice to be issued in a case
under section 147 is a notice under section 139(2), and section 148 read with section
147 merely authorises the issue of such a notice. [See Kantamani Venkatanarayan
and Son v. First Additional Income-tax Officer, (63, I.T.R. 638) (8) Deep Chand Daga
v. Income-tax Officer C- Ward, Raipur, (77, I.T.R. 661) (9) Anne Nagendram and
BommaReddiVenkayya and Company v. Commissioner of Income- tax, Andhra
Pradesh, (66 I.T.R. 46) (10) Sowdagar Ahmad Khan v. Commissioner of Income-tax,
Nellore, (66, I.T.R. 55) (11)]. The point to be considered is whether assessment can be
defeated or rendered invalid if it can be sustained under any other provision of the
Act. However, this aspect of the matter need not further detain us as in view of our
discussion above we are of the opinion that the assessment can be sustained under
section 153(3)(ii) of the 1961 Act.
It is a well settled principle of law that the exercise of a power would be referable to a jurisdiction
which confers validity upon it and merely because the Income-tax Officer while proceeding to assess
the assessee, has quoted a wrong section, the assessment cannot be rendered invalid if it can be
supported under section 153(3)(ii) of the 1961 Act."
We note that in Rajinder Nath, Section 153(3) came to be invoked while the Appellate Assistant
Commissioner was already in seisen of proceedings relating to assessment and is thus clearly
distinguishable.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 92M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
81. The principle of a power otherwise inhering or existing and not being impacted by the mere
mention of a wrong provision is one which we apply to ratify, save and uphold a decision which is
otherwise found to be valid and sustainable. We would be wary of either readily or unhesitatingly
adopting or invoking that precept at the stage of a show cause notice especially where the noticee is
left to fathom which of the more than fifty variable obligations it is alleged to have violated.
82. However, while this may have conceivably been a valid ground to interdict some of the
impugned show cause notices, we find no justification to invoke our prerogative writ powers on this
score since the petitioners have, in the course of these proceedings, been afforded more than an
ample and adequate opportunity to establish why Section 194C would not be attracted and have
been heard at great length on the questions which were raised. The applicability of Section 194C also
appears to have been expressly raised in the counter affidavits which were filed and thus placing the
petitioners on adequate notice. In any case and in view of the above, we are of the firm opinion that
the principles of prejudice would not stand attracted. It would thus be inappropriate at this late
stage of the day to interfere with the show cause notices on this ground.
83. That only leaves us to deal with the issue of the petitioners having been treated as an assessee in
default in terms of Section 201 and called upon to pay penalties by virtue of Sections 221 and 271C of
the Act. Pursuant to the interim orders that were made on these writ petitions, while the
respondents were permitted to continue further in terms of the show cause notices impugned
herein, orders if passed against the petitioner were not to be given effect to. We have not been
apprised of the status of those proceedings nor have the respondents apprised of any final orders
that may have been framed in respect of each of the writ petitioners. We have also not been apprised
of whether the EDC payments have been taxed in the hands of the HSVP or whether the same was
offered to tax.
84. We are also cognizant of the legal position of penalty be it either under Section 221 or 271C not
being an inevitable corollary in case of default. This position is made explicit by the Second Proviso
to Section 221 as well as Section 273B. The imposition of penalty where a question with respect to
taxability had remained unclear or where an assessee had good and sufficient cause to not deposit
the tax were lucidly explained by the Supreme Court in CIT v. Eli Lilly & Co. (India) (P) Ltd35. in the
following terms: -
―91. A bare reading of Section 201(1) shows that interest under Section 201(1-A) read
with Section 201(1) can only be levied when a person is declared as an
assessee-in-default. For computation of interest under Section 201(1-A), there are
three elements. One is the quantum on which interest has to be levied. Second is the
rate at which interest has to be charged. Third is the period for which interest has to
be charged. The rate of interest is provided in the 1961 Act. The quantum on which
interest has to be paid is indicated by Section 201(1-A) itself. Sub-section (1-A)
specifies ―on the amount of such tax(cid:129) which is mentioned in sub-section (1) wherein,
it is the amount of tax in respect of which the assessee has been declared in default.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 93M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
92. The object underlying Section 201(1) is to recover the tax. In the case of short
deduction, the object is to recover the shortfall. As far as the period of default is
concerned, the period starts from the date of deductibility till the date of actual
payment of tax.
Therefore, the levy of interest has to be restricted for the abovestated period only. It may be clarified
that the date of payment by the employee concerned can be treated as the date of actual payment.
94. Section 273-B states that notwithstanding anything contained in Section 271-C, no penalty shall
be imposed on the person or the assessee for failure to deduct tax at source if such person or the
assessee proves that there was a reasonable cause for the said failure. Therefore, the liability to levy
of penalty can be fastened only on the person who does not have good and sufficient reason for not
deducting tax at source. Only those persons will be liable to (2009) 15 SCC 1 penalty who do not
have good and sufficient reason for not deducting the tax. The burden, of course, is on the person to
prove such good and sufficient reason.
95. In each of the 104 cases before us, we find that non-deduction of tax at source took place on
account of controversial addition. The concept of aggregation or consolidation of the entire income
chargeable under the head ―Salaries(cid:129) being exigible to deduction of tax at source under Section 192
was a nascent issue. It has not been considered by this Court before. Further, in most of these cases,
the tax deductor assessee has not claimed deduction under Section 40(a)(iii) in computation of its
business income. This is one more reason for not imposing penalty under Section 271-C because by
not claiming deduction under Section 40(a)(iii), in some cases, higher corporate tax has been paid
to the extent of Rs 906.52 lakhs (see Civil Appeal No. 1778 of 2006 entitled CIT v. Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi Ltd.).(cid:129)
85. The aforesaid view has been reiterated in a more recent judgment of the Supreme Court in
Singapore Airlines Ltd. Vs. CIT 36where the following principles were laid down: -
―58. This Court in Hindustan Coca Cola Beverage (P) Ltd. v. CIT [Hindustan Coca
Cola Beverage (P) Ltd. v. CIT, (2007) 8 SCC 463] was confronted with a similar
situation where the recipient of income on which the assessee had failed to deduct
TDS under Section 194-C of the IT Act, had already paid income taxes on that
amount. The Court held : (SCC pp. 464-65, paras 6 & 9) ―6. The Tribunal upon
rehearing the appeal held that though the appellant assessee was rightly held to be an
―assessee in default(cid:129), there could be no recovery of the tax alleged to be in default
once again from the appellant considering that Pradeep Oil Corporation had already
paid taxes on the amount received from the appellant. It is required to note that the
department conceded before the Tribunal that the recovery could not once again be
made from the tax deductor where the payee included the income on which tax was
alleged to have been short deducted in its taxable income and paid taxes thereon.
There is no dispute whatsoever that Pradeep Oil Corporation had already paid the
taxes due on its income received from the appellant and had received refund from the
Tax Department. The Tribunal came to the right conclusion that the tax once again
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 94M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
could (2023) 1 SCC 497 not be recovered from the appellant (the deductor assessee)
since the tax has already been paid by the recipient of income.
***
9. Be that as it may, Circular No. 275/201/95- IT(B) dated 29-1-1997 issued by the Central Board of
Direct Taxes, in our considered opinion, should put an end to the controversy. The circular declares
―no demand visualised under Section 201(1) of the Income Tax Act should be enforced after the tax
deductor has satisfied the officer in charge of TDS, that taxes due have been paid by the deducted
assessee. However, this will not alter the liability to charge interest under Section 201(1-A) of the Act
till the date of payment of taxes by the deducted assessee or the liability for penalty under Section
271-C of the Income Tax Act.(cid:129)
59. A similar principle was also advanced in the context of Section 192 of the IT Act in CIT v. Eli Lilly
& Co. (India) (P) Ltd. [CIT v. Eli Lilly & Co. (India) (P) Ltd., (2009) 15 SCC 1] :
(SCC p. 30, paras 98-100)
98. ... In our view, therefore, the tax deductor assessee [the respondent(s)] were
duty-bound to deduct tax at source under Section 192(1) from the home
salary/special allowance(s) paid abroad by the foreign company, particularly when no
work stood performed for the foreign company and the total remuneration stood paid
only on account of services rendered in India during the period in question.
99. As stated above, in this matter, we have before us 104 civil appeals. We are
directing the AO to examine each case to ascertain whether the assessee employee
(the recipient) has paid the tax due on the home salary/special allowance(s) received
from the foreign company. In case taxes due on home salary/special allowance(s)
stands paid off then the AO shall not proceed under Section 201(1). In cases where
the tax has not been paid, the AO shall proceed under Section 201(1) to recover the
shortfall in the payment of tax.
100. Similarly, in each of the 104 appeals, the AO shall examine and find out whether
interest has been paid/recovered for the period between the date on which tax was
deductible till the date on which the tax was actually paid. If, in any case, interest
accrues for the aforestated period and if it is not paid then the adjudicating authority
shall take steps to recover interest for the aforestated period under Section
201(1-A).(cid:129)
60. It appears to us that if the recipient of income on which TDS has not been deducted, even
though it was liable to such deduction under the IT Act, has already included that amount in its
income and paid taxes on the same, the assessee can no longer be proceeded against for recovery of
the shortfall in TDS. However, it would be open to the Revenue to seek payment of interest under
Section 201(1-A) for the period between the date of default in deduction of TDS and the date on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 95M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
which the recipient actually paid income tax on the amount for which there had been a shortfall in
such deduction.
61. As noted earlier, the learned counsel for the parties were ad idem on the fact that the travel
agents had already paid taxes on the amounts earned by them. The Revenue had contended that the
default in payment of TDS could not be excused purely on this ground. However, the decisions in
HindustanCoca Cola [Hindustan Coca Cola Beverage (P) Ltd. v. CIT, (2007) 8 SCC 463] and Eli Lilly
& Co. [CIT v. Eli Lilly & Co. (India) (P) Ltd., (2009) 15 SCC 1] clearly bar their ability to pursue the
assessee airlines for recovery of the shortfall in TDS and restricts them to imposing interest for the
default.
xxxx xxxx xxxx
65. The ambit of ―reasonable cause(cid:129) under Section 273-B requires our scrutiny before we reach the
conclusion that the assessing officer is required to also calculate potential penalties to be levied
against the assessees. This Court in Eli Lilly & Co. [CIT v. Eli Lilly & Co. (India) (P) Ltd., (2009) 15
SCC 1] had elaborated, in the passage extracted below, on the context in which Section 273- B may
be utilised : (SCC p. 29, paras 94-96) ―94. Section 273-B states that notwithstanding anything
contained in Section 271-C, no penalty shall be imposed on the person or the assessee for failure to
deduct tax at source if such person or the assessee proves that there was a reasonable cause for the
said failure. Therefore, the liability to levy of penalty can be fastened only on the person who does
not have good and sufficient reason for not deducting tax at source. Only those persons will be liable
to penalty who do not have good and sufficient reason for not deducting the tax. The burden, of
course, is on the person to prove such good and sufficient reason.
95. In each of the 104 cases before us, we find that non- deduction of tax at source took place on
account of controversial addition. The concept of aggregation or consolidation of the entire income
chargeable under the head ―Salaries(cid:129) being exigible to deduction of tax at source under Section 192
was a nascent issue. ...
96. ... The tax deductor assessee was under a genuine and bona fide belief that it was not under any
obligation to deduct tax at source from the home salary paid by the foreign company/HO and,
consequently, we are of the view that in none of the 104 cases penalty was leviable under Section
271-C as the respondent in each case has discharged its burden of showing reasonable cause for
failure to deduct tax at source.(cid:129)
66. We find some parallels between the facts of the present case and the situation in Eli Lilly & Co.
[CIT v. Eli Lilly & Co. (India) (P) Ltd., (2009) 15 SCC 1] The liability of an airline to deduct TDS on
supplementary commission had admittedly not been adjudicated upon by this Court when the
controversy first arose in AY 2001-2002. While the learned counsel for the Revenue, Mr Kumar, has
notified us that various airlines were deducting TDS under Section 194-H at that time, this does not
necessarily mean that the position of law was settled. Rather, it appears to us that while one set of
air carriers acted under the assumption that the supplementary commission would come within the
ambit of the provisions of the IT Act, another set held the opposite view. The assessees before us
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 96M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
belong to the latter category. Furthermore, as we have highlighted earlier, there were contradictory
pronouncements by different the High Courts in the ensuing years which clearly highlights the
genuine and bona fide legal conundrum that was raised by the prospect of Section 194-H being
applied to the supplementary commission.
67. Hence, there is nothing on record to show that the assessees have not fulfilled the criteria under
Section 273-B of the IT Act. Though we are not inclined to accept their contentions, there was clearly
an arguable and ―nascent(cid:129) legal issue that required resolution by this Court and, hence, there was
―reasonable cause(cid:129) for the air carriers to have not deducted TDS at the relevant period. The logical
deduction from this reasoning is that penalty proceedings against the airlines under Section 271-C of
the IT Act stand quashed.(cid:129)
86. We find a succinct enunciation of the legal position in this regard in a judgment of this Court in
Commissioner of Income Tax (TDS) Vs. M/S American Express Bank Ltd.37 where it was observed
as follows: -
―8. From the above conclusions of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, it is apparent
that as a finding of fact, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that the assessee had
acted honestly and fairly in short deducting the tax at source under a bona fide belief
that the reimbursement of certain expenses on account of salary of
gardeners/sweepers etc., actual conveyance expenditure and the expenditure on
newspapers and periodicals were not taxable in the hands of the employees. After
having returned such a finding, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal concluded that
the assessee cannot be held to be an ‗assessee in default' under Section 201 of the Act
for short deduction of tax on the above items. Consequently, the Tribunal held that
no interest under Section 201(1A) was leviable on the assessee and, therefore, the
Tribunal deleted the levy of tax and interest under Section 201/201(1A) of the said
Act.
9. While we are not inclined to disturb the finding of the Income Tax Appellate
Tribunal that the assessee had acted in a bona fide manner, we do not agree with the
conclusion of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal that the assessee cannot be
regarded as being as an ―assessee in default(cid:129) in respect of the short deduction. It is
important to remember that the question of ―good and sufficient reasons(cid:129) only arises
when one considers the proviso to Section 201(1) of the said Act. That proviso has
been specifically introduced to negate the possibility of imposition of penalty under
Section 221 if the Assessing Officer is satisfied that the person liable had good and
sufficient reasons to not deduct and pay the tax in question. Thus, the proviso is to be
applied only to the question of penalty. It would not absolve the assessee insofar as
his being considered as an assessee in default for the purposes of Section 201(1) of
the said Act. Therefore, this finding of the Tribunal is set aside. Consequently,
question no. 1 is decided in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/82563342/ 97M/S Puri Construction Limited vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 February, 2024
10. Insofar as the second question is concerned i.e., with regard to the interest
payable under Section 201(1A) of the said Act, that is a mandatory provision, as
already held by a Division Bench of this Court in the case of CIT v. ITC Limited, ITA
No. 475/2010, dated 11.05.2011. The said Division Bench observed as under:-
xxxx xxxx xxxx
37 2011 SCC OnLine Del 5517
However, levy of interest under section 201(1A) is neither treated as penalty nor has
the said provision been included in Section 273B to make ‗reasonableness of the
cause' for the failure to deduct a relevant consideration. Section 201(1A) makes the
payment of simple interest mandatory.
The payment of interest under that provision is not penal. There is, therefore, no question of waiver
of such interest on the basis that the default was not intentional or on any other basis. (See Bennet
Coleman & Co. Ltd. v. V.P. Damle, Third ITO, [1986] 157 ITR 812 (Bom.) and CIT v. Prem Nath
Motors (P). Ltd., [2002] 120 Taxman 584 (Delhi).(cid:129) Therefore, the second question is also answered
in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee.
11. We would like to reiterate that although the questions have been decided in favour of the
Revenue, it must be remembered that the finding of the Tribunal that the assessee acted in a bona
fide manner, has to be kept in mind and, therefore, no penalty can be imposed on the assessee under
Section 221 because of the specific stipulation in the proviso to Section 201(1) of the said Act. We
also note that the exact quantum of the default needs to be computed. It would, therefore, be
necessary to remand the matter to the assessing officer for the limited purpose of computing the
exact quantum of default and the interest payable under Section 201(1A) of the said Act. We make it
clear that in case the employees of the assessee have paid the taxes as per their individual
returns/assessments, then no amount towards tax would be payable to that extent by the assessee,
however, the assessee would continue to be liable for interest under Section 201(1A) but only for the
period commencing ‗from the date on which such tax was deductible to the date on which the tax is
actually paid' [see: CIT v. Adidas India Marketing P. Ltd: (2007) 288 ITR 379 (Del) and CITv. Trans
Bharat Aviation (P) Ltd: (2010) 320 ITR 671 (Del)]. The assessing officer shall give full opportunity
to the assessee to produce documents in this regard. The appeals are allowed to the extent indicated
above.(cid:129)

87. We are accordingly of the opinion that while the challenge as raised in the writ petition must fail,
subject to due verification of the issues flagged in para 82 and 83 above as well as the scope of a
person in default and penalty provisions as noticed above, the respondents may revive the
proceedings presently pending and conclude the same in light of the observations made
hereinabove.
88. Accordingly, we negative the challenge raised in these writ petitions insofar as the invocation of
Section 194C of the Act is concerned and hold that EDC payments would be covered thereunder. For
reasons recorded in the body of this judgment, we also turn down the challenge to the Clarification
issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes dated 23 December 2017.
89. We dispose of those writ petitions where final orders under Section 201 may not have been made
by according liberty to the respondents to revive the pending show cause notice proceedings and
conclude the same in accordance with law bearing in mind the observations appearing hereinabove.
The proceedings on the pending show cause notices would be liable to be decided afresh after
affording an opportunity of hearing to the writ petitioners and decided in accordance with this
judgment.
90. We dispose of W.P. (C) 9236/2022 leaving it open to the respondents to finalise the Section 148
notice proceedings as per law and in accordance with the present judgement.
91. We allow W.P.(C) 4909/2023, W.P.(C) 4097/2021, W.P.(C) 11552/2021, W.P.(C) 4778/2021,
W.P.(C) 5319/2021, W.P.(C) 5683/2021, W.P. (C) 5715/2021, W.P.(C) 11531/2021, W.P. (C)
6631/2022, W.P. (C) 6694/2022, W.P. (C) 6737/2022, W.P. (C) 6893/2022, W.P. (C) 7978/2022,
W.P. (C) 11706/2022, W.P. (C) 4920/2023, and W.P. (C) 5313/2023 and quash the final orders
under Section 201 of the Act. The respondents shall decide the notice proceedings afresh and in
accordance with the principles laid down in the instant decision.
92. We also allow W.P.(C) 9483/2019, W.P.(C) 11232/2019, W.P.(C) 4033/2022 and W.P.(C)
299/2022 and set aside the final orders under Section 201 and consequential penalty orders
referable to Section 271C impugned therein with liberty reserved to the respondents to retry the
issue bearing in mind the judgments in Eli Lilly, Singapore Airlines and American Express.
93. We allow W.P. (C) 6552/2022 and W.P. (C ) 6558/2022 and quash the impugned notices and
orders of reassessment bearing in mind the undisputed fact that the respondents in these two writ
petitions have rested their case on Section 194 of the Act. The said issue stands conclusively
answered against the respondents in light of the judgment in BPTP. We however leave it open to the
respondents to consider these two cases under Section 201 of the Act and draw proceedings afresh if
permissible in law.
