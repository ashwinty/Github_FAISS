2008; 4763, 8006, 12745, 15121, 16857, 16909, 16945 AND

COMMON ORDER:
(per Honble Sri Justice Ramesh Ranganathan) M/s. Larsen & Toubro Ltd, Hyderabad filed W.P.
Nos.23034 and 22960 of 2007, W.P. No.8122 and 9016 of 2008, W.P. Nos.8006 and 15121 of 2009,

2013 and W.P. No.14457 of 2014. Alstom Projects India Ltd filed W.P. Nos.4763 and 12745 of 2009,
and W.P. No.26994 of 2011. M/s. Siemens Ltd, Hyderabad filed W.P. Nos.16857, 16909 and 16945
of 2009, W.P. No. 25776 of 2010, W.P. No.8664 of 2013 and W.P. No.14192 of 2014. BGR Energy
Systems Ltd, Nellore filed W.P. No.19516 of 2009.
All the petitioners have executed turnkey projects for different customers. They claimed that the
goods supplied by them, for being used in the turnkey projects, were subsequent sales exempt from
tax under Section 6(2) of the CST Act, import sales under Section 5(2) of the CST Act, and the
respondents lacked jurisdiction to subject these transactions to tax under the AP VAT Act treating
them as intra-state sales. On their claim being negatived by the assessing/revisional authorities they
have invoked the certiorari jurisdiction of this Court. It would suffice to note the contents of the
assessment order passed in W.P. No.8006 of 2009 as illustrative of the orders impugned in these
Writ Petitions.
The petitioner in W.P. No.8006 of 2009, M/s. Larsen & Toubro Ltd, is a company registered under
the Companies Act with its registered office at Mumbai. It has various branches, among others, at
Hyderabad also. It is engaged in the execution of Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC)
Works Contracts on a turnkey basis, and is a registered dealer both under the AP VAT Act and the
CST Act. For the tax period 01.04.2005 to 31.03.2006, the petitioner claimed exemption on a
turnover of Rs.373,28,65,393 as sales effected in the course of inter-state trade and commerce under
Section 6(2) of the CST Act, and sales in the course of import under Section 5(2) of the CST Act. The
exemption claimed by the petitioner related to six contracts awarded in their favour by Konaseema
EPS Oakwell Power Ltd (hereinafter referred to as Konaseema) and Vemagiri Power Generation
Limited (hereinafter referred to Vemagiri).
In the assessment order dated 12.03.2009, the assessing authority noted that the petitioner (Larson
& Toubro) had, during the financial year 2005-06, entered into six supply contracts, two of which
were with Konaseema and Vemagiri; placing reliance on certain clauses in the agreement, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 6M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
petitioner had stated that they were required to deliver the goods as agreed upon mutually, and the
contractees had also agreed to provide necessary certificates/forms for claiming tax exemption; the
goods involved were subjected to pre-despatch inspection, and testing of the equipment by the
contractee i.e. Konaseema; in the light of these terms and conditions, they had arranged the
transactions by way of a sale falling under Section 3(b) r/w. Section 6(2) of the CST Act claiming
exemption towards sale in transit in the case of Konaseema, and as a sale falling under Section 3 of
the CST Act or sale in the course of import in the case of Vemagiri; with regards transit-sales, they
had contended that, while the goods were in the course of inter-state movement, the documents of
title to the goods were transferred in favour of Konaseema which, in turn, took delivery of the goods;
with regards import sales, they claimed to have placed orders on approved dealers outside the
country; while the goods were consigned to them, the bills of lading ie, the documents of title to the
goods were endorsed in favour of Vemagiri which, in turn, had cleared the goods from customs
paying all the duties; they had filed specimen copies of the documents such as copies of the bills
issued by the ex-state seller, foreign seller, copies of LR/bill of lading, copies of the bills raised by
the petitioner, customs clearance documents etc; and they contended that these transactions were in
the nature of inter-state sale transactions, and sales in the course of import, covered by Section 3(b)
read with Section 6(2) and Section 5(2) of the CST Act and were exempt from levy of tax.
In the impugned assessment order the assessing authority observed that, in the show-cause notice,
he had opined that there were two independent transactions one between the foreign seller in favour
of the contractor, and the second set of transaction between the contractor and the contractee; the
petitioner had refuted this contention contending that the goods had moved from outside the State
specifically for the purpose of compliance of the supply contract and, therefore, the movement had
an inextricable link with the ultimate sale; the petitioner had opposed the view that there cannot be
a sale in transit in a works contract, placing reliance on Larsen & Toubro Limited v. Commissioner
of Commercial Taxes ; and they had also placed reliance on MMTC of India Ltd. v. Sales Tax Officer
in respect of High Sea Sales falling under Section 5(2) of the CST Act.
After extracting Sections 3(b) and 5(2) of the CST Act, the assessing authority held that these
provisions refer to a sale which is effected by transfer of documents of title while the goods are
under movement from one State to another (Section 3(b)), and while the goods are imported into
the territory of India (Section 5(2); the goods involved in these transactions were subject to
inspection by the contractee, which could also be rejected at the contractors cost; it is only after
satisfactory acceptance by the contractee that the material would be delivered duly endorsing the
documents of title to the goods; in State of Gujarat v. Chem-Dyes Corporation , the Gujarat High
Court had held that during the period, i.e at the time of endorsement of documents of title to the
goods, what was in-existence was an agreement to sell, and Section 3(b) did not apply; in the
present case, one of the conditions of the sale is that the goods are subject to inspection by the
contractee/purchaser; the impugned transactions were, therefore, required to be treated as
intra-state sales; the contract between the petitioner and Konaseema was to build, own and operate
a combined cycle electric power plant; the petitioner was required to design, engineer, manufacture,
test and supply the material ex-works; however, by a separate agreement, the petitioner was
required to engineer, design, procure, and construct the civil and structural works based on the data
provided by the owner and erect, install, start up, test and commission the owners equipment issued
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 7M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
to contractor, as free issue by the owner as per the written instructions, if any, of various suppliers;
thus the intention of the contractee was to build, own and operate a combined cycle electric power
plant; this work had been entrusted to the petitioner which had not only supplied the material
required for executing the above work, but had also executed such work; thus, intrinsically, it was a
works contract awarded to the petitioner duly splitting it into a supply contract and a labour
contract; the intention of both the contractor and contractee was to execute a works contract though
it was split into two; these contracts were not entrusted to two separate contractors, but to the
petitioner alone; in the case of Vemagiri the agreement, dealing with the contractors obligations,
specifically provided that the contractor had the experience, skill and resources to perform the
works; thus the intention of both the contractor and the contractee was to execute a work, where the
transfer of property takes place not as chattel qua chattel, but on the theory of accretion; in such a
case, it is impermissible to split such contracts into a supply and labour contract; the nature of the
contract was that of a works contract which the petitioner had conveniently split into two contracts
one of which was as a supply contract wherein they claimed exemption under Section 3(b) and
Section 6(2) of the CST Act; the other contract was designed as a labour contract or a works contract
as it related only to erection/installation etc., by deploying its labour, and no material was involved
therein; the petitioner had claimed exemption on a portion of this also; thus by splitting the works
contract, one into a supply contract and the other into a labour contract, the petitioner had claimed
exemption on the entire value of the contract running into crores of rupees; tax planning could only
be within the framework of law; after the 46th amendment to the Constitution of India, the States
had been conferred the power to levy tax on works contract; even thereafter the concept of transfer
of property in the goods, involved in the execution of a works contract, by theory of accretion, did
not loose its significance; even if a contract is indivisible, and is a composite one, it has to be split up
into the value of goods and labour and other services; both goods and labour put together make a
works contract; and the value of the goods had to be arrived at for the purpose of levy of tax under
the A.P VAT Act.
The assessing authority also examined the question whether there can be a sale in transit, or a sale
in the course of import, in a transaction of works contract. He held that, from the nature of the
contracts awarded, it could be seen that the petitioner was required to supply the goods as per the
supply contract; they were also required to execute the works themselves; the intention of both the
contractor and the contractee was completion of the works involving supply of goods as well as
labour; therefore the transaction related to a works contract; in such an event, the transfer of
property in goods would take place, on the theory of accretion, when the goods are incorporated into
the property of the contractee; this would happen only if the petitioner is the owner of the goods
sought to be incorporated in the works; by arranging its affairs, camouflaging such deemed sale as in
the nature of sales falling under Sections 3(b), 6(2) and 5(2) of the CST Act, the petitioner does not
cease to be the owner of the goods sought to be incorporated in the works; unless the contractor is
the owner of the goods, by the time of incorporation in a composite contract, he cannot execute such
a contract; the transactions under Sections 3(b), 6(2) and 5(2) of the CST Act do not fit within the
concept of a works contract; a works contract is a conglomerate of both goods and labour
inseparably; splitting of the value of the goods is only artificial, and is for the purpose of levy of tax;
in the present case, the petitioner themselves furnished the value of the goods separately, making it
easy for the assessing authority to arrive at the taxable turnover; the intention of the parties is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 8M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
important in deciding the nature of the transaction, but not how the documentation is made; the
intention of both the petitioner and the contractee is to execute works at Konaseema and Vemagiri
respectively; in order to avoid the brunt of taxation, the petitioner had created tailor made
documents in order to claim exemption under Sections 3(b), 6(2) and 5(2) of the CST Act; the sale of
goods, involved in a works contract, is concluded only after the said goods are
incorporated/merged/fused with the property of the contractee; the petitioner had split the contract
into supply of goods, and erection and installation, only to make it tailor made to suit Sections 3(b),
6(2) and 5(2) of the CST Act, and nothing else; the transactions must, therefore, be treated as
intra-state deemed sale of goods involved in a works contract; MMTC of India Ltd.2 was a case of
normal sale, in the course of import, where the property was transferred chattel qua chattel; in the
present case, the impugned transactions are transactions of works contract where such transfer of
property takes place on the theory of accretion, i.e. after the goods get merged/fused with the
property of the contractee; as property in the goods is transferred only after its installation and
erection, such a deemed sale is complete only after such installation and the like; the ratio of the
decision in MMTC of India Ltd.2 has no application to the facts of the present case; and the
reasoning of the Gujarat High Court, in Chem-Dyes Corporation3, is more appropriate than the
reasoning given in the judgment of the A.P. High Court in Larsen & Toubro Limited1. The assessing
authority preferred to follow the judgment in Chem- Dyes Corporation3, and expressed his inability
to accept the decision in Larsen & Toubro Limited1 on the ground that it was not logical.
Elaborate submissions were put forth by Sri S.R. Ashok, Sri N. Venkataraman, and Sri S. Ravi,
Learned Senior Counsel and Sri S. Dwarakanath, Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioners. While Sri P. Balaji Varma, and Sri S. Suribabu, Learned Special Standing Counsel for
Commercial Taxes, put forth their submissions, a substantial part of the arguments was advanced,
on behalf of the revenue, by Sri K. Vivek Reddy, Learned Special Counsel. Written arguments were
submitted, on behalf of the petitioners, by Sri A.K. Jaiswal, Sri S. Dwarakanath, Sri T. Vinod Kumar,
Sri Ch. Pushyam Kiran and Sri Priyadarshan Reddy. Written submissions were filed, on behalf of the
revenue, by Sri K. Vivek Reddy. It is convenient to examine the elaborate submissions, urged by
Learned Counsel on either side, under different heads.
I. PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS:
(I). DOES EXISTENCE OF A STATUTORY REMEDY OF APPEAL UNDER THE A.P.
VAT ACT REQUIRE THIS COURT TO REFRAIN FROM EXERCISING
JURISDICTION UNDER ARTICLE 226 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA?
It is contended, on behalf of the revenue, that the A.P. VAT Act prescribes an appellate mechanism
to challenge the revisional and assessment orders; adjudication of questions of fact, involved in
these Writ Petitions, may be appropriately undertaken through the appellate process, and not in a
Writ Petition; and the scope of the Writ Petition is limited more so when a Writ of Certiorari is
sought. Reliance is placed in this regard on State of Goa v. Laukoplast (India) Ltd. ; Titaghur Paper
Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of Orissa ; CIT v. Chhabil Dass Agarwal ; Nivedita Sharma v. Cellular

petitioners, that it is within the discretion of the High Court to grant relief under Article 226 despite
the existence of an alternative remedy; the assessing authority has not drawn any factual adverse
inference after examining various documents, and the evidence to the transaction; there is no
disputable questions of fact; the jurisdictional error, committed by the respondent authorities, is on
account of misappreciation of the law and the statutory provisions; the levy is without jurisdiction,
without authority of law and in flagrant violation of Article 286, and Sections 3, 4 & 5 of the CST
Act; the taxing authorities have assumed jurisdiction to levy tax though none existed; this Court
admitted the Writ Petitions way back in the years 2009 and 2011; and it is not open to the State, at
this length of time, to raise the dispute of an alternate remedy to non- suit the petitioners.
In Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. v. Union of India , Ashok Leyland Ltd. v. Union of India , Rapti
Commission Agency v. State of U.P., , Zunaid Enterprises v. State of M.P., , the Supreme Court and,
in Kalpana Glass Fibre Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Orissa , the Orissa High Court Division bench held that
the question whether a particular sale is an inter-State sale or an intra-State sale, and whether the
contract of sale is in respect of specific or ascertained goods, or whether it is in respect of
unascertained or future goods, are essentially questions of fact, more appropriately a mixed
question of fact and law, and the factual aspects should have been asked to be dealt with by the
authorities.
The orders, under challenge in these Writ Petitions, are either assessment or revisional orders
passed by the concerned authorities exercising jurisdiction under the AP VAT Act. This Court has
been called upon, by Learned Counsel on either side, to mainly examine whether the impugned
orders are without jurisdiction. The enquiry, in these Writ Petitions, is confined to an examination
of the material placed before the assessing and the revisional authorities on the parameters
applicable to certiorari proceedings. This Court is conscious, and need not be reminded, that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 10M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
statutory system of appeals is more effective and more convenient than an application for certiorari
as an appeal can be disposed of where the issue is a matter of law or fact, whereas an application for
certiorari is limited to cases where the issue is a matter of law appearing on the face of the order ie
where the decision is liable to be upset as it is made without jurisdiction or in consequence of an
error of law.
An application for certiorari has this advantage that it is speedier and cheaper than the other
methods. (Reg v. Hillington, London Borough Council ; Gujarat Ambuja Cement Ltd28; Hanson v.
Church Commissioner ). A writ of certiorari can be issued for correcting errors of jurisdiction such
as in cases where orders are passed without jurisdiction, or is in excess of it, or as a result of failure
to exercise jurisdiction or where, in exercise of jurisdiction conferred on it, the Court or Tribunal
acts illegally or improperly. The jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari is supervisory and not
appellate. An error of law which is apparent on the face of the record can be corrected by a writ, but
not an error of fact, however grave it may appear to be. The adequacy or sufficiency of evidence, and
the inference of fact to be drawn therefrom cannot be agitated in certiorari proceedings. (Syed
Yakoob v. K.S. Radhakrishnan ).
If the tribunal has erroneously refused to admit admissible and material evidence, or has
erroneously admitted inadmissible evidence, or if a finding of fact is based on no evidence, it would
be an error of law which can be corrected by a writ of certiorari. Where the conclusion of law by the
tribunal is based on an obvious mis-interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions, or in
ignorance of it or even in disregard of it or is expressly founded on reasons which are wrong in law,
the said conclusion can be corrected by a writ of certiorari. Whether or not an error is an error of
law, and an error of law which is apparent on the face of the record, must always depend upon the
facts and circumstances of each case, and upon the nature and scope of the legal provisions which is
alleged to have been misconstrued or contravened. (Syed Yakoob51).
It must also be borne in mind that the rule of exclusion of the writ jurisdiction, in view of the
existence of an alternative remedy, is not a rule of compulsion. (Harbans Lal Sahnia27; Gujarat
Ambuja Cement28). When, on undisputed facts, the taxing authorities are shown to have assumed
jurisdiction which they do not possess, a writ petition can be entertained. (Gujarat Ambuja
Cement28). Some exceptions to the rule of alternative remedy have been recognized i.e. where the
statutory authority has not acted in accordance with the provisions of the enactment or in defiance
of the fundamental principles of judicial procedure etc. (Chhabil Dass Agarwal6).
The existence of an alternative remedy is merely a factor to be considered, and would not impinge
upon the jurisdiction of the High Court to deal with the matter itself if it is in a position to do so on
the basis of the affidavits filed. (S.J.S. Business Enterprises (P) Ltd. v. State of Bihar ). If the High
Court has entertained a petition, despite availability of an alternative remedy, and has heard the
parties on merits it would, ordinarily, not be justified in dismissing the Writ Petition on the ground
of non-exhaustion of the statutory remedies unless it finds that factual disputes are involved, and it
would not be desirable to deal with them in a writ petition. (L. Hirday Narain v. Income Tax Officer,
Bareilly ; Gujarat Ambuja Cement Ltd28). These writ petitions were admitted several years ago, and
elaborate submissions were put forth by Learned Counsel on either side not only on the effect of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 11M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
contractual provisions, but also on the scope of Sections 3(a), 3(b), 4, 5(2), 6(2) and 9 of the CST
Act. Despite reminding us of the limited scope of judicial review, Sri K. Vivek Reddy, Learned
Special Counsel, has himself addressed us on issues which travel far beyond the findings recorded in
the impugned orders.
It is necessary, in this context, to note the contention, urged on behalf of the petitioners, that the
judgment in Larsen & Toubro Limited1 squarely applies to the facts of the present batch of cases, the
S.L.P. preferred by the revenue against the said judgment was dismissed, a similar view was taken in
State of Andhra Pradesh v. Usha Breco Ltd, Calcutta and in State of Andhra Pradesh v. Dwaraka
Prasad Radhe Ramalal ), in the light of the direct binding judgment in Larsen & Toubro Limited1,
the finding recorded by the assessing authority that the decision of the Gujarat High Court, in
Chem-Dyes Corporation3, is more logical and should be followed, is an abuse of the judicial process,
and the judgments of the jurisdictional High Court are binding on the lower authority as held by the
Supreme Court in East India Commercial Co. Ltd. v. Collector of Customs and Union of India v.
Kamalakshi Finance Corporation Ltd. .
It was also contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that the assessing and revisional authorities had
ignored the orders of the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal that similar transactions could not be subject
to tax under the AP VAT Act, even though the Supreme Court, in Union of India v. Ramlakshmi
Finance Corporation Ltd. , had held that judicial discipline require that the orders of the Tribunal
and higher appellate authorities should be followed unreservedly by the subordinate authorities;
several new contentions were urged across the bar by Sri K. Vivek Reddy, Learned Counsel for the
revenue, which were not dealt with in the impugned orders; the scope of the Writ Petition has been
sought to be enlarged which is impermissible as held in British India Steam Navigation Co. Ltd. v.
Shanmughavilas Cashew Industries ; the assessing/revisional authorities have picked some clauses
in some of the contracts, and have applied it to all the contracts which were subjected to assessment,
contrary to the law declared in Siemens Ltd. v. State of Kerala ; the burden lies upon the
Commercial Tax Officer to prove that a turnover is liable to tax (Hyderabad Deccan Cigarette
Factory v. State of A.P. ; and, as held in TELCO Ltd. v. Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes
), the assessing authority is bound to examine each individual transaction. The aforesaid objections,
put forth on behalf of the petitioners, may well justify the impugned orders being set aside, and the
matters being remanded to the concerned authorities to pass orders afresh on merits.
While the petitioners have not availed the statutory remedy of appeal, the assessing/revisional
authorities have also chosen to ignore or by-pass the judgments of the Division Bench of this Court
(which is the jurisdictional High Court) and have, instead, placed reliance on judgments of other
High Courts. As larger issues regarding the scope of certain provisions of the CST Act arise for
consideration, we have examined all the issues raised both on behalf of the petitioners and the
respondents, even though they may not have been dealt with in the impugned orders, as a quietus
must be given to the oft recurring questions regarding the jurisdiction of the authorities to subject
similar transactions to tax under the AP VAT Act. While doing so, we have been careful to limit our
scrutiny within the parameters applicable to certiorari proceedings. We see no reason, therefore, to
now relegate the petitioners to the statutory remedy of appeals under the provisions of the AP VAT
Act.

II. ARE THE SUBJECT CONTRACTS DIVISIBLE OR INDIVISIBLE CONTRACTS?
It is submitted, on behalf of the petitioners, that the assessing authority has integrated two divisible
separate contracts as a composite indivisible contract drawing an adverse legal inference that the
contracting parties are one and the same; courts have recognized dual capacities between the same
contracting parties; it is open to the petitioner to sell goods in transit or as high sea sales, and to
secure the same back as free supplies or as an agent or as a bailee, and execute the installation and
commissioning work; it is for the contracting parties to design their contracts - either as divisible or
indivisible; courts/tribunals cannot substitute or rewrite contracts; it is only if, in reality, the
contracting parties execute an indivisible works contract, and the property actually passes at the
time of accretion or incorporation, can splitting up of the contracts, into sale and service contracts,
be construed a camouflage; a contract cannot be re-characterized based on the strength of a possible
tax treatment; the subject contracts are divisible in nature; though not all contracts contain a
cross-fall breach clause, such a clause has been ascribed to all the contracts in a sweeping manner; a
cross-fall breach clause only ensures redressal measures being taken by way of a claim for damages,
and neither encumbers nor restores title; this clause is of discharge of service obligations, and does
not postpone passage of title to the goods; normally the bidding documents, for participating in the
contract, require one entity to apply for both the supply and erection parts; award of the contract
depends upon the lowest price for both supply and erection contracts; from the point of view of the
buyer it is considered as one indivisible works contract; these conditions are prescribed in
government contracts as per government policy, and are not relevant for taxation of goods; some of
the contracts are negotiated contracts, no bidding took place and no bidding documents exist; and
the effort of the assessing authority, to call the contracts indivisible works contracts, though they are
not, is of no consequence since an indivisible contract is also divisible by legal fiction.
Sri K. Vivek Reddy, Learned Counsel for the respondent, would submit that the assessing/revisional
authorities have held that, even though the petitioners had entered into supply and erection
contracts, it constituted a composite contract i.e. an indivisible works contract; in arriving at this
finding, they had reviewed the contracts, evidence, documents and the nature of the work done by
the petitioners, in particular, on (a) the presence of a cross fall breach clause in the contracts in
various manifestations;
(b) the contractual clauses, and the description of the documents, itself show that the petitioner was
executing one work; (c) the intention between the parties is only to execute the work with the
material supplied by the contractor; (d) the rights of the dealer (supplier) over the property in the
goods and the risk due to injury and loss to the goods, remains with the supplier till the
commissioning of the turnkey project; (e) the assessee remains the owner of the goods till
termination of its movement; and (f) the property in the goods is transferred to the employer only at
the time of accretion; if the clauses in both the contracts are inter- linked, and are closely related to
each other, the fact that they are embodied in two instruments does not alter the nature of the
contract; the subject contracts are indivisible works contracts wherein title passes only upon
incorporation; all the subject supply contracts not only provide a schedule for supply but also
stipulate a schedule for erection; prohibition of assignment also shows that it is an indivisible works
contract; the supply contracts (as opposed to the erection contracts) contemplate a certification
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 13M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
clause for the entire work, and not just the supply component; the stipulation, as to the use of goods
in the supply contract, shows that the goods are to be used for erection; in the supply contract, the
seller is entitled for payment only when the goods, that were supplied, are successfully put to use ie
upon successful erection; the presence of a cross fall breach clause in the supply contracts show that
the supply and erection contract is an indivisible works contract; all the subject contracts have a
cross fall breach clause in various manifestations; the bidding document is the source document,
and forms the basis for the supply and erection contracts; the bidding document, for the
Siemens-RINL contract, reveals that the employer contemplated only one work i.e., a turnkey
project for which the supply and erection contracts have been executed; it is a condition of the
bidding document that the parties, to the supply and erection contract, must be the same; the
bidders had to quote one price for the entire project including supply and erection; and the
petitioners are not in the business of supplying articles, but in executing turnkey projects.
For convenience sake the petitioners shall, hereinafter, be referred to as the contractor; the person,
from whom the contractor purchased the goods, as the supplier; and the person, for whom the
goods were purchased and incorporated in the works, as the owner. The submission, made on behalf
of the petitioners, is that the subject contracts are two independent contracts - one for supply and
the other for erection, and the bailment/free issues clauses in the contracts show that, after the
goods are sold by the petitioner - contractor to the owner, the owner then issues the very same
material as free issues to the petitioner-contractor for being used in the erection and installation of
the plant. The contention of the respondents, however, is that the contract is, in effect, an indivisible
contract and, while they are styled as two contracts i.e., supply and erection contracts, they are, in
fact, one composite indivisible contract.
Prior to the 46th amendment to the Constitution, an indivisible contract would have disabled the
revenue from subjecting the goods, which formed part of the turnkey project, to tax as a turnkey
project is immovable property, and does not constitute goods (movable/chattel). It is because of the
legal fiction, created by Article 366-29(A)(b), that an indivisible contract can be fictionally divided
into two contracts, one for sale of the goods used in the erection and installation of the project, and
the other for work and services; and to tax the deemed sale of goods involved in the execution of
such a contract.
In effect, the submission of the revenue is that these two contracts (supply contract and erection
contract) should be treated as a single indivisible contract; and thereafter, by legal fiction under
Article 366-29(A)(b), it should again be divided into two contracts one for sale of goods, and the
other for labour and services. Why should the suppy and erection contracts be integrated, only for it
to be again divided by legal fiction? Would it make any difference if the subject contracts were
treated as two separate contracts at the inception, instead of treating them as one, and then
fictionally dividing them into two? While the purpose sought to be achieved thereby is not spelt out,
we understand the submission of Sri K. Vivek Reddy, Learned Counsel for the respondent, to be
that, if it is a single indivisible contract, the property in the goods would pass to the owner on its
incorporation in the works, the sale of such goods would not take place during the course of its
movement from one State to another, and the petitioners would thereby be disentitled from
claiming exemption under Section 6(2) of the CST Act. Secondly, as the transfer of property in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 14M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
goods would take place on its incorporation in the works, and as the work is executed within the
State, transfer of title to the goods would take place within the State; and such a sale would an
intra-state sale liable to tax under the A.P. VAT Act. If these submissions of Sri K. Vivek Reddy,
Learned Counsel for the revenue were to merit acceptance, then the measure of tax, even if it be an
inter-state sale, would be the value of the goods at the stage of its incorporation in the works, which
would include not only the value of the goods at the time of its delivery within the State, but also the
expenditure incurred in relation thereto till its incorporation in the works which, as held in Gannon
Dunkerly & Co. v. State of Rajastan would also include the profit element.
It is necessary, therefore, to examine whether the subject contracts are two separate independent
contracts or they are, in reality, one composite indivisible contract disguised as two independent
contracts-one for suppy of goods and other for services rendered for installation and erection of the
turnkey project. Where parties enter into distinct and separate contracts, one for the transfer of
material for monetary consideration, and the other for payment of remuneration for services and for
work done, there are, ordinarily, two agreements, though there is a single instrument embodying
them. (State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley & Co. (Madras) Ltd., ). In such cases the transaction
would not be one and indivisible, but would fall into two separate agreements. (Hindustan
Aeronautics Ltd. v. State of Karnataka ; State of Himachal Pradesh v. Associated Hotels of India
Ltd., ) (five judges). If there are two independent contracts, namely, purchase of the components
from a dealer, it would be a contract for sale and similarly, if a separate contract is entered into for
installation, that would be a contract for labour and service. (Kone Elevator India (P) Ltd. v. State of
T.N. ).
A composite contract, for supply and installation, should be treated as a works contract as it is not
chattel sold as chattel or, for that matter, a chattel being attached to another chattel. (Kone Elevator
India (P) Ltd.67). A 'works contract' is an "entire and indivisible" works contract for the
construction/execution of a turnkey project to specifications where the person executing the work is
entitled to receive the total price (Thomson Press (I) Ltd. v. State of Haryana ). While examining the
exercise of divisibility, the dominant intention behind such a contract, namely, whether it was for
sale of goods or for services, is rendered otiose or immaterial. (State of Karnataka v. Pro Lab ;
Larsen and Toubro Ltd. v. State of Karnataka ). The dominant nature test or overwhelming
component test or the degree of labour and service test are no longer applicable. (Kone Elevator
India (P) Ltd.67; Larsen and Toubro Ltd.70). It is open to the taxing authorities to tax that part of
the contract which relates to the sale of goods. (Banarsi Das Bhanot v. State of M.P., ; Gannon
Dunkerly (I)64). The contracts, which are the subject matter of all these Writ Petitions, are all works
contracts as they involve both supply of material, and rendering services in connection with the
work of erection and installation of the plant.
In L.S. Chandramouli and Company v. The State of Madras , the Division Bench of the Madras High
Court held that there was nothing wrong in the same person holding two different capacities, one as
an agent of a non-resident principal and the other as proprietor of his own business.This judgment
was referred to with approval by the Supreme Court in Karnataka Pawnbrokers Assn. v. State of
Karnataka . In State of Karnataka v. Bangalore Soft Drinks P. Ltd. , the Supreme Court held that the
terms of the contract indicated that the respondent had a dual role to play - one as seller of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 15M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
goods and the other as that of a transporter or the carrier of the goods. The same person can, no
doubt, play a dual role and, merely because both the contracts are entrusted to the same person, two
separate and independent contracts would not become a single indivisible contract. Turn-key
projects, however, stand on a different footing.
In turn-key projects, more particularly of the kind involved in this batch of Writ Petitions, the same
person has been entrusted with the responsibility of procuring material, and of erection and
installation of equipment. While in-built safeguards are provided in all the contracts to ensure
quality of the material, and effective performance of the erection contract, the supply contracts, in
substance, do not absolve the petitioners-contractors of their obligations of erection and installation
of equipment after the goods are sold by them to the owner. The petitioners-contractors obligations,
under both the supply and erection contracts, cease only after the turn-key project becomes
operational, and after final payment is made both for supply of material and for erection and
installation of equipment. While a dual role is not impermissible in execution of turnkey projects, its
relevance, in determining whether or not the subject contracts are indivisible works contracts, is
insignificant. While we see no reason to burden this judgment with a reference to all the relevant
clauses in each of the agreements, it is useful to note some of them.
Payment under clause 4.2.2 of the Alstom GVK and Alstom Goutami supply contract is conditional
on performance acceptance under the services contract. Clause 14.4 of the Alstom
- GVK and the Alstom Gautami Supply Contract stipulates that, if the services contract is terminated
by the owner, the owner shall have the right to terminate the supply contract. Likewise Clause 15.4
of the erection contract between Alstom GVK and Alstom Goutami enables the employer to
terminate the erection contract if the supply contract has been terminated. Para 1.1 (v) of Appendix
B thereof provides for 5% of the price of supplies to be made on the occurrence of the provisional
performance acceptance of the facility in accordance with Clause 4.2.2 of the agreement.
Clause 14.2.1(c) of the L & T - Konaseema Supply Contract enables the supply contract to be
terminated by the owner in the event of termination of the owners other contracts (erection
contract). Clause 1.3 of Appendix I provides for payment for supplies, and for discharge of the
obligations to supply, after test of the material at the facility site. Clause 1.4 of Appendix-B provides
for part payment for the supply to be made on issuance a site test certificate i.e., after completion of
erection.
Appendix-H of the L & T Vemagiri supply agreement stipulates that 5% of the price shall be paid on
successful test for the identified packages as per the pricing and technical specifications; 5% of the
price on provisional acceptance; and 5% of the price on final acceptance. Provisional acceptance is
defined under the supply agreement to mean the achievement of provisional acceptance as defined
in the civil works and erection agreement, and in accordance with the terms thereof. It is evident,
therefore, that 10% of the payment under the supply agreement is required to be made only after
provisional and final acceptance as stipulated under the erection agreement.

The aforesaid clauses show that termination of the supply contract would enable the employer to
terminate the erection contract and vice-versa. In Indure Ltd. v. CTO , the bidder was required to
quote a lump sum price in its proposal for the entire scope of the work covered under the bid
documents. The total contract was agreed to be divided into two separate contracts, (i) supply
contract, and (ii) erection contract, with a cross-fall breach clause wherein breach of either of the
contracts entitled the employer/owner/contractee (NTPC) to cancel the other contract also. NTPC
awarded two contracts to Indure Ltd. for performing the work of erection of the plant on a turnkey
basis. The Supreme Court, in Indure Ltd75, held that, even though two contracts were entered into
between the parties, it was only one contract for the reason that NTPC kept a right with it with
regard to the cross-fall breach clause, meaning thereby that default in one contract would
tantamount to default in another, and the whole contract was liable to be cancelled.
Existence of a cross-fall breach clause, or a clause which enables the owner to terminate the supply
contract for breach of the erection contract and vice-versa, would mean that, while the contracts are
ostensibly two separate contracts one for supply of material and the other for rendering works and
services, they are, in fact, one single indivisible contract. The goods supplied to the owner, under the
supply contracts, are tailor made goods, and cannot be bought off the shelf. Such goods cannot,
ordinarily, be sold to another except for its use in turnkey projects of a similar nature. The
petitioners have been entrusted with the work mainly for their expertise in erection and installation
of plants in the execution of turn-key projects. As they were entrusted with the work of erection and
installation, the petitioners-contractors have also been entrusted with the task of procuring material
therefor. The functions relating to the supply of material, and rendering services of erection and
installation, are integrally connected and are inter-dependent.
In some of these cases, the contractors were required to submit a single bid both for supply of
material, and for erection and installation of equipment for the turn-key project. Clause 3.2 of the
letter of award of the work issued by Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd (Power Grid for short) to
Siemens Limited stipulates that the contract shall be construed as a single source responsibility
contract, and any breach in any part of the contract shall be treated as a breach of the entire
contract. Clause 2.3 of the Seimens Power Grid agreement stipulates that the work, under the letter
of Award, shall be performed by the Contractor strictly in line with the bidding documents. Clause
2.3(ii) of the Siemens - Power Grid Supply Contract stipulates that breach, under the erection
contract, would automatically be deemed as a breach of the supply contract and any such breach or
occurrence would give Power Grid the right to terminate the erection contract and the supply
contract. An identical clause is found in clause 2.3(ii) of the Siemens - Power Grid erection contract
also. Clause 3.3 of the Siemens Power Grid supply contract stipulates that the total ex-works prices
for the items are on a lumpsum/lot/set basis. Clause 6.1(iii)(c) of the supply contract stipulates that
10% of the ex-works price component shall be paid on successful completion of erection, testing and
commissioning of the sub-station and issuance of taking over certificate. The Siemens - Power Grid
supply contract also prescribes an implementation schedule not only for supply but also for erection,
testing and commissioning of the power plant.
The tender notice issued by the Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL) shows that both supply and
erection fall within the scope of the very same work. Clause 5.1 of the bidding document of RINL
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 17M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
stipulates that the work comprises of design and engineering, manufacture and supply of plant and
equipment, erection work, testing, start-up and commissioning etc. Clause 4.1 prohibits the
contractor from transferring or assigning the contract or any part thereof without the written
consent of the employer. The correspondence between Siemens and RINL shows that the subject
composite work was awarded to Siemens Limited for a lumpsum amount. Clause 23.2 of the bidding
document stipulates that the prices to be quoted are intended to provide for all works duly and
properly completed in accordance with the General Conditions of Contract and Special Conditions of
Contract, if any, and are required to include the cost of delivery of the equipment. Clause 23.2.2
stipulates that payment against supplies would be released only on receipt and acceptance of
material as per payment terms referred to in the General Conditions. Article 8 of the Seimens RINL
agreement stipulates that, in consideration of the payment to be made by the customer (owner) to
the contractor, the contractor covenants with the customer to design, manufacture & supply the
plant and equipment as per the contract specification and other documents of the contract. A
consolidated price is stipulated as the total contract price combining the contract prices of the
individual agreements. It is evident that, while the form of the contracts indicate that they are two
separate contracts, in substance they are one single indivisible works contract for supply of material
and for erection and installation of equipment. Existence of a bailment clause or a free issues clause
does not alter the situation.
Reliance placed by the petitioners on Larsen & Toubro Ltd.1 is misplaced. Mere general
observations, or casual expressions of the Court, are of no avail. (Girnar Traders v. State of
Maharashtra ). A decision, which is neither founded on reasons nor it proceeds on a consideration of
an issue, cannot be deemed to have binding effect. (Jaisri Sahu v. Rajdewan Dubey ; Municipal
Corporation of Delhi v. Gurnam Kaur ; B. Shama Rao v. Union Territory of Pondicherry ; State of
U.P. v. Synthetics and Chemicals ). A judgment delivered without argument, without reference to
the relevant provisions of the Act, and without any citation of authority need not be followed.
(Gurnam Kaur78). A mere direction of the Court without considering the legal position is not
binding. (Vishnu Dutt Sharma v. Manju Sharma ). The view, if any, expressed without analysing the
statutory provision cannot be treated as a precedent. (N. Bhargavan Pillai v. State of Kerala ).
Passing observations in a judgment without any argument and without reason do not form part of
the ratio, and cannot be treated as having the weight of authority. (Gurnam Kaur78; Bengal Club
Ltd. v. Susanta Kumar Chowdhury ). The conclusion of the Division bench, in Larson & Toubro Ltd1,
that the contracts before it was a divisible contract is not preceded by any reasons, and is not a
declaration of law. The opinion expressed in the said judgment is without an analysis of the relevant
contractual provisions or judicial precedents, and is not a precedent binding on a co-ordinate bench.
Placing reliance on Sangramsinh P. Gaekwad v.
Shantadevi P. Gaekwad and Akshaya Restaurant v. P. Anjanappa Sri N. Venkataraman, Learned
Senior Counsel, would submit that, in para 29 of their writ affidavit, the petitioner (L&T) had
inadvertently stated that the contracts are composite indivisible contracts whereas in the very same
affidavit, in every other place, there is a consistent plea that the contracts are divisible contracts of
sale and erection; the petitioner has filed an affidavit on 24.12.2014 bringing to the notice of this
Court this inadvertent error; and this affidavit may be taken on record, the error condoned, and the

plea deleted.
On the other hand, relying on Nagindas Ramdas v.
Dalpatram Ichharam ; Bishwanath Prasad v. Dwarka Prasad ; Viswalakshmi Sasidharan v. Branch
Manager, Syndicate Bank ; Gautam Sarup v. Leela Jetly ; Heeralal v. Kalyan Mal ; Modi Spinning &
Weaving Mills Company Ltd. v. Ladha Ram & Co. ; Steel Authority of India v. Union of India ; Union
of India v. Pramod Gupta (Dead) by Lrs. ); Nichhalbhai Vallabhai v. Jawantlal Zinabha ; L. J. Leach
and Co. Ltd. v. Jardine Skinner and Co ; and Vimal Chand Ghevarchand Jain v. Ramakant Eknath
Jadoo , Sri K. Vivek Reddy, Learned Special Counsel, would submit that the petitioners cannot resile
from their categorical admissions that the subject contract is an indivisible works contract; L & T
has admitted in its Writ Petition that the contract between the petitioner and owner is an indivisible
works contract; the averments in the Writ Affidavit cannot be treated as an inadvertent or a
typographical error; the statement made by the petitioner is an admission; and admission in
pleadings stand on a higher pedestal than evidentiary admissions. As we have held that the subject
contracts are indivisible contracts, it is unnecessary for us to examine the effect of the admission, by
L & T in their pleadings, that the contract is an indivisible contract.
III. DOES THE SALE OF GOODS BY THE PETITIONER-
CONTRACTORS TO THE OWNERS FALL WITHIN THE AMBIT OF SECTION 6(2) OF THE CST
ACT?
(i). SECTION 6(2) OF THE CST ACT: ITS SCOPE:
It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that the assessment order does not
dispute that the contracts envisage supply of goods from outside the State of Andhra
Pradesh either as inter-state sale or transit sale or import sale or that a transit sale
had taken place during the movement of goods; the contractual conditions relating to
site test, performance guarantee or cross fall breach do not encumber or delay or
defer the transfer of title to the goods till the stage of incorporation or accretion; it is
the transferred goods, or the goods sold, which are given back to the supplier as free
issues which are used in erection and installation to meet the performance and the
liquidated damages test; failure does not defer or postpone transfer of title, and only
obligates re- performance or recovery of damages from the contractor; in the present
case, the goods were sold in transit by way of endorsement, and after securing
necessary statutory forms, raising sales invoices and concluding the sale before
termination of movement; the inter-state transactions are transit sales eligible for
exemption under Section 6(2) of the CST Act; the sale transactions are sales effected
in transit during movement of the goods; appropriation of the goods to the contract
took place, even before movement of the goods, at the place of manufacturer itself;
and the goods, both in fact and in law, belong to the contractee only.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 19M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
The contracts, which are the subject matter of these Writ Petitions, broadly envisage
purchase of goods/material by the contractor from the identified suppliers referred to
in the contract; the material so purchased to be inspected by the owner prior to its
transportation from the State where the goods are manufactured; and, thereafter, for
the goods to be transported by the contractor to the work site of the owner in the
other State where it is to be used in the erection and installation of the turnkey
project. These goods are tailor made for being utilised exclusively for the turnkey
project.
These contracts are, basically, in two parts the first relating to supply of material and
the second to erection and installation of equipment. The supply contract refers to
the suppliers of material from whom the contractor is required to purchase the
goods. After the goods are purchased from these pre-identified suppliers, most of
whom are dealers outside the State, the goods are then transported by the contractor
from outside the State to the State of Andhra Pradesh (now the States of Telangana
and Andhra Pradesh). The supply contract stipulates that the contractor should
purchase the goods from the identified suppliers outside the state on which tax is
paid by the contractor under Section 3(a) of the CST Act; after purchasing the goods
from the supplier, the contractor is contractually bound to sell the goods to the
owner, during transit, by endorsement of the lorry receipts. While the goods are
purchased by the contractor from the supplier at a lower price, the very same goods
are sold by the contractor to the owner at a higher price. No tax is paid on the sale of
goods by the petitioner-contractor to the owner. The petitioners state that the goods
purchased by them, from suppliers outside the State, was subjected to tax under
Section 3(a) of the CST Act, and claim that the goods sold by them to the owner is a
transit sale exempt from tax under Section 6(2) of the CST Act. By this arrangement
under the supply contracts, which requires the contractor to purchase the prescribed
goods from identified suppliers outside the State, and to sell the very same goods at a
higher price to the owner by endorsement on the LRs when the goods are in transit,
the tax paid is lower than what would have been paid if the price, at which the
contractor sold the goods to the owner, is taken as the value of the goods sold in the
course of inter-state trade and commerce. While it is not in dispute that, by this
contractual arrangement between the contractor and the owner, there is a loss of
revenue to the public exchequer, the contention, urged on behalf of the petitioners, is
that the parties to the agreement are entitled to arrange their affairs in a manner
which would result in a lower tax burden on them.
It is no doubt true that every man is entitled, if he can, to order his affairs so that the
tax attaching under the appropriate Acts is less than it otherwise would be. If he
succeeds in ordering them so as to secure this result, then, however, unappreciative
the tax gatherers may be of his ingenuity, he cannot be compelled to pay an increased
tax. (IRC v. Duke of Westminster ; Union of India v. Azadi Bachao Andolan ). Tax
planning is not illegitimate. Every transaction or arrangement which is permissible
under the law, and which has the effect of reducing the tax burden of the assessee,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 20M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
need not be looked upon with disfavour (Azadi Bachao Andolan98; M.V. Valliappan
v. ITO ) or viewed with suspicion, or be treated as a device for avoidance of tax
irrespective of the legitimacy or the genuineness of the act. (Banyan and Berry v. CIT
; Azadi Bachao Andolan98).
While tax planning may be legitimate, provided it is within the framework of the law,
colourable devices cannot be a part of tax planning, and it is wrong to encourage or
entertain the belief that it is honourable to avoid the payment of tax by resorting to
dubious methods. It is the obligation of every citizen to pay taxes honestly without
resorting to subterfuge. (Mc Dowell v. CTO ; Banyan and Berry100; Azadi Bachao
Andolan98; CIT v. A. Raman and Co. ).
While parties cannot be compelled to enter into agreements in a manner which would
generate higher tax revenue, levy of tax, on transactions embodied in a document,
would depend upon the meaning and content of the language used in accordance
with the ordinary rules of construction. (C.I.T. v. Motors & General Stores (P) Ltd ).
The name given to a transaction by the contracting parties does not, necessarily,
decide the nature of the transaction.
The question always is what is the real character of the transaction, not what the parties call it.
(Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Wesleyan and General Assurance Society ; Motors & General
Stores (P) Ltd103). The Court must examine the substance of the contract, and not be swayed by its
form. In drawing a distinction between the form and substance of the arrangement, the Court
cannot brush aside deeds, disregard the legal rights and liabilities arising under a contract between
parties, and decide the question of taxability or non-taxability upon the footing that the rights and
liabilities of the parties are different from what in law they are. (Motors & General Stores (P)
Ltd103; Duke of Westminster case ). The taxing authority is not restricted merely to the letter of the
document. He must enquire into the true nature of the transaction after examining the relevant
materials, and should ascertain whether it partakes the nature of the transaction which the statute
renders taxable. He is, in ascertaining the true nature of the contract, also entitled to consider how
the contract was performed. (Carl Still G.M.B.H.9). Bearing these aspects in mind let us now
examine the scope of Sections 3(a), 3(b) and 6(2) of the CST Act to ascertain whether the subject
contracts fall within its ambit.
Principles are formulated, under Chapter II of the CST Act, for determining when a sale or purchase
of goods takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce or outside a State or in the
course of import or export. Section 3, in Chapter II, explains when a sale or purchase of goods is said
to take place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. It creates a legal fiction, and requires a
sale or purchase of goods to be deemed to take place in the course of inter-state trade or commerce
only if it falls within clauses (a) &(b) thereof. Within Section 3(b) are sales in which property in the
goods passes during movement of the goods from one State to another by transfer of documents of
title thereto, whereas Section 3(a) covers sales, other than those included in clause (b), in which the
movement of goods from one State to another is under the contract of sale, and property in the
goods passes in either States. A sale which takes place under Section 3(a) stands excluded from the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 21M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
purview of Section 3(b) and vice versa. In respect of an inter-State sale, tax is leviable only once, and
that indicates that the two clauses of Section 3 are mutually exclusive. The dividing line between
sales under Section 3(a) and those falling under Section 3(b) is that, in the former, the movement is
under the contract whereas, in the latter, the contract comes into existence only after
commencement and before termination of the inter-State movement of the goods. An inter-State
sale is governed under Section 3(b), if it is effected by transfer of documents of title after such
movement has started, and before the goods are actually delivered. (TISCO v. S.R. Sarkar ; A&G
Projects and Technologies Ltd v. State of Karnataka ).
For a sale to fall under Section 3(b), the sale must be effected by the transfer of documents of title to
the goods. The transfer of documents, contemplated by Section 3(b), is a transfer which, in law,
amounts to delivery of the goods. Transfer of documents either by endorsement or delivery
completes the transfer of title but, in the absence of an indication to that effect in the statute, the
place where the documents are transferred is not necessarily the place of the sale. (S.R. Sarkar106).
Transfer of documents of title may be effected by handing them over. An endorsement to that effect
on the documents is one mode of proving the fact. (The Dy. Commissioner of Commercial Tax,
Madurai Division, Madurai v. A.R.S. Thirumeninatha Nadar Firm, Tuticorin ). A railway/lorry
receipt is a document of title to the goods and, for all purposes, represents the goods. When the
railway/lorry receipt is handed over to the consignee on payment, the property in the goods is
transferred. (Commissioner of Income-Tax, Madhya Pradesh and Bhopal, Nagpur v. Bhopal Textiles
Ltd., Bhopal ; Bharat & Co. v. Trade Tax Officer ).
Where the property in the goods has passed, either before the movement has commenced or after
the movement from one State to another has ceased, the sale will not fall within clause (b). A sale
effected by transfer of documents of title after commencement of movement and before its
conclusion, as defined by the two terminii set out in Explanation (1) of Section 3, and no other sale,
will be regarded as an inter-State sale under Section 3(b). (S.R. Sarkar106). The reference to two
States in Section 3(b) makes it clear that termination of the journey of the goods takes place when
the goods land in the importing State. If the documents of title are transferred after the goods have
landed, all sales thereafter are intra-State sales. (Arjun Dass Gupta & Bros v. Commissioner of Sales
Tax, Delhi Administration, Vikash Bhawan, New Delhi ).
The ingredients of Section 6(2) of the CST Act are (1) there must be a sale of goods in the course of
inter-state trade or commerce; (2) the sale (a) has either occasioned movement of such goods from
one state to another (ie a Section 3(a) sale) or (b) has been effected by a transfer of documents of
title to such goods during their movement from one state to another (ie a Section 3(b) sale); (3)
there is a subsequent sale during such movement (ie when the goods are in movement, pursuant to a
Section 3(a) or a Section 3(b) sale, the very same goods are again sold); (4) the subsequent sale is
effected by a transfer of documents of title to such goods (ie the very same goods which have
commenced movement from one State, pursuant to a Section 3(a) or a Section 3(b) sale, but have
not yet completed its movement in the other State, are again sold during their movement (transit)
by effecting transfer of documents of its title); (5) the sale of goods is to a registered dealer; (6) the
goods are of the description referred to in Section 8(3) of the CST Act; (7) if these ingredients are
satisfied then the subsequent sale is exempt from tax under the CST Act; (8) such a subsequent sale
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 22M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
(ie the subsequent sale referred to in Section 6(2)) shall not be exempt from tax under Section 6(2)
unless the dealer, effecting the subsequent sale, furnishes to the prescribed authority (a) the E-I or
E-II certificate from the registered dealer from whom the goods were purchased by him (in terms of
Rule 12(4) of the CST (Registration and Turnover) Rules, 1957; and (b) a C or D form/certificate (in
terms of Rule 12(1) of the 1957 Rules) from the registered dealer to whom the subsequent sale was
made by him (ie the purchaser of the goods under the first sale becomes the vendor (seller) of the
goods in the second (subsequent) sale); and (9) the certificates, referred to at point 8(a) and 8(b)
above, are furnished in the prescribed manner within the prescribed time.
Section 6(1) envisages payment of tax on all sales effected in the course of inter-state trade or
commerce and, in effect, provides for a multi-point or multi-stage taxation regime for the inter-state
sale of goods. Section 6(1) is subject to the other provisions of the CST Act. Section 6(2), which
contains a non-obstante clause, has been introduced to avoid the cascading effect of multiple
taxation. (A&G Projects & Technologies Ltd.107). In view of the non- obstante clause, the provisions
of Section 6(2) prevail over Section 6(1) of the CST Act and all subsequent sale of goods (i.e., the
second sale onwards), during their movement from one state to another, are exempt from tax. It is
only with a view to ensure free and unhindered movement of goods from one state to another that
the first inter-state sale, be it under Section 3(a) or under Section 3(b), is alone subject to tax and all
subsequent sales, effected during the movement of such goods from one State to another, are
exempt from tax under Section 6(2) of the CST Act.
(ii) SHOULD THE SUBSEQUENT SALE, TO BE EXEMPT UNDER SECTION 6(2), HAVE THE
CHARACTERISTICS OF AN INTER- STATE SALE UNDER SECTION 3(b) OF THE CST ACT?
It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that a transit sale, exempt under Section 6(2), is not a
Section 3(b) sale for the following reasons: (a) a transit sale is necessarily a second or a subsequent
sale, whereas a Section 3(b) sale is a first sale; (b) more importantly, since a transit sale is only a
second sale or a subsequent sale, it would necessarily be preceded by a first sale; therefore, a Section
6(2) sale cannot be construed as a Section 3(b) sale; the purpose of reference to Section 3(b) along
with Section 6(2) is limited; both a Section 3(b) sale and a Section 6(2) sale take place during
movement of goods in transit, and by way of transfer of documents of title during their movement;
because of this similarity, Explanation I to Section 3 is also read into Section 6(2); the taxing power,
and the jurisdictional competence to tax, in the case of sales falling under Section 3(a) and Section
3(b), and the second or the subsequent sale which are not exempt under Section 6(2), are not given
to the same States; the stark dissimilarities are a Section 3(b) sale is a first sale whereas a Section
6(2) sale is a second or a subsequent sale; and the power to tax the transactions by the respective
States are also not the same.
It is contended, on behalf of the revenue, that a sale ceases to be a sale exempt under Section 6(2) if
the following occur: (a) if the title passes on delivery, the sale cannot be a transit-sale because title is
passing after movement; (b) if title passes ex-works, the sale cannot be a transit sale since title
passes prior to movement (refer:
definition of ExWorks in Blacks Law Dictionary, 8th Edn. at Page
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 23M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
626); (c) if title passes upon delivery to the carrier, it cannot be a transit sale since
title passes prior to movement; (d) if title passes only upon full payment, it is not a
transit sale as title does not pass during movement; (e) if there is a pre-determined
sale, or a pre-determined buyer, prior to movement it cannot be a transit sale; (f) if
payment is upon successful erection, it is not a transit sale since title passes only after
movement is complete; (g) if the property passes after a certificate is issued by the
owner, it cannot be a transit sale because title passes after movement; and (h) a sale
after inspection cannot be a transit sale as title passes only after delivery; the second
inter-state sale has, necessarily, to be a Section 3(b) sale because the language used in
Section 6(2), to describe the second inter-state sale, is the same as in Section 3(b);
it is not, and cannot be treated, as a third category of inter-state sale; and the CST Act contemplates
only two categories of inter- state sales ie either a Section 3(a) or a Section 3(b) sale.
In order to attract Section 6(2), it is essential that the sale must be a subsequent inter-State sale and
should be preceded by a prior inter-State sale. (A&G Projects & Technologies Ltd.107). The use of
the word subsequent means that the sale, on which exemption is claimed under Section 6(2) of the
CST Act, must be preceded by an earlier inter-state sale. The words such goods, used in the second
limb of Section 6(2), refer to the goods in the first limb which are the goods sold during the course of
inter-state trade or commerce either under Section 3(a) or under Section 3(b). The words during
such movement in Section 6(2) suggest that the goods are in movement i.e the goods have
commenced movement in one State, but have not completed its movement in the other State. The
movement of goods is deemed to commence at the time of delivery of the goods to, and terminate at
the time when delivery is taken from, the carrier. (Sundaram Industries v. State of Tamil Nadu . The
requirement of the subsequent sale being effected by transfer of documents of title, and not by
physical delivery thereof, indicates that the subsequent sale must have been effected after the goods
have commenced movement in one State but have not yet been delivered in the other State.
Similar to a Section 3(b) sale, where sale of goods is effected by a transfer of documents of title to
such goods during their movement from one State to another, the subsequent sale under Section
6(2) must also take place during such movement ie during their movement from one State to
another. Like a Section 3(b) sale, the subsequent sale under Section 6(2) must also be effected by
way of a transfer of documents of title to such goods. The words during their movement are used
both in Section 3(b) and the first limb of Section 6(2). The words such movement in the second limb
of Section 6(2) can only mean during the movement of goods as referred to in the first limb of
Section 6(2), more so as both the first and the second limb of Section 6(2) require the sale to be
effected by transfer of documents of title to such goods during their movement from one State to
another. Where the legislature uses the same word or phrase in similar contexts, in different parts of
the same Section or Statute, there is a presumption that the word is used in the same sense
throughout, and to intend it in each place to bear the same meaning. (Courtauld v. Legh ; Black-
Clawson v. Papierwerke ; Farrell v. Alexander ). Ordinarily, a word or expression used at several
places in one enactment should be assigned the same meaning so as to avoid a head-on clash
between two meanings assigned to the same word or expression occurring at two places in the same
enactment. It should not be lightly assumed that Parliament had given with one hand what it took
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 24M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
away with the other. (Central Bank of India v. Ravindra ; Farrell115; Madras Electric Supply
Corporation Ltd (In Liquidation) v. Boarland (Inspector of Taxes) ).
It is, at all events, reasonable to presume that the same meaning is implied by the use of the same
expression in every part of an Act. (CIT v. Venkateswara Hatcheries (P) Ltd., ; Shamrao Vishnu
Parulekar v. Distt. Magistrate, Thana ; Maxwells Interpretation of Statutes, Edn. 10, p. 522), unless
the context suggests otherwise, (Suresh Chand v. Gulam Chisti ; Raghubans Narain Singh v. U.P.
Government or there is something repugnant in the context, (Bhogilal Chunilal Pandya v. State of
Bombay ), and is a guide which must yield to indications of a contrary intention. (Payne (Inspector
of Taxes) v. Barratt Developments (Luton) Ltd ). There is nothing in the context of either Section
3(b) or Section 6(2) which indicates a contrary intention. Consequently it is only a contract of sale
which comes into existence when the goods are in movement, pursuant to an earlier inter-state sale
either under Section 3(a) or 3(b), which would fall within the ambit of Section 6(2) of the CST Act.
The subsequent sale, exempt under Section 6(2), has a reference only to a sale made during such
movement. In other words, the second or subsequent sale has to be one which falls under Section
3(b) of the CST Act. (Mitsubishi Corporation India P. Ltd. v. VAT Officer (Delhi) ). It must have been
effected before the journey of the goods ends or before the goods reach their destination, and must
fall within Section 3(b). (Voltas Ltd. v. State of Orissa ; G.E.T. Power Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Odisha ).
The conditions discernible from Section 6(2) are that, while the first sale can be either a Section 3(a)
or a Section 3(b) sale, the second or subsequent sale has to be a Section 3(b) sale (Mitsubishi
Corporation India P. Ltd.124) ie it must necessarily have all the other characteristics of a Section
3(b) sale. Like a Section 3(b) sale, a sale under Section 6(2) also takes place during the movement of
goods from one State to another. Again like a Section 3(b) sale the subsequent sale, which is exempt
under Section 6(2), is also effected by transfer of document of title during the movement of goods
from one State to another. While the situs of a Section 3(a) sale can either be in the State from where
the goods move or in the State where the goods are delivered, both a Section 3(b) and a subsequent
sale exempt under Section 6(2) can only take place when the goods are in movement from one State
to another. A contract of sale entered into either before commencement of movement in the first
State, or after completion of movement of the goods in the second State, can neither be a Section
3(b) sale nor a subsequent sale exempt under Section 6(2) of the CST Act.
(iii) IS THE LAW DECLARED BY THE SUPREME COURT, IN A & G PROJECTS &
TECHNOLOGIES LTD. V. STATE OF KARNATAKA BINDING ON THIS COURT?
In A&G Projects & Technologies Ltd.107, the appellant contended that there were three sales, the
second and the third sales were subsequent sales, and they were exempt from tax under Section 6(2)
of the CST Act; this argument of the appellant stood rejected by the assessing authority who held
that the appellants turnover fell under Section 3(a) of the CST Act, all the three sales were Section
3(a) sales, and consequently the appellant was not entitled to exemption under Section 6(2) of the
CST Act. Relying on the proviso to Section 9(1) of the CST Act, the assessing authority held that the
State of Karnataka was competent to levy tax. It is in this context that the Supreme Court held:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 25M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
.Analysing Section 6(2), it is clear that sub-section (2) has been introduced in Section
6 in order to avoid cascading effect of multiple taxation. A subsequent sale falling
under sub-section (2), which satisfies the conditions mentioned in the proviso
thereto, is exempt from tax as the first sale has been subjected to tax under
sub-section (1) of Section 6 of the CST Act, 1956. Thus, in order to attract Section
6(2), it is essential that the sale concerned must be a subsequent inter-State sale
effected by transfer of documents of title to the goods during the movement of the
goods from one State to another and it must be preceded by a prior inter- State sale.
It is only then that Section 6(2) may be attracted in order to make such subsequent
sale exempt from levy of sales tax. However, the proviso to sub-section (2) of Section
6 prescribes further conditions and it is only on fulfilment of those conditions that
the subsequent sale stands exempted. If those conditions are not satisfied, then
notwithstanding the fact that the sale is a subsequent sale, the exemption would not
be admissible to such subsequent sales. This is the scheme of Section 6 of the CST
Act, 1956. (emphasis supplied).
It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that the Supreme Court in A&G Project
and Technologies107 was neither dealing with transactions under Section 3(b) nor
under Section 6(2), but only under Section 3(a); while a general analysis of Section
6(2) of the CST Act was made therein, the Supreme Court neither stated that a
Section 6(2) sale is a Section 3(b) sale nor has it concluded that a contract should
emerge subsequent to movement for a sale to qualify as a transit sale i.e., as a Section
6(2) sale; when it refers to emergence of a contract subsequent to movement, the
Supreme Court has identified this condition only for a Section 3(b) sale, and not a
Section 6(2) sale; and there is nothing in the judgment to show that the sale, under
Section 3(b), cannot have a predetermined customer.
It is no doubt true that the Supreme Court, in A&G Projects & Technologies Ltd107,
proceeded on the premise that all the three sales were Section 3(a) sales.
Nevertheless the scope of Section 6(2) of the CST Act was considered therein. Once a
Judgment is rendered by the Supreme Court, it should not be contended later that a
particular point was not raised or considered by the learned Judges or that it is open
to the High Court to re-consider the same. (Delhi Cloth General Mills v. Shambunadh
; Government of A.P. v. N. Chowdary ).
Even if the scope of Section 6(2) of the CST Act was not in issue in A&G Projects &
Technologies Ltd107, it is nonetheless binding as the High Court is bound even by the
obiter-dicta of the Supreme Court. An obiter dictum, as distinguished from a ratio
decidendi, is an observation by the Court on a legal question suggested in a case
before it, but not arising in such manner as to require a decision. (State of Haryana v.
Ranbir ; ADM, Jabalpur v. Shivakant Shukla ; Girnar Traders76; Divisional
Controller, KSRTC v. Mahadeva Shetty ; Director of Settlements, A.P. v. M.R.
Apparao ). Obiter dicta of the Supreme Court is binding upon other courts in the
country (Sanjay Dutt v. State through CBI, Bombay ) in the absence of a direct
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 26M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
pronouncement on that question elsewhere by the Supreme Court (Oriental
Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Meena Variyal ), and is entitled to considerable weight. (CIT v.
Vazir Sultan & Sons ). We must express our inability to agree with the submission,
urged on behalf of the petitioners, that the scope of Section 6(2), as analysed therein,
need not be followed.
(iv) CAN A CONTRACT OF SALE OF FUTURE GOODS FALL WITHIN THE AMBIT
OF SECTION 6(2) OF THE CST ACT?
It is contended on behalf of the revenue that, in view of Section 4(2)(b) of the CST Act, if the
appropriation of future goods of a contract of sale takes place in the respondent State, the
respondent is entitled to levy tax thereupon as the sale is deemed to take place within the State; the
goods which form the subject matter of the Supply Contracts are future goods and not specific
goods; the title to future goods passes only upon unconditional appropriation; the determination of
passing of title in future goods has to be decided with reference to Section 23 of the Sale of Goods
Act, 1930 (1930 Act for short); and reliance placed by the petitioner on Section 20 of the 1930 Act is
misplaced.
Section 4 of the CST Act is subject to the provisions of Section 3 thereof. The question, whether a
sale is an inter-State sale or not, must be answered with reference to, and on the basis of, Section 3
alone. Section 4 is not relevant to the said question. (Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd.44). If the
transaction of sale satisfies the requirement of Section 3(a) or Section 3(b) it is deemed to be a sale
of goods in the course of inter-State trade or commerce and, by virtue of Articles 269 and 286 of the
Constitution, is beyond the legislative competence of a State legislature to tax. (State of A.P. v.
National Thermal Power Corpn. Ltd., ; S.R. Sarkar106; 20th Century Finance Corpn. Ltd v. State of
Maharashtra ). Section 4(2)(b) of the CST Act is similar to Section 23 of the Sale of Goods Act. While
Section 4(2)(b) of the CST Act deems sale of unascertained or future goods to take place within a
State, at the time of its appropriation to the contract of Sale by the sellSer or the buyer, it is evident
from Section 4(1) that the deeming provision in Section 4(2) is subject to the provisions contained in
Section 3 of the CST Act. If the sale of goods falls within the ambit of Section 3 of the CST Act, it
would then be an inter-state sale notwithstanding that, in terms of Section 4(2)(b), the
unascertained goods were appropriated to the contract of sale within the territorial limits of the
State where the goods were delivered.
The 1930 Act classifies goods into three categories (i) specific goods (ii) future goods, and (iii)
unascertained goods. Specific goods and future goods are defined in Section 2(6) and 2(14) of the
1930 Act. Section 20 of the 1930 Act is applicable only to specific goods. The goods, which are the
subject matter of these contracts, are future goods as they were required to be purchased by the
petitioner-contractor only after the contract was entered into. Section 20 of the 1930 Act applies
only if there is an unconditional contract for sale. In these Writ Petitions the contracts of sale, which
purport to effect the present sale of future goods, are merely agreements to sell, and not a Sale
(Section 6(3) of the 1930 Act). Section 20 stipulates that the time for payment of price can be
postponed. The petitioners supply contracts do not postpone payment, but payment thereunder is
itself conditional on successful erection. Section 23 of the 1930 Act relates to the sale of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 27M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
unascertained goods and its appropriation. Thereunder title, with respect to future goods, passes on
fulfilment of the following conditions (a) the goods must be in a deliverable state, (b) the goods must
be unconditionally appropriated to the contract, and
(c) there must be assent of the buyer if the appropriation is by the seller. The phrase deliverable
state has been defined in Section 2(3) of the 1930 Act to mean buyer under the contract is bound to
take delivery. For sale of future goods to happen, during the course of transit, all the aforesaid
events should take place during the course of movement; if any of these events occur before or after
movement, the title does not pass during movement and, therefore, the sale ceases to be a transit
sale. Future goods are goods which come into existence after the contract of sale is entered into, and
only thereafter can it be moved from one State to another. A contract of sale of future goods would
invariably be entered into prior to commencement of movement.
Sale of unascertained goods can also take place after its delivery in the other State when the contract
requires the buyer to ascertain and, thereafter, to buy the goods. When the movement of the goods
starts, pursuant to a sale, they shed the character of either unascertained goods or future goods. Sale
of goods, by transfer of documents of title during its movement from one State to another, can only
be the sale of specific or ascertained goods (Balabhagas Hulaschand v. State of Orissa ). It is only a
contract of sale of specific goods which can be effected by transfer of documents of title during its
movement, and not a sale of future goods.
Reliance is placed, on behalf of the petitioners, on State of Tamil Nadu v. Bombay Metal Depot ; and
State of Karnataka v. ECE Industries Ltd wherein it was held that where the description of the goods
is clear and the goods, sent in conformity with the description, have been accepted by the purchaser
on the basis that they confirm to the description, there is ascertainment and appropriation of the
goods to the contract; where the goods are ascertainable, and goods of that description are
despatched, then the goods so despatched can be taken as appropriated to the contract
unconditionally; and the circumstance that the purchaser has a right of rejection does not postpone
the transfer of property in the goods. We must express our inability to agree with the declaration of
law in the aforesaid judgments as the Supreme Court, in Salar Jung Sugar Mills Ltd. v. State of
Mysore , held that unascertained goods are distinct from specific or ascertained goods, in the sense
that future goods include goods not yet in existence, or goods in existence but not yet acquired by
the seller; future goods, for the purposes of passing of property, can never be specific; future goods,
if and when sufficiently identified, may be specific goods; goods to be manufactured by the seller are
future goods; under Section 23 of the Sale of Goods Act, when there is a contract of sale of
unascertained goods, no property in the goods is transferred to the buyer unless and until the goods
are ascertained; where there is a contract for the sale of unascertained or future goods by
description, the property in the goods passes to the buyer only when the goods of that description,
and in a deliverable state, are unconditionally appropriated to the contract; and it is this
unconditional appropriation which would pass the property. In National Thermal Power Corpn.
Ltd.,136; and 20th Century Finance Corporation Ltd.137 the Supreme Court held that, where the
goods are not in existence, such transactions may be effected by the delivery of the goods in which
case the taxable event would be on the delivery of goods.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 28M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
In the present batch of Writ Petitions the contracts were entered into, between the owner and the
petitioner-contractor, prior to an order being placed by the petitioner-contractor on suppliers
outside the State for supply of the goods required for installation and erection of the project within
the State of A.P. (now Telangana and A.P.); the supply contracts, between the contractor and the
owner, were for the sale of future goods which were required to be manufactured by the suppliers,
identified in the contract, on an order being placed on them by the petitioner- contractors in terms
of the contract entered into between the contractor and the owner. As the subject contracts provide
for sale of future goods, they could not have been, and were not, entered into when the goods were
in movement from one State to another. A contract for the sale of future goods can neither be a
Section 3(b) sale nor a subsequent sale exempt from tax under Section 6(2) of the CST Act. As the
subject contracts provide for the sale of future goods, the said contracts cannot be said to have
arisen after commencement of movement of the goods i.e., during the movement of the goods from
one State to another. It cannot, therefore, be a subsequent sale exempt from tax under Section 6(2)
of the CST Act.
It is, however, contended on behalf of the petitioners that the subject contracts are merely
agreements to sell which, in turn, provides for the sale of goods when it is in transit from one State
to another. Before a transaction can be considered as a sale, there must be a transfer of property in
goods for, without such a transfer, there cannot be any sale. (Commissioner of Sales Tax, M.P. v.
Purshottam Premji ). The word 'goods' in the definition of 'sale' in a Sales Tax Act must be
interpreted according to its definition therein, and not according to the definition in Section 2(7) of
the Sale of Goods Act. (Commissioner of Sales Tax, Eastern Division, Nagpur v. Husenali Adamji
and Co. ). Section 2(d) of the CST Act defines goods to include all materials, articles, commodities
and all other kinds of actionable claims. Section 2(g) of the CST Act, after its substitution by Act
No.20 of 2002 w.e.f. 11.05.2002, is an inclusive decision. The main part of Section 2(g), (other than
the inclusive part), is similar to the pre- amended Section 2(g) and defines a sale to mean any
transfer of property in goods by one person to another for cash or deferred payment or for any other
valuable consideration.
A transaction of sale is subject to tax under the CST Act on the completion of the sale. A mere
contract of sale is not a sale within the definition of "sale" in Section 2 (g) thereof. (TELCO Ltd.62;
S. R. Sarkar106; Ben Gorm Nilgiri Plantations Co., Conoor v. Sales Tax Officer, Special Circle,
Ernakulam ). In Chem-Dyes Corporation3, the Division bench of the Gujarat High Court held that
one of the conditions for applicability of Section 3(b) is "sale" of goods, and not an agreement to sell;
and both the conditions should be satisfied - sale as well as transfer of documents of title to the
goods - during their movement from one State to another.
Without expressing any opinion on the merits of the submission we shall proceed on the premise
that the subject contracts, which provide for the sale of future goods, is an agreement to sell and the
sale of goods took place subsequent thereto. It is necessary, therefore, to ascertain whether the sale
of goods, by the petitioner-contractor to the owner, took place when the goods were in movement
from one State to another, for it is only then can such a sale fall within the ambit of Section 6(2) of
the CST Act. While examining the contractual provisions in this light, it must be borne in mind that
Courts and tribunals cannot rewrite contracts (LIC of India v. S. Sindhu ) and must read the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 29M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
agreement as it is. The contract must be read as a whole and not be dissected, by taking out a part.
(Shin Satellite Public Co. Ltd. v. Jain Studios Ltd. ). It is the substance of the contract document/s,
and not merely the form, which has to be looked into. (Hindustan Shipyard Ltd. v. State of A.P. ).
It is the case of the petitioners that, in terms of the transit- sale clause in the contract (for instance
clause 5.3.2 of the L&T - Konaseema contract), the sale of goods took place during transit by
effecting transfer of documents of title to the goods. Article 5.3.2
(ii) of the L&T - Konaseema contract stipulates that the sales tax, included in the contract price
stated in Article 5.1, includes central sales tax, leviable on the sale transaction between the supplier
and his sub-supplier/vendors situated outside Andhra Pradesh @ 4% on equipment and materials,
sale of which to the Owner will be effected by the Supplier by endorsing the documents while the
goods are in transit under Section 6(2) of the CST Act; the sale to the Supplier, having taken place in
the course of inter-state trade or commerce, the sale by the Supplier to the Owner shall similarly be
deemed to have taken place in the course of inter-state trade or commerce; and necessary
concessional sales tax forms shall be furnished by the Owner to the Supplier.
The aforesaid clause, and similar clauses in other supply agreements, cannot be read in isolation or
out of context. It is necessary to read the contract as a whole to ascertain whether the parties, in fact,
intended to transfer title to the goods during its movement from one state to another, or after the
goods have landed and have been utilized or incorporated in the works of the owner, bearing in
mind that, in the orders impugned in these Writ Petitions, the respondent-authorities have held that
it does not.
The petitioners rely on the transit insurance clauses, the liquidated damages clauses, and the
bailment/free issues clauses in the subject contracts in support of their submission that the sale of
goods, by the petitioners-contractors to the owners, is only when the goods were in movement from
one State to another. It is necessary, therefore, to examine these contractual provisions.
(v) TRANSIT INSURANCE:
It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that, unless the goods are sold and title
in the goods vest with the owner, there is no obligation on the owner to take and
cover the goods under insurance policies especially transit insurance, the cost of
which is wholly borne by the owner.
Article 13.1 of the L&T - Konaseema contract stipulates that from notice to proceed
date, until the issuance of the site test certificate for the equipment, the Owner
(Konaseema) shall take a combined insurance for transit, erection, and all risks; and
the supplier and its sub-suppliers will be mentioned as a co-insured in the policy to
the extent of marine transit and third party liability insurance. Clause 8.1.1 of the
Seimens Power Grid agreement stipulates that all the equipment and materials, being
supplied by Seimens Ltd, shall be kept completely insured by them at their cost from
the time of despatch from their works, upto the completion of erection, testing and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 30M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
commissioning at site, and taking over of the sub-stations by POWER GRID in
accordance with the Contract.
Ownership of the property is not relevant in so far as insurance of the goods is
concerned. It is not necessary that the person, insuring the interest, must be the
owner of the property. There may be insurance to cover the interest of others.
(Escorts JCB Ltd. v. CCE ; Benjamins Sale of Goods, 4th Edn;
Colinvauzs Law of Insurance, 6th Edn. by Robert Merkin; State of Maharashtra v.
Embee Corporation, Bombay ). Insurance can be taken by a third person on behalf of
another. A seller, in possession of the goods when the property and risks have passed,
may insure his buyers interest. A bailee, apart from its interest, may also insure the
interest of the owner of the property. (Escorts JCB Ltd.148; Chitty on Contracts, 28th
Edn., Vol. 2, Special Contracts, p. 978, Chapter 41, Note 007; Prudential Staff Union
v. Hall ; Hepburn v. A. Tomlinson (Hauliers) Ltd. ).
In Larsen & Toubro Ltd v. State of A.P and State of Tamil Nadu v. Mahindra &
Mahindra Ltd , it was held that the fact that the insurance coverage was borne by the
assessee/supplier, per se, would not stand in the way of its being an inter -State sale.
As ownership of the goods is not determined on the basis of who insured the goods, it
matters little that, in some of the contracts, the goods were insured, for its inter-state
movement, by the owner.
(vi) LIQUIDATED DAMAGES CLAUSES:
It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that the clauses relating to liquidated
damages envisage only recovery of damages from the contractor by the owner; the
supply contract only mandates payment of liquidated damages in case of delay in the
supply of goods; the clauses relating to minimum performance guarantee and
liquidated damages would only reinforce the fact that the title to the goods has
allegedly passed to the owner; the owner can only insist on re-performance and, in
case of failure, to recover damages; there is no obligation on the contractor-supplier
to take back the goods if they are of defective quality; the supply contract enables the
employer to claim liquidated damages for supply of defective goods; a reading of
Sections 4(3) and 4(4) of the 1930 Act would show that (a) it is not as if every
condition would convert a sale into an agreement to sell; Sections 4(3) and 4(4) of the
1930 Act make it clear that any encumbrance or condition, deferring passage of title,
would make the sale conditional, and transfer would take place only upon fulfilment
of the conditions; Section 4(4) amplifies and introduces the nexus test; it is not all or
any conditions, but only such conditions, which need to be fulfilled, subject to which
the property in the goods would be transferred; the condition, if any, should be such
that it encumbers or limits the transfer of title to the goods; none of the clauses,
relied upon by the revenue, encumber transfer of title; the contracts provide separate
parameters for damages to be claimed on the supply of goods and service;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 31M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
compensation is fixed for delay in delivery of goods as per the schedule dates for
individual goods, and is not dependant on service and vice versa; and, in the case of
erection and commissioning, the contract provides for completion of the work in a
defined manner which is on integration of individual goods.
It is contended, on behalf of the revenue, that the liquidated damages clauses in the
supply contracts are not relevant for the purposes of ascertaining whether title has
passed during movement; if the contract has an inspection or a certification clause, or
stipulates a conditional payment, the title does not pass till the said inspection or
certification is given; in all these cases the satisfaction of these conditions only
happens after movement, and not during movement; the 1930 Act makes a clear
distinction between conditions and warranties; breach of warranty only gives a right
to a damages claim but, if there is a breach of a condition, the contract itself can be
repudiated in addition to damages; there is an implied condition that the goods shall
be reasonably fit for the purpose for which the goods are required (Chitty on
Contracts Vol. II at page 1471); the purpose for which the owner is procuring the
goods has been expressly made known to the petitioner at the bidding stage itself;
and, consequently, if the goods are not fit for the purpose, the entire contract can be
repudiated.
Article 8.1.2 of the L&T - Konaseema contract stipulates that, in the event of the
guaranteed delivery dates not being adhered to, due to reasons attributable to the
Supplier (L&T), the Supplier shall pay to the Owner (Konaseema), subject to the
Owner incurring a commercial loss due to the delay attributable to the Supplier,
liquidated damages. Clause 10 of the Seimens Power Grid Agreement provides for
liquidated damages for delay in completion and, thereunder, if Seimens Ltd fails to
complete the successful commissioning of the sub-stations covered under the
contract, within the period stipulated, they shall pay POWERGRID liquidated
damages for the delay. Article -11 of the Seimens RINL agreement provides that
liquidated damages shall be applicable only for late delivery and delay in erection for
reasons solely attributable to the contractor; if the Contractor fails in the due
performance of the contract to deliver any part of the equipment, within the time
fixed by the contract, the Contractor shall be liable to pay liquidated damages; if the
contractor fails to complete the work within the time of completion, the contractor
shall be liable to pay liquidated damages; and, in case of non- achievement of
performance guarantee parameters, imposition of liquidated damages, if any, shall
not exceed 7.5% of the total contract value.
Section 12 of the 1930 Act relates to conditions and warranties. Under sub-section (1)
thereof, a stipulation in a contract of sale, with reference to goods which are the
subject thereof, may be a condition or a warranty. Section 12(2) states that a
condition is a stipulation essential to the main purpose of the contract, the breach of
which gives rise to a right to treat the contract as repudiated. Section 12(3) states that
a warranty is a stipulation collateral to the main purpose of a contract, the breach of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 32M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
which gives rise to a claim for damages but not to a right to reject the goods and treat
the contract as repudiated. Section 12(4) stipulates that whether a stipulation in a
contract of sale is a condition or a warranty depends, in each case, on the
construction of the contract; and a stipulation may be a condition, though called a
warranty in the contract. Section 16 of the 1930 Act relates to implied conditions as to
quality or fitness and, under sub-section (1) thereof, where the buyer, expressly or by
implication, makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are
required so as to show that the buyer relies on the sellers skill or judgment, and the
goods are of a description which it is in the course of the sellers business to supply
(whether he is the manufacturer or producer or not), there is an implied condition
that the goods shall be reasonably fit for such purpose.
The subject contracts, for the supply of goods and erection and installation, have
been entrusted to the petitioners for their acknowledged expertise in executing
turnkey projects. The goods purchased by the petitioners-contractors, for execution
of the turnkey projects, is for its usage as components or parts of the plant, and for its
erection and installation. The owner relies on the skill/judgment of the
petitioner-contractor in the procurement of such goods. The subject contracts
expressly stipulate the purpose for which the goods are required by the owner ie for
its use in connection with the erection and installation of the plant. Even if it is called
a warranty (liquidated damages clause) in the contract, it would nonetheless, in view
of Section 12(4) of the 1930 Act, be a condition. Consequently supply of defective
goods would confer a right on the owner to reject the goods, and to treat the contract
as repudiated, and not merely to claim damages.
Reliance placed by the petitioners, on Sections 4(3) and 4(4) of the 1930 Act, is of no
avail. Section 4 of the 1930 Act explains the distinction between a sale and an
agreement to sell. Under sub-section (1) thereof, a contract for the sale of goods is a
contract whereby the seller transfers or agrees to transfer the property in the goods to
the buyer for a price. Sub-section (2) states that a contract of sale may be absolute or
conditional. Under sub-section (3) where, under a contract of sale, the property in the
goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer, the contract is called a sale, but
where the transfer of property in the goods is to take place at a future time, or subject
to some condition thereafter to be fulfilled, the contract is called an agreement to sell.
Section 4(4) stipulates that an agreement to sell becomes a sale when the time
elapses or the conditions are fulfilled subject to which the property in the goods is to
be transferred.
Section 2(6) of the 1930 Act defines future goods to mean goods to be manufactured or produced or
acquired by the seller after making the contract of sale. An agreement to sell future goods is, in view
of Section 4(3) of the 1930 Act, an agreement to sell and not a contract of sale. In case the contract is
conditional, Section 4(4) stipulates that an agreement of sale becomes a sale when the conditions,
subject to which the property in the goods is to be transferred, is fulfilled. As the quality and fitness
of the goods is, in terms of Section 16(1) of the 1930 Act, an implied condition, failure to fulfil the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 33M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
condition would not result in an agreement to sell becoming a sale, and the property in the goods
would not pass from the petitioner-contractor to the owner. Transfer of title to the goods, as shall be
elaborated hereinafter, passes only after post-delivery inspection of the goods, on completion of its
erection and installation in the turn-key project, and on a take over certificate being issued by the
owner to the petitioner-contractor thereafter. As compliance with these conditions, by the
petitioners-contractors, take place only after completion of movement of the goods, the liquidation
damages clause in the subject contracts would not bring the sale within the ambit of Section 6(2) of
the CST Act. The finding recorded by the revenue in this regard, in the impugned orders, cannot be
said to be perverse necessitating interference under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
(vii) BAILMENT/FREE ISSUES CLAUSES:
It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that the petitioners effect inter-state sale
and transit sale of goods to the owners in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh; in terms of
the contract, these goods are handed over as free issue materials to the petitioners for
installation and erection; the petitioner takes care and custody of these free issue
material, acts as an agent or as a bailee of the goods; the goods are handed back to
the owner after installation and commissioning; the concept of free issues is well
recognized in the field of execution of projects or works; tax laws envisage a
non-inclusion or exclusion of the value of such free issue material on the basis that
free issues do not involve sale of goods, and cannot form part of the intrinsic value or
the sale price; bailment does not mean that the goods, originally entrusted, should
alone be returned; it is always subject to the understanding between the parties; in
the present case, the expression bailment has not been expressly used in all the
contracts; some of the contracts contemplate issue of the material, received by the
owner in the course of inter-State trade, to the petitioner for execution under the
service contract; in order to determine whether a sale is taxable or not, a minor
difference between the statutory definition of bailment and the transactions are
immaterial; in almost all the contracts, delivery of the goods were taken by the
respective contractees, and accounted as their excisable stock to avail cenvat credit;
subsequently, they were issued to the petitioner through issue slips as provided under
the Excise Rules; the petitioner, after effecting the sale, can also be treated as an
agent of the contractee for erection and commissioning; the respondent erred in not
considering the clauses in the agreement on the control that the contracting parties
had over the goods, and which required the goods to be issued to the petitioner only
as a bailee for the execution of the project; the bailment/material issue certificate,
which are understood as free issues, do not stipulate restoration of the goods in the
very same condition; and unless the goods are sold to the owner, and title to the
goods passes to the owner, the owner cannot issue equipment or material as free
issues.
It is submitted, on behalf of the revenue, that there cannot be a pre-existing bailment
agreement as such an agreement can be entered with the bailor (owner) only when
the bailor is in possession of the goods; the essence of a bailment is a transfer of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 34M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
possession, and not ownership; and the contract of bailment would require the goods
to be returned in the very same condition, and not in a completely different form;
while the owner is said to have entrusted different goods to the
petitioners-contractors, what was returned to them was a completed turn-key project.
Article 2.1.1 (B) of the L&T Konaseema Erection Contract stipulates that the scope of
the contract shall include, in relation to erection, commissioning and testing of
equipment free-issues to the contractor by the owner; to receive such equipment,
from the owners contractor for transportation on behalf of the owner, at the facility
site; and to store at the facility site as designated by the owner under the terms and
conditions of bailment. In terms of the Alstom GVK contract, a material
received/issued certificate is prepared under which the material is handed over for
storage, erection and commissioning. Clause 2.3 (iii) of the Seimens Power Grid
agreement stipulates that, for the equipment & materials to be provided by Seimens
under the First Contract, it would be the responsibility of Siemens to take delivery,
unload and store the same at the site and execute an Indemnity Bond in favour of
POWER GRID against loss, damage and any risks involved for the full value of the
equipment/materials; and the indemnity bond shall be valid till the commissioning
and handing over of the sub-station(s) to POWERGRID. Clause 9.3.3 of the Seimens
- RINL agreement stipulates that, on receipt of delivery advise/lorry receipt/railway
receipt, the Engineer or his authorised representative shall endorse the same to the
Contractor for taking delivery of the goods on submission of bailment agreement by
the Contractor as per Appendix 10, to store them in his site store and to take custody
of them until they are erected and handed over to the Employer (owner).
Section 148 of the Indian Contract Act stipulates that a bailment is the delivery of
goods by one person to another for some purpose, upon a contract that they shall,
when the purpose is accomplished, be returned or otherwise disposed of according to
the directions of the person delivering them. The person delivering the goods is called
the bailor. The person to whom they are delivered is called the bailee. Section 160
relates to the return of goods bailed on expiration of time or accomplishment of
purpose and, thereunder, it is the duty of the bailee to return or deliver, according to
the bailors directions, the goods bailed, without demand, as soon as the time for
which they were bailed has expired, or the purpose for which they were bailed has
been accomplished.
If the intention and result of the contract is to transfer for a price property in which
the transferee had no previous property then the contract is a contract of sale. Where,
however, the passing of property is merely ancillary to the contract for the
performance of work such a contract does not thereby become a contract of sale.
(Benjamin's Treatise on the Law of Sale of Personal Property, Eighth Edition (1950).
Bailment is a delivery of goods in trust upon a contract, expressed or implied, that the
trust shall be faithfully executed on the part of the bailee. Wherever there is a delivery
of property on a contract for an equivalent in money or some other valuable
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 35M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
commodity, and not for the return of the subject matter in its original or an altered
form, it is a transfer of property for value it is a sale and not a bailment. (The South
Australian Insurance Company v. William Beavis Randell and Samuel Randell ). The
test is whether the identical subject matter was to be restored either as it stood or in
an altered form; or whether a different thing was to be given for it as an equivalent
for, in the latter case, it is a sale and not a bailment. (William Beavis Randell and
Samuel Randell154; Indian Metal and Metallurgical Corporation v. State of Madras ;
M.M. Traders v. State of M.P. ).
When the petitioner and the owner entered into the subject agreement, neither the
petitioner nor the owner were in possession of the goods, as the goods had to be
acquired thereafter from the supplier. It is difficult, therefore, to hold that it is a
bailment agreement. As is evident from Section 148 read with Section 160 of the
Indian Contract Act, a bailment contract entails the return of goods in an identical
form. After entrustment of the goods, and after the purpose of entrustment is
accomplished, the goods must either be returned or otherwise disposed of according
to the directions of the bailor. While some alteration of the goods is permitted, the
identity of the original goods cannot be destroyed or substituted by the bailee. In the
present case the goods, allegedly given under bailment by the owner to the
petitioner-contractor, were in the raw form, and in return the owner received a
finished product in the form of an erected power plant. In an alteration, the identity
of the original goods is not destroyed. For instance when a car is sent for repair, the
contractual relationship is one of bailment. If, for instance, the clutch plates of the car
are replaced, the identity of the car is not lost, though the repair has resulted in an
alteration. It is evident that, in the subject contracts, the identity of the original goods
was lost in the process, the goods originally entrusted were not returned in the same
or altered form, and notwithstanding the form in which the clause is couched there is,
in substance, no bailment.
The concept of free issues is based on the premise that the owner has entrusted the
goods to the contractor for being used or utilized in the works executed by the
contractor for the benefit of the owner. It is true that, in computation of sales tax, the
net sale price, excluding the cost of free issue material, alone should be taken into
consideration. Ordinarily the price paid, to the dealer selling the goods, would not
include the value of the free issue material. (V.S. Engineering (P) Ltd. v. State of A.P.
). As shall be detailed hereinafter, the intention of the parties, as is evident from the
certification and other clauses of the contract, is to effect transfer of title to the goods
from the supplier-contractor to the owner only after inspection and issuance of the
taking over certificate ie after completion of erection of the plant. Reliance placed on
behalf of the petitioners on the bailment clauses/free issue certificates is, therefore,
of no avail.
(viii) TITLE CLAUSES IN THE SUPPLY CONTRACTS:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 36M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that Article 5.3.2 of the L&T Konaseema
supply contract would govern, as the other clauses in the agreement can be read
harmoniously therewith; the odd reference, of full payment for transfer of title, under
Article 17 of the contract, has to be subsumed only as an irrelevance, and an out of
context reference, as this condition does not gel with any other clause in both the
agreements. It is contended, on behalf of the revenue, that the question of passing of
title should be ascertained by construing the contract as a whole and the surrounding
circumstances, and not merely the title clause; even otherwise, the title clause in the
L&T - Konaseema Supply contract shows that title passes at the time of incorporation
and not during movement; the title passes, under the L&T Vemagiri, Alstom Supply
Contracts and Siemens title clauses, only when the seller dispatches the goods i.e.,
prior to movement.
Clause 17 of the L & T Konaseema supply contract stipulates that the legal title to the
property in the equipment shall be deemed to have been transferred from the
supplier to the owner when the equipment has been delivered to the owners
contractor for transportation (carrier), subject to transfer by the contractor to the
owner of the carriers receipt or any other document of title to the goods endorsed by
the Supplier in favour of the owner, and full payment thereof by the owner. The
supply contract provides for full payment only after a site test certification is issued
by the owner after inspection and successful erection. Clause 17 thus makes it clear
that title to the goods does not pass during movement. Under clause 11.1 of the L & T
Vemagiri agreement, title to all indigenous equipment shall pass to the owner upon
the earlier of (a) payment of a part or whole of the indigenous equipment or (b) when
delivered to the transportation contractor or
(c) the time that title to the indigenous equipment passes from the onshore supply
sub-contractors to the onshore supplier. The payment schedule is prescribed in
Appendix-H of the agreement and, thereunder, 10% of the onshore supply contract
price is to be paid as advance payment. The words part payment in Appendix H
would bring within its ambit advance payment also.
Title to the goods, thus, passes even before commencement of movement.
Clause 22.1.3 of the Alstom GVK and Alstom Goutami Supply Contract stipulates that the title to
supplies (ex-works) shall pass to the owner upon the earlier of payment in full therefor, or when
delivered to the carrier ex-works Indian Factory; and 5% of the supply contract price shall be due at
the occurrence of the provisional acceptance of the facility in accordance with Clause 4.2.2 of the
agreement. It is evident that, under the title clause, title passes either upon full payment (which is
after the successful erection i.e., after completion of movement), or delivery to the carrier ex-works
(i.e., prior to commencement of movement). Title does not pass under the aforesaid agreement
during movement from one State to another. Clause 2.3 (iii) of the Siemens Power Grid contract
stipulates that the title, of the equipment and materials to be supplied by Siemens to Power Grid,
shall pass on to Power Grid on ex-works despatch and with negotiation of despatch documents. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 37M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
said clause also stipulates that transfer of title shall not relieve Siemens from the responsibility for
all risks of loss or damage to the equipment and materials till its taking over by Power Grid, as
specified in the bidding document. That the supplier is held responsible for risk, loss and damage of
goods till they are taken over by the owner shows that the parties intended, in terms of Section 26 of
the 1930 Act, that title would pass to the owner only after completion of movement. If parties really
intended otherwise, the supplier would then have been absolved of all responsibility after despatch
of goods ex-works.
Under the L & T Konaseema supply contract, full payment is made only after a site test certificate is
issued by the owner after inspection and successful erection. Likewise, under Alstom supply
contracts, title to the goods passes either upon payment for supply in full (which is only after
completion of erection) or when the goods were delivered to the carrier ex-works Indian factory ie
prior to commencement of movement. Under the Seimens Power Grid supply contract the
responsibility for all risk, damages and losses relating to the goods continue with the supplier till the
goods are taken over by Power Grid (after erection) despite title allegedly passing on ex-works
despatch with negotiation of despatch documents. A transit sale, to be exempt under Section 6(2) of
the CST Act, is a sale whereby transfer of title to the goods takes place when they are in movement
from one State to another. The aforesaid title clauses show that the parties intended to transfer title
to the goods either before commencement of its movement in the State where they were purchased
by the petitioner-contractor, or after its delivery in the State where the works were being executed
by the contractor for the Owner. In either event, transfer of title to the goods does not take place
when the goods are in movement from one State to another.
(ix) INSPECTION AND CERTIFICATION CLAUSES:
It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that the site performance test and the
performance guarantee test, envisaged in both the agreements, only mandate a
re-performance by the contractor so as to ensure no defects or liabilities, and to
achieve minimum performance guarantee; in case of failure, it entitles the owner to
reject and recover cost; even in a normal sale of goods, an inspection clause would be
found, but that does not postpone the sale; the mere fact that there is an inspection
prior and post- dispatch would not destroy the inter-State character of the sale;
inspection at the sellers premises, and also at the premises of the buyer, is a common
commercial feature; reliance placed by the revenue on Usha Beltron Ltd. v. State of
Punjab , is misplaced, as it is not under the CST Act; the nexus test i.e, the conditions,
if any, should encumber or postpone the transfer of title under Section 4(4), and the
fact that passage of title and risk need not be concurrent and is left to the contracting
parties, as envisaged in Section 26 of the 1930 Act, were neither brought to the notice
of the Court nor argued; the final performance test would not delay transfer of title to
the goods; inspection is pre-delivery and prior to sale; if the goods are rejected, no
sale takes place; if goods are approved, the same are sold inter-state; and the only
requirement is to verify the actual receipt of stock, post the sale.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 38M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
It is contended, on behalf of the revenue, that the inspection and certification clauses
show that title has not passed during movement; most of the subject supply contracts
stipulate not only a pre-despatch inspection, but also a post despatch inspection; in
all these contracts the supplier becomes entitled to a portion of the payment only if
the inspection is successful; the certification clauses in the L&T Konaseema Supply
Contract, L&T Vemagiri Onshore Supply Contract, and Siemens Power Grid Contract,
show that, in addition to post-despatch inspection, the supply contracts (as opposed
to the erection contracts) also contemplate a certification after erection; by virtue of
the said clause, the owner certifies as to the successful operation of the facility; the
said certification is given after the owner inspects the facility, and finds that all the
units and components, which have been supplied, are working; the scope of
certification extends not only to the civil work, but also to the goods supplied under
the supply contract; in all the contracts, the supplier becomes entitled to full payment
only upon receipt of such certification; the payment is linked to successful inspection
and certification; if the contract has an inspection or a certification clause, title does
not pass till the inspection and certification are successful, and the buyer / owner has
indicated his approval; the Supreme Court, in Usha Belltron158, held that title passes
only upon certification; and the petitioners contention that the taking over certificate
was merely for ensuring proper quality of goods supplied, and does not relate to
passing of property in the goods, is not tenable.
Clause 7.2.1 of the L&T Konaseema supply contract records the agreement of the
supplier for the goods to be tested, and to be approved to perform the site test on the
materials. The site test procedures, prescribed in Appendix-I of the said contract,
includes the reliability test to demonstrate that the materials can continuously
operate safely, and without failure, at design conditions and requires it to work on
continuous operation for seven days at various loads and modes of operation. Clause
2.10.5 of the L & T Vemagiri onshore supply contract stipulates that, if as a result of
inspection, examination, testing or re-testing, it is found that the onshore supply is
defective, or otherwise not in accordance with the agreement, the owner may reject
such onshore supply. The clause requires the onshore supplier, following any such
rejection, to replace or otherwise repair such goods. Clause 6.13.1 of the L & T
Vemagiri supply contract provides for final acceptance and, thereunder, final
acceptance of the plant is achieved after provisional acceptance of the plant has been
achieved; and, in case the civil contractor has adopted the corrective action plan,
after provisional acceptance and any corrective and remedial action has been taken in
respect of the plant. Clause 2.2.28 of the Seimens RINL agreement requires the
Contractor to carry out the relevant performance tests; and on satisfactory
completion of the performance tests, the employer (owner) is required to issue to the
Contractor a provisional acceptance certificate as per the provision of the General
Conditions of the Contract.
In Usha Beltron Ltd.158, the petitioner contended that the property in the goods had passed to the
Government of India before it entered the Municipal limits; this was a contract for sale of specific
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 39M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
goods in a deliverable state; the property in the goods passed to the buyer when the contract was
made; and it was immaterial as to what was the time of delivery of the goods. Clause 5.5, of the bid
document therein, provided for the issue a taking over certificate when the performance tests had
been successfully carried out; and, while issuance of such a certificate would certify receipt of goods
in a safe and sound condition, it would not discharge the supplier of their warranty obligations.
Clause 6.1 of the bid document stipulated that delivery of the goods shall be made by the supplier in
accordance with the terms of the contract; and the goods were to remain at the risk of the supplier
until delivery was completed. The Supreme Court held that clause 5.5 and 6.1 of the bid document
clearly indicated that the property in the goods remained at the risk of the appellant till delivery was
completed; it showed that delivery would be completed only after the take-over certificate was
issued; as per Section 19 of the Sale of Goods Act, the property in the goods passes when the parties
intended it to pass; in this case the contract provided that property in the goods does not pass till
after delivery, and after successful testing and issuance of the take-over certificate; and the High
Court was right in concluding that the property in the goods had not passed at the time the goods
entered the municipal limits.
In Chem-Dyes Corporation3 the assessee purchased goods from Bombay, despatched them to
Rajkot, and handed over the railway receipts to the purchasers of the goods at Rajkot. These
purchasers, after taking delivery of the goods from the railways, carried out inspection and then
made payment for the goods. The Tribunal held that, as per the relevant terms of agreement, all
supplies of goods were subject to checking and approval by the purchasers; the purchasers had the
right to reject the goods, at the cost of the assessee, even after taking delivery; there was no sale till
the purchasers took delivery of the goods, inspected and ultimately approved them; at the time of
endorsement of the railway receipts, in favour of the purchasers, the purchasers were neither
required to pay nor had they paid any part of the purchase price of the goods to the assessee; the
purchasers had paid the price of the goods to the assessee only after they had checked the goods,
and found that they were in order; when the railway receipts were endorsed in favour of the
intending purchaser by the assessee, the sale did not take place; the sale took place only after the
goods reached the destination, and were inspected and approved by the purchasers; and the
provisions of Section 3(b) of the CST Act were not attracted. The Division bench of the Gujarat High
Court held that there was nothing to indicate that the intending purchasers had entered into an
agreement to sell in which there was a stipulation regarding transfer of the property in the goods;
and the property in the goods had passed only after the goods had reached the destination at Rajkot,
after the intending purchaser took delivery and, thereafter, inspected and approved the same.
Section 23 of the 1930 Act stipulates that title, in a sale of future goods, passes only when the goods
are in a deliverable state, they are unconditionally appropriated to the contract, and there is assent
of the buyer. If the contract has a post-delivery inspection or a certification clause, the unconditional
appropriation, ordinarily, takes place, and the assent of the buyer is also given, only upon inspection
and certification. Under Section 24 of the 1930 Act title passes upon approval which, in the subject
contracts, is only after inspection. The post-delivery inspection clauses in the subject contracts
would fall within the ambit of the phrase on approval in Section 24 as delivery of the goods is taken
only after inspection. The taking over certificate also shows that the buyer indicates his approval
only after certification. The inspection and certification clauses in the contract would fall within the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 40M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
ambit of the phrase other similar terms in Section 24. The presence of an inspection and
certification clause in the supply contract defers passing of title till the owner has expressed its
assent. Such assent is given only after inspection and certification.
The law declared by the Supreme Court, in Usha Beltron Ltd158, is binding on this Court. It is not
for the High Court to distinguish a binding precedent on the specious plea that certain aspects were
not noticed by the Supreme Court. Even otherwise, reliance placed on behalf of the petitioners, on
Section 26 of the 1930 Act, is misplaced. Clause 2.3 (iii) of the Seimens Power Grid contract makes it
clear that, notwithstanding that title would pass to Power Grid ex-works despatch and with
negotiation of despatch documents, the responsibility for all risk of loss and damage to the goods
continued with the Seimens Ltd till its taking over by Power Grid on completion of erection of the
plant. Section 26 stipulates that risk, prima-facie, passes with the property and, thereunder, unless
otherwise agreed, the goods remain at the sellers risk until the property therein is transferred to the
buyer, but when the property therein is transferred to the buyer, the goods are at the buyers risk
whether delivery has been made or not. Section 26 is not attracted where the contract provides
otherwise. While the question, as to when title to the goods is transferred from the seller to the
buyer, must be determined from the conditions stipulated in the subject contracts, if the parties
have agreed that the responsibility for risk of loss and damage to the goods would be that of the
supplier till erection of the plant is completed, it is evident that transfer of title to the goods was
intended to pass only on erection, and not prior thereto.
Section 41(2) of the 1930 Act stipulates that, unless otherwise agreed, when the seller tenders
delivery of the goods to the buyer he is bound, on request, to afford the buyer a reasonable
opportunity of examining the goods for the purpose of ascertaining whether they are in conformity
with the contract. Section 42 relates to acceptance and, thereunder, the buyer is deemed to have
accepted the goods when he intimates to the seller that he has accepted them, or when the goods
have been delivered to him and he does any act in relation to them which is inconsistent with the
ownership of the seller. The post-delivery inspection clauses, in the supply contracts, are in
conformity with Section 41(2), and the certification clauses therein accord with the requirement of
Section 42 of the 1930 Act.
The aforementioned clauses of the L & T, Siemens and Alstom supply agreements provide for
performance of a site test of materials, inspection and testing, for rejection of the goods by the
employer if the goods are found defective on inspection and testing, for a part of the price of the
supplies to be made after testing and issuance of a taking over certificate, and for payment under the
supply contract being conditional on performance acceptance under the service contract. The
unconditional appropriation of the goods to the contract by the buyer, with the assent of the seller,
under the subject contracts takes place only after the goods are tested after delivery at the site, and
on performance acceptance and issuance of a taking over certificate. As acceptance of the goods by
the buyer takes place only post-delivery within the State, the transfer of title does not take place
during movement of the goods from one State to another, notwithstanding the transit sale clause in
some of the subject contracts. As transfer of title to the goods does not pass to the employer, during
movement of the goods from one State to another, the sale of goods, under the subject contracts, is
not a transit sale and rejection of the petitioners claim for exemption, under Section 6(2) of the CST
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 41M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
Act, by the respondents-authorities cannot be faulted.
(x) PAYMENT ON MILESTONE BASIS:
It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that Section 2(g) of the CST Act
recognises that a sale is also occasioned by deferred payment of the amount due; the
terms of payment as agreed upon, and the passing of title, are independent of each
other; transfer of title is not kept in abeyance merely because payment is deferred;
the contention, that a sale is not complete till final payment is made, if accepted,
would defeat the very foundation of sales tax law that transfer is complete - whether
the seller receives consideration or not; whatever restrictions apply to a normal sale,
would equally apply to a deemed sale; the payment terms are not milestones;
percentage-wise payment terms have been provided for supply of goods; as the
balance payment is to be paid on completion of commissioning, it implies that the
goods have to perform on commissioning; there is a major difference in Private and
Govt Contracts; Government Contracts link the balance 5% or 10% payment, through
a cross fall breach clause, for performance of the goods supplied; in private contracts
the same would be decided through mutual discussion or arbitration, and on
determination of the parties responsible for the default; payment or non-payment
does not defer passage of title; failure to perform the service obligations may require
a repeat of the performance to the satisfaction of the employer or, at best, result in
withholding of payment; and this does not defer transfer of title which takes place,
without any limitation, during transit.
It is contended, on behalf of the revenue, that the conditional payment clauses show
that title does not pass during movement; price is the essential characteristic of a
sale; Price is the lynchpin of the definition of sale under Section 4(1) read with
Section 2(10) of the 1930 Act; one of the essential characteristics of a sale is that the
seller is entitled to payment only upon passing of title; if the Seller does not receive
payment even after title in the goods has passed, the seller is entitled to maintain a
suit for price under Section 55 of the 1930 Act; in the present case, the petitioners
contend that title has passed during movement; consequently the petitioners should
be entitled to complete payment after passing of title; but, under the Supply Contract,
payment is made only upon successful erection; the petitioner-seller cannot maintain
the suit for price, even after all the goods are supplied in a fit condition; if the
erection is not successful, the seller is not entitled to payment at all; title passes only
when the petitioner becomes entitled to payment after successful erection; title
passes only after erection and not during movement; conditional payment is not
deferred payment; an instalment payment can be characterised as a deferred
payment because there is certainty of payment; and, unlike an instalment payment,
the factum of payment in these contracts is subject to the satisfaction of a condition,
and is uncertain.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 42M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
As noted hereinabove it is the petitioners case that the subject contract is merely an
agreement to sell for, if it is treated as a contract of sale, the contract, not having
come into existence during the movement of goods from one State to another, would
not fall within the ambit of Section 6(2) of the CST Act. A contract of sale of goods
may be defined as a mutual agreement between the owner of the goods and another
that the property in the goods shall, for some price or consideration, be transferred to
the other, at such a time and in such a manner, as is then agreed. (Indian Metal and
Metallurgical Corporation155). In order to constitute a sale, it is necessary that there
should be an agreement between the parties for the purpose of transferring title to
the goods, it must be supported by money consideration and, as a result of the
transaction, the property must actually pass in the goods. Unless all these elements
are present, there would be no sale. (Gannon Dunkerley & Co. (I)64; Hindustan
Aeronautics Ltd.65; and Member Board of Revenue v. Swaika Oil Mills ).
Section 4(1) of the 1930 Act stipulates that a contract of sale of goods is a contract
whereby the seller transfers or agrees to transfer the property in the goods to the
buyer for a price. Section 2(10) of the said Act defines price to mean the money
consideration for a sale of goods. Under Section 4(3) thereof, where the transfer of
property in the goods is subject to some conditions thereafter to be fulfilled, the
contract is called an agreement to sell which, under Section 4(4), becomes a sale
when the conditions, subject to which the property in the goods is to be transferred,
are fulfilled.
Clause 6.1(iii) of the Siemens Power Grid supply contract stipulates that the balance
80%, of the ex-works price component of the equipment and materials, shall be paid
progressively on certification of the engineer. From out of this 80%, 10% of the ex-
works price component is to be paid only on successful completion of erection,
testing and commissioning of the sub-station and issuance of the taking over
certificate. Clause 4.2.2 of the Alstom GVK and Alstom Goutami supply contract
provides that upon provisional performance acceptance of the facility, as set forth in
the Services Contract, the remaining portion of the Contract Price shall be paid to the
supplier. Payment under the supply contract is conditional on performance
acceptance under the services contract. Similar clauses are to be found in the other
supply contracts as well, and the aforesaid clauses have been referred to as
illustrative of similar clauses in all the supply contracts. The aforesaid clauses show
that a part of the price, to be paid for supply of the goods, is conditional on successful
completion of erection, testing and commissioning of the plant, and issuance of a
taking over certificate. In other words, if the condition is not fulfilled, ie the plant is
not successfully erected, the owner is not contractually obligated to pay that part of
the price which is conditional on successful erection of the plant.
Under Section 55(1) of the 1930 Act where, under a contract of sale, the property in
the goods has passed to the buyer, and the buyer wrongfully neglects or refuses to pay
for the goods according to the terms of the contract, the seller may sue him for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 43M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
price of goods. On the property in the goods passing to the buyer (owner), the seller
(petitioner-contractor) can sue the buyer for the price if the buyer wrongfully neglects
or refuses to pay the price. The right to sue the owner for the price accrues to the
contractor only after the property in the goods passes to the owner which, in terms of
the clauses aforementioned, is only after successful completion of erection, and not
prior thereto. This clause also makes it clear that the parties to the contract did not
intend that the property in the goods would pass from the petitioners-contractors to
the owners when the goods were in movement from one State to another.
Price is as an essential element of a contract of sale of goods. It is only a transfer of
property in goods for cash or deferred payment or any other valuable consideration
which constitutes a sale under Section 2(g) of the CST Act. Blacks Law Dictionary
defines deferred payment as a principal and interest payment which is a postponed
and instalment payment. The essential characteristics of a deferred payment is that,
while there is certainty of payment, the payment is postponed. While the buyer is
bound to make payment, a contract may provide for deferred payment, enabling
payment to be postponed to a date even after title to the goods have passed. The
essential distinction between a deferred payment and fulfilment of conditions after
which payment is to be made must be borne in mind. While there is certainty of
payment, and the date of payment is alone postponed, in the former, the payment is
uncertain in the latter for, failure to fulfil the conditions, would mean that there is no
sale of goods, and the owner is under no obligation to make payment. The contractor
can only take back the goods, and cannot sue for price. It is only a sale of goods which
can be subjected to tax under the CST Act, and not an agreement to sell which does
not eventually result in a sale of goods.
(xi) WHEN DOES TITLE TO THE GOODS PASS FROM THE CONTRACTOR TO
THE OWNER?
It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that, if the goods are said not to have been sold and the
title to the goods as not to have passed to the owner till accretion or incorporation, none of the
clauses ie transit-insurance, free issues and liquidated damages clauses would have existed the way
it had been contracted for; if the title has to pass on accretion or incorporation, as contended by the
revenue, then the cost of insurance should have been borne by the contractor; equipment and
material would not have been received on a free issue basis; and, if title has not passed, there would
be no clause on liquidated damages as the contractor would be free to take back the goods; the title
to the goods passes in transit, and during movement by way of an endorsement; for non-payment,
the petitioner cannot take back the equipment already supplied; and, in the present case, the parties
have clearly understood that the title passes upon delivery of the goods, or payment of price in full,
whichever is earlier.
It is contended, on behalf of the revenue, that the timing of passing of title has to be ascertained by
construing the subject contracts; merely because the parties say that title passes at a particular time
does not, by itself, mean that title has passed at the said time; the description given by the parties is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 44M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
relevant, but is not decisive; the passing of title has to be ascertained by holistically examining the
contract and its various clauses; and, as held in Hindustan Shipyard Ltd.147, the Court should not
only look into the form, but also at the circumstances of the transaction, the custom of the trade,
and the substance of the contract document.
As the scope of Sections 4(3) & (4), 16 and 24 of the 1930 Act have already been dealt with in the
earlier paragraphs, it would suffice to observe that reliance placed by the petitioners thereupon is
misplaced. Section 19(1) of the 1930 Act stipulates that, where there is a contract for the sale of
specific or ascertained goods, the property in them is transferred to the buyer at such time as the
parties to the contract intend it to be transferred. Section 19(2) stipulates that, for the purpose of
ascertaining the intention of the parties, regard shall be had to the terms of the contract, the conduct
of the parties and the circumstances of the case. Section 19(1) relates to specific or ascertained
goods, whereas the goods in the present case are future goods as the petitioner-contractor was not in
the possession of the goods when the supply contract was executed. Section 19(2) indicates that the
time of passing of title has to be ascertained by looking at the terms of the contract, conduct of the
parties, and the circumstances of the case. The Court is required, by Section 19(2), to go beyond the
terms of the contract to ascertain the intention of the parties. In the present case, the terms of the
contract itself show that title has not passed during movement. Section 19(3) of the 1930 Act
stipulates that, unless a different intention appears, the rules contained in Sections 20 to 24 are the
rules for ascertaining the intention of the parties as to the time at which the property in the goods is
to pass to the buyer. As no different intention appears, from a reading of the contract as a whole,
application of the rules contained in Sections 23 and 24 of the 1930 Act shows that the intention of
the parties (the contractor-supplier and the owner-buyer), regarding the time at which the property
in the goods is to pass to the buyer, is only upon completion of erection of the plant and the issue of
a takeover certificate thereafter by the owner, and not when the goods are in movement from one
State to another.
In Husenali Adamji & Co.143 it was contended that the property in the goods passed from the
respondent to WIMCO (consignee) at the railway stations within the Central Provinces as soon as
the logs were loaded on the wagons and the railway receipts were taken out in the name of WIMCO.
The Supreme Court held that Clause 4 of the contract required that the logs should be despatched by
rail from certain stations within the Central Provinces; the contention that this clause had the effect
of passing the property therein to WIMCO, at the railway stations in the Central Provinces, was,
prima facie, sound unless there be some other provisions in the contract to negative this conclusion,
ie that the logs must be carried to Ambernath and delivered there; the cumulative effect of the
provisions of clause 2 that the property in the rejected logs would pass to WIMCO upon the failure
of the respondent to remove the same after rejection, of clause 3 that the goods shall be delivered at
Ambernath in the presence of WIMCO's Factory Manager, and of clause 6 that the prices will be
F.O.R. Ambernath" militated against the theory of passing of property immediately on the goods
being loaded into the wagons; Explanation II to Section 2(g) of the Sales Tax Act would apply only if
the goods " in respect of " which the contract of sale was entered into were, at the date of such
contract, actually in the Central Provinces; the goods, in respect of which the contract of sale was
made, must, at the date of the contract, be in existence in the Central Provinces ie the goods must, at
the date of the contract, be there in the form in which they are agreed to be sold; and there was not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 45M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
an iota of evidence on that point.
The law declared by Supreme Court, in Husenali Adamji & Co143, is that (i) in a contract for sale of
goods, the time of passing of title has to be ascertained on a reading of the contract as a whole; (ii) if
the contract contemplates inspection after delivery, the title passes only upon delivery,
notwithstanding the fact that the contract also contemplates pre-delivery inspection; (iii) in a
contract, for the sale of future goods, title passes only when there has been a unconditional
appropriation of the goods to the contract; consequently, if the contract contemplates post-delivery
inspection, appropriation of the goods to the contract only happens after inspection; and a mere
endorsement on the railway receipts does not transfer title.
The rule of construction, applicable to all written instruments, is that the instrument must be
construed as a whole in order to ascertain the true meaning of its several clauses. Just as a
document cannot be interpreted by picking out only a few clauses ignoring the other relevant ones,
in the same way the nature and meaning of a document cannot be determined by its end-result or
one of the results or the consequences which flow from it. The nomenclature and description given
to a contract is not determinative of the real nature of the document or of the transactions
thereunder. It must be determined from all the terms and clauses of the document and all the rights
and results flowing therefrom, and not by picking and choosing certain clauses and the ultimate
effect or result. (Titaghur Paper Mills Co. Ltd.5; Halsbury's Laws of England, Fourth Edition,
Volume 12, paragraph 1469 at page 602). The contract must be read as a whole, and a single clause,
or a few clauses, in the contract should not be read out of context to determine the intention of the
parties.
A conjoint reading of the various clauses referred to herein above (such as the title clause, the
post-delivery inspection clause, the taking over certificate clause etc.) make it clear that,
notwithstanding the bailment/free issues, and liquidated damages clauses, the parties to the
contract intended that the title to the goods would be transferred from the contractor to the owner
only after erection and commissioning of the plant, and not prior thereto. It is evident, therefore,
that the title to the goods was not transferred during its movement from one State to another, but
only after the goods were incorporated in the works in the State of Andhra Pradesh (now the States
of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh). Consequently the revenue was justified in rejecting the
petitioners claim of the sale of goods, under the subject contracts, being subsequent sales exempt
from tax under Section 6(2) of the CST Act.
(xii) CAN THERE BE AN INTER-STATE SALE IN AN INDIVISIBLE WORKS CONTRACT?
It is contended, on behalf of the revenue, that the facts of the present cases demonstrate that (a)
there was no sale in the course of inter-state movement, as title did not pass during movement; (b)
on a proper construction, the supply and erection contracts demonstrate an indivisible single
composite works contract where title passes during incorporation; there cannot be a transit sale in
an indivisible works contract, since the essential ingredient of a transit sale is that title passes during
movement; and the petitioners have not been able to show a single precedent of a transit sale in an
indivisible works contract.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 46M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
While the submission, urged on behalf of the revenue, that there cannot be a transit sale ( a
subsequent sale exempt under Section 6(2) of the CST Act) in an indivisible works contract has
considerable force, it is wholly unnecessary for us to examine this aspect in adjudicating the issues
which arise for consideration in this batch of writ petitions. Suffice it to hold that, in the indivisible
works contracts, which are the subject matter of these Writ Petitions, the various clauses of the
contracts show that, notwithstanding the transit-sale clause, the parties intended to sell the goods
(ie for the title in the goods to pass) only after completion of erection of the plant, and on issuance
by the owner of a certificate as proof of having taken over the turnkey project.
(xiii) CAN ONE TRANSACTION OF SALE FALL BOTH UNDER SECTION 3(a) AND SECTION 6(2)
OF THE CST ACT?
It is contended, on behalf of the revenue, that a single transaction of sale would not fall both under
Section 3(a) and 6(2) of the CST Act; and, as the petitioners contention that the sale of goods in the
subject contracts fall within the ambit of Section 6(2) of the CST Act necessitates rejection, their
contention that the transaction would also fall under Section 3(a) must be negatived.
Can the very same contract of sale which occasions movement of goods from one State to another,
also result in the sale of the very same goods during its movement from one state to another? Can
the sale of goods to the eventual purchaser, for whose benefit and at whose instance the goods
commence movement from one State to another, fall within the ambit of Section 6(2) of the CST
Act? As noted hereinabove, a Section 3(b) sale can arise only during movement of goods from one
State to another for, otherwise, the inter-state sale would a Sale under Section 3(a) of the CST Act.
Mere movement of goods from one state to another would not suffice. The movement must involve a
sale. For instance, if dealer A purchases goods in State X and transports it to his godown in State Y,
the goods purchased by him in State X is an intra-state sale within State X, and the movement of
goods from State X to State Y is otherwise than by way of a sale as dealer A, who is transporting the
goods purchased by him in State X to his own godown in State Y, cannot be said to have sold the
goods to himself. Such movement of goods is not liable to tax as it is not a sale. If, during such
movement of goods from State X to State Y, dealer A sells the same goods to dealer B, by transfer of
documents of title, then such a sale is an inter-state sale in terms of Section 3(b) of the CST Act. If
the very same goods, during its movement from State X to State Y, are again sold by dealer B (who
purchased the goods from dealer A) to dealer C, again by transfer of documents of title to the goods,
the sale by dealer B to dealer C is a subsequent sale exempt from tax under Section 6(2) of the CST
Act.
Likewise if the movement of goods from State X to State Y is occasioned by the sale of goods by
dealer A to dealer B it is a Section 3(a) sale. If, during the movement of the very same goods from
State X to State Y, dealer B sells them to dealer C, such a sale by dealer B (who purchased the goods
from dealer A) to dealer C is a subsequent sale exempt from tax under Section 6(2) of the CST Act.
If, after delivery of goods in State Y, the very same goods are again sold, and such a sale also
occasions movement of goods from one state to another, then the second sale is also a Section 3(a)
sale, and is not exempt from tax under Section 6(2) of the CST Act. In the illustration given
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 47M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
hereinabove if, after the goods are delivered in State Y, dealer C enters into a contract, for the sale of
the very same goods, with dealer D in State Z, the movement of goods from State Y to State Z is
occasioned by the contract of sale between dealer C and dealer D, and is a second Section 3(a) sale
liable to tax under the CST Act.
The test to determine whether a sale of goods takes place in the course of inter-State trade and
commerce is stipulated only by Section 3 of the CST Act. Section 6(2) merely exempts from tax the
subsequent sale which takes place in the course of inter-state trade and commerce. The nature of the
subject contracts, in the present batch of writ petitions, can be better explained by way of
illustrations. Dealer A enters into a contract with dealer C in State Y that dealer A would purchase
the goods, which dealer C requries, from dealer B in State X; transport the said goods from State X
to State Y; during the course of movement of the goods from State X to State Y, dealer A would sell
the goods to dealer C by transfer of document of title; and, thereby, claim that the sale of goods by
dealer A to dealer C is exempt from tax under Section 6(2) of the CST Act. If, pursuant to the
contract of sale entered into between dealer A with dealer C in State Y, dealer A purchases goods in
State X from dealer B and, as a result, the goods move from State X to State Y, the movement of the
goods is occasioned by the contract of sale between dealer A and dealer C and is a Section 3(a) sale.
If, during such movement, the goods are sold by dealer A to dealer C by transfer of documents of
title, such a sale would not fall within the ambit of Section 6(2) of the CST Act as the same contract
of sale cannot be both a Section 3(a) sale and a subsequent sale exempt from tax under Section 6(2)
of the CST Act. As the movement of goods from State X is only because they were intended to be sold
by dealer A to dealer C in State Y, such a sale is the first inter-state sale liable to tax under Section
3(a) of the CST Act. The person, whose contract of sale with another has occasioned movement of
goods from one State to another in terms of Section 3(a), cannot sell the very same goods to the very
same person again. It is only where the purchaser of goods, under a Section 3(a) or a 3(b) sale, sells
the goods to a third party, would such a sale be a subsequent sale falling within the ambit of Section
6(2) of the CST Act.
A transaction of sale is a single transaction whereby the property in the goods passes through the
seller to the buyer, and there can never be two transactions of sale in one sale. (Kalpana Glass Fibre
Pvt. Ltd.48; Edel Cast India v. Sales Tax Officer ). There can never be two sales between the same
parties under the same contract - one under Section 3(a) and the second under Section 6(2), as a
Section 3(a) sale is the first sale, and the sale exempt under Section 6(2) is the second sale which
takes place when the goods are in continuous movement pursuant to the first sale. As the first sale
cannot, simultaneously, be a second sale also, a Section 3(a) or a 3(b) sale cannot, at the same time,
be a subsequent sale exempt from tax under Section 6(2) of the CST Act.
The intention of the legislature, in a taxation statute, is to be gathered from the language of the
provisions particularly where the language is plain and unambiguous. (Mathuram Agrawal v. State
of M.P. ; Azadi Bachao Andolan98; Bank of Chettinad Ltd. v. CIT Madras ; Motors & General Stores
(P) Ltd103). There is no equity about a tax. There is no presumption as to tax. Nothing is to be read
in, nothing is to be implied. One can only look fairly at the language used. (Mahim Patram Private
Ltd. v. Union of India ; State of West Bengal v. Kesoram Industries Ltd. ). It is no doubt true that, in
case of doubt or ambiguity in the statute, the construction, in favour of the taxpayer and against the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 48M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
Revenue, should be accepted. (Mahim Patram Private Ltd.163; Sneh Enterprises v. Commissioner of
Customs, New Delhi ; M/s Ispat Industries Ltd. v. Commissioner of Customs, Mumbai ). If the
statutory provision does not suffer from any ambiguity, grant of a relief, in the teeth of the express
provisions of the statute to the contrary, is not permissible. On equitable considerations, the Court
cannot ignore or overlook the provisions of the statute. Equity must yield to the law. (Shamsu
Suhara Beevi v. G. Alex ).
On a literal construction, it is evident that a subsequent sale under Section 6(2) is akin to a Section
3(b) sale except that, while a Section 3(b) sale is the first sale in the course of inter-state trade or
commerce, the sale, exempt under Section 6(2), is a second sale. This construction would also
prevent leakage of revenue. The contracts, in the present batch of Writ Petitions, show that the
contractors, with a view to fulfil their obligations under the contract with the owner, have purchased
goods from the supplier at a lower price and, during movement of the goods intended only to reach
the owner, have sold the goods to the owner at a higher price. While tax, under the CST Act, is paid
by the contractor on the purchase of goods from the supplier, no tax is paid by them on the sale of
goods to the owner. As the value of the goods purchased by the contractor from the supplier is far
less than the value of the goods sold by the contractor to the owner, the tax paid under the CST Act
is far lower than what should have been paid if the value of the goods, sold by the contractor to the
owner, is taken as the measure of tax. While a subsequent sale of goods, independent of the first
sale, may also have a similar effect, such a consequence was in the contemplation of Parliament, and
revenue generation was consciously foregone in such cases, to ensure free and unrestricted
movement of goods from one State to another.
As held in the preceding paragraphs, for a sale to be exempt under Section 6(2), the contract of sale
should have come into existence, and the title to the goods should have been transferred, during
movement alone. Any sale of goods prior to commencement of its movement from one State to
another, or after its completion, would not be exempt under Section 6(2) of the CST Act. It is only
for this limited purpose have we examining the elaborate submissions urged by learned counsel on
either side. We may not be understood to have held that the sale of goods, from the
petitioner-contractor to the owner in terms of the subject contracts, is not an intra-state sale for,
even if the sale does not come within the purview of Section 6(2) or Section 3(b) of the CST Act, it
could still fall within the ambit of Section 3(a) of the CST Act.
IV. SECTION 3(a) OF THE CST ACT:
(i) ARE THE PETITIONERS DISABLED FROM CONTENDING THAT THE SALE
OF GOODS UNDER THE SUBJECT CONTRACTS FALL WITHIN THE AMBIT OF
SECTION 3(a) OF THE CST ACT, MERELY BECAUSE THEIR CONTENTION, THAT
THE SUBJECT SALES, FALL UNDER SECTION 6(2) OF THE CST ACT, WAS
REJECTED?
While the submission urged on behalf of the petitioners, that the sale of goods by the
petitioners-contractors to the owner falls within the ambit of Section 6(2) of the CST Act, does not
merit acceptance, are the petitioners thereby barred from contending that, alternatively, these
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 49M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
transactions are sales falling within the ambit of Section 3(a) of the CST Act? Sri K. Vivek Reddy,
Learned Counsel for the respondent, would submit that, since the petitioners have invoked Section
3(a) (without any foundation in the pleadings), and as an alternative argument, the respondents are
making their submissions on the same; the petitioners plea that the second sale may also be treated
as a Section 3(a) sale is destructive of their claim that it is a transit sale under Section 6(2); the
moment the petitioners assert that the second sale is a Section 3(a) sale, it automatically ceases to be
a Section 3(b) sale and a Section 6(2) sale; the petitioners can only assert that the sale is either a
Section 3(a) or a Section 3(b) sale; if the petitioners assert both, it would be a case of mutually
destructive pleading; and, in the face of such destructive pleadings, the petitioners claim that the
second sale is an inter-state sale is not tenable. Reliance is placed by the Learned Counsel on Steel
Authority of India92 and Vimal Chand Ghevarchand Jain96 in this regard.
It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that reliance placed on Section 3(a) is in the alternative,
and is to the effect that the contract with the owner had occasioned inter-State movement of goods
from the other State from known vendors; these are not mutually destructive arguments; reliance
placed on Steel Authority of India92 is misplaced; and, in taxing statutes, alternate arguments can
be raised without prejudice to each other.
The contention, urged on behalf of the respondent, that the petitioners plea that the subject
transactions are exempt from tax under Section 6(2) is mutually destructive of their plea that it is a
Section 3(a) sale, is only to be noted to be rejected. It is no doubt true that pleadings of the parties
are required to be read as a whole; although alternative and inconsistent pleas can be raised, pleas
which are mutually destructive of each other cannot be permitted, (Vimal Chand Ghevarchand
Jain96;
Ranganayakamma v. K.S. Prakash (dead) ), when a definite stand is taken, it would not lie in the
mouth of the petitioner to take a contradictory and inconsistent plea, and to raise a mutually
destructive plea is impermissible in law. (Steel Authority of India92).
It cannot, however, be lost sight of that acquiescence or consent would not confer jurisdiction on the
assessing/revisional authorities to levy tax, under the AP VAT Act, on inter-state sales. In view of
Article 265 of the Constitution, no tax can be recovered which is not permitted by law. The executive
can neither levy tax, (National Mineral Development Corpn. Ltd. v. State of M.P., ), nor can it take
recourse to the process of interpretation of a statute, (Indian Banks Association v. Devkala
Consultancy Service ), to levy tax contrary to law. The consent of parties does not, by itself, confer
jurisdiction upon a statutory authority. It is not open to the parties to confer, by their agreement,
jurisdiction on a Court/Tribunal which it does not possess. The distinction lies in the jurisdiction to
decide matters, and the ambit of the matters to be heard by a Tribunal having jurisdiction to deal
therewith. While, in the latter, the question of acquiescence or irregularity may be considered and
overlooked, in cases where the question is of the jurisdiction of the Court/Tribunal to make the
order, no question of acquiescence or consent can affect the decision. (U.C. Bank v. Their Workmen
; and Hakam Singh v. Gammon (India) Ltd ; Estate Officer and Manager (Recoveries), APIIC Ltd. v.
Recovery Officer, Debts Recovery Tribunal ).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 50M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
Be it a Section 3(a) or a 3(b) or a 5(2) sale or a sale exempt under Section 6(2) of the CST Act, the
respondents lack jurisdiction to subject such sales to tax under the A.P. VAT Act treating them as
intra-state sales. Even if the petitioners had not contended, alternatively, that it is a Section 3(a)
sale, their acquiescence or consent would not confer jurisdiction on the respondents to subject these
transactions to tax under the AP VAT Act. If, from the material on record, it can be established that
the sale is a Section 3(a) sale, then the jurisdiction of the respondent authorities to levy tax on such
sales, under the AP VAT Act, is ousted. While an inter-state sale cannot fall within the ambit of both
Sections 3(a) and 6(2) of the CST Act at the same time, our conclusion, that the subject sales are not
exempt under Section 6(2) of the CST Act, would not bar the petitioners from contending that the
transaction falls within the ambit of Section 3(a) of the CST Act.
(ii) SECTION 3(a) SALE: ITS SCOPE:
It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that the assessing authority did not
dispute the fact that the goods were manufactured to the design and the
specifications of the contracting parties; the transaction would, therefore, qualify as
an inter-state sale by reason of the inter-state movement of goods pursuant to the
contract between the parties which contemplated such movement from outside the
State; after inspection by the contracting parties alone, did the goods start moving;
appropriation to the contract took place outside the State itself, and movement of
goods was from outside the State; the respondent has not denied the fact that the
goods were manufactured and moved as per the terms of the contract; the goods,
involved in the execution of these works contracts, are specific goods tailor made for
the particular project, and are required to be procured only from approved vendors
from outside the State; the petitioner placed orders on the concerned vendors for
manufacture and supply of equipment; after manufacture, inspection and pre-
despatch tests were carried out in the presence of the owner; after satisfactory
inspection, and approval of the test report by the customer, the goods were cleared
for despatch; the vendors handed the goods over to the carrier; there is no diversion
of the specified goods to others; the petitioner could not have offered these goods to
others without committing breach of the supply agreement; and the inextricable link
between the inter-state movement of the goods and the works contract is evident
from the fact that there is a pre- despatch inspection by the contractee/owner or
through his agent.
Sri K. Vivek Reddy, Learned Special Counsel, would submit that the alleged sales,
under the supply agreements, do not satisfy the requirement of a Section 3(a) sale for
the following reasons: (a) movement of goods was pursuant only to an agreement of
sale, and not of sale; (b) even if there was a sale, the sale agreement did not occasion
the inter-state movement; the inter-state movement of goods was pursuant to the
contract between the supplier and the petitioner-contractor, and not between the
petitioner-contractor and the owner; the deeming fiction in Section 3(a) lays down
the following ingredients: (a) there must be a sale or purchase; and (b) the sale or
purchase must occasion the inter-state movement; a sale occasioning inter-state
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 51M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
movement (Section 3(a)), export (Section 5(1)) or import (Section 5(2)), would arise
only if there is privity between the seller and the foreign buyer; if there is any
intermediary to effect the sale, it is not exempt from tax; to overcome the ruling in
Mohd. Serajuddin v. State of Orissa , the Parliament introduced Section 5(3) in the
CST Act which is confined only to exports; the law declared by the Constitution
Benches of the Supreme Court, in Ben Gorm144; Coffee Board v. Jt. CTO ; Binani
Bros v. Union of India and Serajuddin174, continue to hold the field in respect of a
Section 3(a) or a 5(2) sale; if Parliament intended to dispense with the rule of privity,
and thereby include even two sales, it would have extended the scope of the
amendment even to imports and inter-state sales; the interpretation of sale
occasioning movement under Section 3(a) may be summarized as follows: (a) the sale
must be the immediate and direct cause of the inter-state movement of goods; if the
movement was under any other contract, it is not a Section 3(a) sale; (b) there must
be an inextricable link between the contract and the inter-state movement of goods;
(c) there must be privity between the seller and the final purchaser, pursuant to
which there must be inter-state movement of goods; the judgments cited by the
petitioners, in K.G. Khosla & Co. (P) Ltd. v. Deputy Commissioner of Commercial
Taxes, Madras Division, Madras and English Electric Company India v. DCT , are
distinguishable; the judgment in Indure75, was rendered on the peculiar facts and
circumstances of the case, the Supreme Court did not dispense with the requirement
of privity or inextricable relationship as held in the Constitution Bench judgments in
Binani Bros176, Coffee Board_(I)175 and Serajuddin174, the Court did not even
consider the ruling of the Constitution Bench in National Thermal Power
Corporation136), and it did not differ with the ruling in K. Gopinanthan Nair v. State
of Kerala ; the sale, between the petitioner-contractor and the owner, did not
occasion the inter-state movement under Section 3(a) for the following reasons: (i)
the inter-state movement was under the penultimate contract i.e., under the contract
between the supplier and the petitioner-contractor; (ii) the sale contract with the
owner did not immediately cause the inter-state movement; (iii) there was no privity
between the supplier, who was effecting the movement, and the owner who was the
end consumer; and (iv) the supplier- contractor supply contract, and the
contractor-owner contract, are separate and independent contracts.
Let us refer, albeit briefly, to the judgments relied upon by the petitioners. In The
State of Bihar v. Tata Engineering and Locomotive Co. Ltd. , the Supreme Court held
that the dealers of the respondent-company were required, under the contract, to
remove the trucks, purchased by them, from the State of Bihar to places outside
Bihar; they would have committed breach of their contracts, and incurred the penalty
prescribed in their dealership agreements, if they had failed to abide by the terms
requiring them to move the goods outside the State of Bihar; where, under the terms
of a contract of sale, the buyer is required to remove the goods from the State in
which he purchased those goods to another State, and when the goods are so moved,
the sale in question must be considered as a sale in the course of inter-State trade or
commerce; and the ratio of the decision in Coffee Board (I)175, did not bear on the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 52M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
facts wherein, under the terms of the contract of sale, the purchasers were required to
remove the goods from one State to another State.
In Union of India v. K.G. Khosla and Co. Ltd. , the Supreme Court observed that a sale would be an
inter-State sale even if the contract of sale does not itself provide for the movement of goods from
one State to another provided, however, that such movement was the result of a covenant in the
contract of sale or was an incident of the contract. A similar view was expressed in Sahney Steel and
Press Works Ltd. v. CTO ; and National Thermal Power Corpn. Ltd.,136.
In DCM Ltd. v. CST , the Supreme Court held that taking delivery of the goods in Delhi by the
purchasing dealers, for their assigned territories outside Delhi, would not take away the transactions
from the category of inter-State sales; the determinative test to be applied was whether the
purchasing dealers were obliged contractually to remove the goods from Delhi, (in which they were
bought), to the assigned territories; and whether, in fact, the goods stood actually removed.
In Asea Brown Boveri Ltd. v. State of Karnataka , it was contended, on behalf of the revenue, that
movement of the goods from outside the State was neither as a result of the contract nor was it
incidental to the contract; the General Conditions of Contract did not mention about inter -State
vendors; and, therefore, it could not be stated that the goods were moved in pursuance of the
contract. The Karnataka High Court Division bench held that, in the present case, the movement of
goods from one State to another may or may not be as a result of a covenant, but it was definitely an
incident of the contract.
A sale, in the course of inter-State trade, has three essential ingredients: (i) there must be a contract
of sale, incorporating a stipulation, (express or implied), regarding inter-State movement of goods;
(ii) the goods must actually move from one State to another, pursuant to such contract of sale, the
sale being the proximate cause of movement; and (iii) such movement of goods must be from one
State to another State where the sale concludes. (National Thermal Power Corpn. Ltd.,136;
Manganese Ore (I) Ltd. v. Regional Asst. Commissioner ; Balabhagas Hulaschand138). The State
Legislature cannot, by law, treat Section 3(a) sales as sales within the State as it is within the
exclusive domain of the appropriate legislature i.e. Parliament to fix the location of the sale by way
of a legal fiction or otherwise. The State, where the goods are delivered in the transaction of an
inter-State sale, cannot levy a tax on the basis that one of the events in the chain has taken place
within the State. (National Thermal Power Corpn. Ltd.,136; 20th Century Finance Corpn.137;
Builders Association of India v. Union of India ). Whenever a question arises whether a sale is an
inter-State sale or not, it has to be answered with reference to Section 3 alone. (Zunaid
Enterprises47; S.R. Sarkar106).
A sale being, by definition, a transfer of property becomes taxable under Section 3(a) if the
movement of goods from one State to another is under a covenant or incident of the contract of sale,
and the property in the goods passes to the purchaser otherwise than by transfer of documents of
title when the goods are in movement from one State to another. It does not matter in which State
the property passes. (S.R. Sarkar106). The sale must be shown to have occasioned the movement of
the goods from one State to another. The movement must be the result of a covenant or incident of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 53M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
the contract of sale (State of Bihar v. TELCO180; Ben Gorm144; State Trading Corporation of India
Ltd. v. State of Mysore ; K.G. Khosla & Co. (P) Ltd. (I)177; Singareni Collieries Co. v. Commissioner
of Commercial Taxes, Hyderabad ; Sahney Steel and Press Works Ltd.182; State of Orissa v.
K.B.Saha & Sons Industries (P) Ltd. ; TELCO Ltd.62; and the property in the goods may pass in
either State. (K.B.Saha & Sons Industries (P) Ltd.189; Commissioner of Sales Tax v. Bakhtawar Lal
Kailash Chand Arhti ; K.G. Khosla & Co. (II)181; S.R. Sarkar106; Cement Marketing Co. of India v.
State of Mysore ; State Trading Corporation of India187; Singareni Collieries Co.188; State of
Jammu & Kashmir v. Caltex (India) Ltd. ; and Oil India Ltd. v. The Superintendent of Taxes ). What
is decisive is whether the sale is one which occasions the movement of goods from one State to
another. (English Electric Co. of India Ltd.178; National Thermal Power Corpn. Ltd.,136). Such
movement, may be express, implied or incidental but should be inseparably connected with the
transaction. (M.M. Traders156).
Even if the agreement does not expressly provide for movement of the goods, if the parties
envisaged movement of goods, pursuant to the contract, from one State to another, such movement
of the goods is an incident of the contract of sale. It is not necessary that the sale must precede the
inter-State movement in order that the sale may be deemed to have occasioned such movement. (Oil
India Ltd.193; Balabhagas Hulaschand138). It is also immaterial whether the property in the goods
passes in one state or another, (Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. v. Union of India ; S. R. Sarkar106;
Kelvinator of India Ltd. v. The State of Haryana ; English Electric Company of India Ltd.178; Oil
India Ltd.193; State Trading Corporation187; Balabhagas Hulaschand138 and K. G. Khosla & Co. (P)
Ltd. (II)181, or whether a completed sale precedes the movement of goods or follows it. What is
important is that the movement of goods and the sale must be inseparably connected. If the goods
move from one State to another pursuant to an agreement of sale, and the sale is completed in the
other State, it is an inter-State sale. (K.B. Saha & Sons Industries (P) Ltd.189; Bakhtwar Lal Kailash
Chand Arhti190).
In order to occasion the transportation of goods there must exist such a bond, between the contract
of sale and the actual transportation outside the State, that each link is inextricably connected with
the one immediately preceding it. Where the transportation is the result of a sale, the transportation
being inextricably linked up with the sale so that the bond cannot be dissociated without a breach of
the mutual understanding between the buyer and the seller arising from the nature of the
transaction, the sale must be held to be in the course of inter-State trade or commerce.
(Commissioner of Commercial Taxes v. Bhag Singh Milkha Singh ; State of Travancore-Cochin v.
Bombay Co. Ltd., Alleppey ; Ben Gorm144; and State of Travancore-Cochin v. Shanmugha Vilas
Cashew-nut Factory ). If the inter-state movement of goods was within the contemplation of the
parties, and if a reasonable presumption can be drawn that, to fulfill the terms of the contract, such
inter-state movement of goods is necessary, it would fall under Section 3(a) of the CST Act. (ABB
Limited v. Commissioner, Delhi Value Added Tax ). What is important is that the movement of
goods and the sale must be inseparably connected. (K.B. Saha and Sons Industries (P) Ltd.,189).
Even if there is a conceivable link between the movement of the goods and the buyer's contract and
if, in the course of inter- State movement, the goods move only to reach the buyer in satisfaction of
his contract of purchase, and such a nexus is otherwise inexplicable, then the sale or purchase of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 54M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
specific or ascertained goods ought to be deemed to have taken place in the course of inter-State
trade or commerce as such a sale or purchase occasioned the movement of the goods from one State
to another. (English Electric Company of India Ltd.178). Where the transfer invoices denote the
same quantity, and such goods are dispatched to identified customers, these dispatches, from one
State to another to an identified customer, result in an inter-State sale. (Swastik Rubber Products
(P) Ltd. v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, UP ; Bombay Metal Depot139).
Where the movement of goods from one State to another is inextricably connected with the
sale/purchase, the purchase and transport are but parts of one transaction. They cannot be
dissociated, and there is no break between the purchase and the movement of the goods to another
State. It is sufficient if the movement of goods is implicit in the sale, and the sale and movement of
goods are not unconnected and dissociated transactions. (The Co-operative Sugar (Chittur) Ltd. v.
State of T.N. ). The question whether the movement of goods, from one State to another, is as a
result of a covenant in the contract of sale or an incident thereof, will depend on the contract. (State
Trade Corporation of India Ltd.187).
To make the sale, one in the course of inter-State trade or commerce, there must be an obligation to
transport the goods outside the State. The obligation may be of the seller or the buyer and it may
arise by reason of a statute, a contract between the parties, or from mutual understanding or
agreement between them or even from the nature of the transaction which linked the sale to such
transportation. Such an obligation may be imposed expressly under the contract itself or impliedly
by a mutual understanding. It is not necessary that, in all cases, there must be direct evidence
showing such obligation in a written contract or oral agreement. Such obligations are inferable from
circumstantial evidence also. (Bhag Singh Milkha Singh196; Shankerjee Raut Gopalji Raut v. State ).
Each case turns on its own facts and the question is whether, applying the settled principles to the
facts of the present cases, the deemed sale of goods can be said to be inter-state sales. An attempt to
show that some of the factors present in the instant cases are present or absent in some other cases,
in which the sale was held either to be a local sale or an inter-state sale, hardly serves any useful
purpose. (Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.194). In the present batch of Writ Petitions, the link is the
requirement of the supply contracts. Article 3 of the L&T Konaseema supply contract relates to
sub-suppliers. Appendix - E is the list of major suppliers agreed to by the parties, and from which
the contractor shall select for the provision of materials under the contract. The agreement between
Seimens and Powergrid required Seimens to procure items from the suppliers appearing in the
Compendium of Suppliers as agreed to by Power Grid. Article 3.1 of the Alstom- GVK supply
contract refers to Appendix - K which contains a list of suppliers agreed to by the parties, and from
whom Alstom was obligated to select the suppliers.
Clause 2.6.1 of the L&T-Konaseema supply contract confers a right on the owner to depute
personnel to the manufacturers factory to witness test of material as identified in Appendix J to the
agreement. Under the Seimens-Powergrid agreement, Power Grid reserved the right to associate
itself with the inspection of the goods after it is manufactured by the suppliers. Clause 2.1.4 of the
Alstom-GVK supply contract gives an option to GVK or its representative to be present at all
inspections. The aforesaid clauses show that the owner was associated with the goods right from the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 55M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
inception. Not only did they identify suppliers from whom alone the petitioner-contractors were
obligated to purchase the goods, they were also actively involved in other aspects of the supply
(including ensuring quality of the goods supplied), reserving to themselves the right to inspect the
goods at the manufacturers site before commencement of its movement etc. The goods moved from
one State to another, in satisfaction of the contractual obligations of the petitioners-contractors
under the supply contracts, only to reach the site where they were incorporated in the works of the
owner resulting in a sale/deemed sale of goods. The nexus between the transportation of goods from
one State to another is otherwise inexplicable. As there is a conceivable link, between the movement
of goods and its sale, it is an inter-state sale. The inter-State movement is integrally and inextricably
connected to the contract, and the mere fact that the goods were delivered within the State, and
appropriation took place thereat, is of no consequence. It does not matter in which State the
property in the goods passes. What is decisive is whether the sale is one which occasions the
movement of goods from one State to another. (English Electric Co.178).
(iii) SECTION 3(a) OF THE CST ACT: THE WORD SALE USED THEREIN INCLUDES AN
AGREEMENT TO SELL:
It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that, even assuming that the supply
contracts are only agreements to sell, and the sale is not complete until the entire
consideration is paid to the petitioner, such transactions would nonetheless
constitute inter-state sales; sale of goods under Section 3 includes an agreement to
sell; an agreement to sell is also a sale within the meaning of Section 2(g) of the CST
Act; once it is accepted that there is inter-state movement of goods within the
contemplation of all the three parties i.e, the manufacturer/supplier, intermediate
seller and the ultimate buyer and, as a result of the agreement to sell, the contracted
goods move from one State to another, both the first sale and the second sale can only
be inter-state sales.
It is contended, on behalf of the revenue, that, for Section 3(a) to apply, there must be
a contract of sale which results in passing of title; consequently, an agreement of sale
would not fall within the ambit of sale because it does not have the effect of
transferring title; the supply agreements, between the petitioners and the owners, do
not relate to specific goods, but to future goods; since the supply agreement seeks to
pass title in future goods, the said agreement does not result in passing of title in the
goods, and it is only an agreement to sell; the title passes only when the goods have
come into existence, and when the same have been unconditionally appropriated to
the contract; and, consequently, any movement pursuant to the supply agreement,
which is only an agreement to sell, is not a sale occasioning movement.
A purchase made inside a State, for sale outside the State, cannot by itself be held to
be in the course of inter-State trade. (Endupuri Narasimham & Son v. State of Orissa
; Bengal Immunity Company Limited12). To make a sale in the course of inter-State
trade, it is necessary that the contract must envisage the completion of the sale as
well as the movement of the goods to the other State in the course of inter-State
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 56M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
trade. (State of Orissa v. Johrimal Gajanand ). A sale consists of three logical steps -
(i) there is an offer; (ii) there is an agreement to sell when the offer is accepted; and
(iii) in pursuance of the said agreement a concluded sale takes place. When the
statute uses the words "sale or purchase of goods" it automatically attracts the
definition of sale of goods as given in Section 4 of the 1930 Act. (Balabhagas
Hulaschand138). In order to constitute a sale there must be (1) an agreement to sell,
by which alone the property does not pass; and (2) an actual sale by which the
property passes. The definition of a contract of sale, in Benjamin on Sale, (8th Edn.),
includes an agreement to sell as well as an actual sale. (The Sales Tax Officer, Pilibhit
v. Budh Prakash Jai Prakash ; Balabhagas Hulaschand138). An agreement to sell, by
which the property does not actually pass, is also an element of sale. (Balabhagas
Hulaschand138).
After taking note of the judgment of the Supreme Court, in S.R. Sarkar106, wherein it was held that
a transaction of sale is subject to tax under the CST Act on the completion of the sale, and a mere
contract of sale is not a sale within the definition of Sale in Section 2(g), the Supreme Court, in
Balabhagas Hulaschand138, held that the word 'sale' defined in Section 2(g), and used in Section 3
and other Sections of the CST Act, is wide enough to include not only a concluded contract of sale
but also a contract or agreement of sale provided the agreement of sale stipulates a transfer of
property or movement of goods. Judgment of smaller benches of the Supreme Court, interpreting
the judgment of a larger bench of the Supreme Court, is binding on the High Court. (Sakinala
Harinath v. State of A.P. ). As the Constitution bench judgment of the Supreme Court in S.R.
Sarkar106 was considered by the two judge bench of the Supreme Court in Balabhagas
Hulaschand138, the law declared in Balabhagas Hulaschand138, that the word sale used in Section
2(g) and 3 of the CST Act would include an agreement to sell, is binding on the High Court.
In Consolidated Coffee Ltd. v. Coffee Board , the Supreme Court held that what was said in
Balabhagas Hulaschand138 was that the word sale, as used in Section 3 (a) and Section 4(2) (a) and
(b) of the CST Act was wide enough to include not only a concluded contract of sale but also an
agreement of sale provided that the latter stipulated that there was a transfer of property or
movement of goods; and the ratio of that decision was inapplicable to Section 5(3) which dealt with
the question as to when a penultimate sale shall also be deemed to be in the course of export. It is
evident that, atleast for the purposes of Section 3(a) of the CST Act, the word sale would include
within its ambit an agreement of sale also.
In so far as Section 3(a) of the CST Act is concerned, there is no distinction between unascertained
or future goods and goods which are already in existence if, at the time when the sale takes place,
these goods have come into actual existence. (K.G. Khosla and Co. Ltd.181; National Thermal Power
Corpn. Ltd.,136; and Manganese Ore (India) Ltd.185). For the purpose of application of Section 3
(a) of the CST Act, the question whether the contract is a forward contract or not makes no material
difference. (Balabhagas Hulaschand138). The submission of Sri K.Vivek Reddy, Learned Special
Counsel, that movement of the goods, pursuant to the supply contracts, is not a sale occasioning
movement is, therefore, not tenable.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 57M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
The combined effect of Section 3 of the CST Act and Section 4 of the 1930 Act is that an agreement
to sell is also an essential ingredient of sale provided it contains a stipulation for transfer of goods
from the seller to the buyer. If there is a movement of goods from one State to another, not in
pursuance of the sale itself, but pursuant to an agreement to sell, which later merges into a sale,
such movement would be deemed to have been occasioned by the sale itself wherever it takes place.
(Balabhagas Hulaschand138). The subject supply contracts, which are agareements of sale, contain
stipulations obligating the petitioner contractors to supply the goods to the owner. Failure to supply
the goods, purchased by them from outside the State, to the owner whose works are being executed
within the State, would have resulted in a breach of the supply contracts. Notwithstanding that the
supply contracts are agreements to sell, the said contracts have occasioned movement of the goods
from one State to another, eventually to reach the owner. Such agreements of sale fall within the
ambit of Section 3(a) of the CST Act.
For a sale, to be held to be a Section 3(a) sale in the course of inter-State trade or commerce, the
situs of the sale is wholly irrelevant as regards its inter-State character. (Triveni Engineering &
Industries Ltd. v. State ; Onkarlal Nandlal v. State of Rajasthan ; Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd.12;
Gannon Dunkerley & Co. (II) 63). Even an inter-State sale must have a situs, and the situs may be in
one State or another. (Onkarlal Nandlal209; Gannon Dunkerley & Co. (II)63). The mere fact that
the goods have been delivered to the owner within the State does not empower the respondents to
levy tax on such inter-state sale of goods, treating them as intra-state sales under the A.P. VAT Act.
(iv) SECTION 4(7)(g) OF THE AP VAT ACT:
It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that Section 4(7)(g) was inserted in the
AP VAT Act after the decision in Larsen & Toubro Limited v. State of Andhra Pradesh
); the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, in his circular dated 23.1.2006, has held
that if there is a contractual obligation to import goods from other States, and such
movement has an inextricable link with the contract, such value should be excluded
from the scope of levy of VAT; the impugned assessment orders, raising the demand,
are contrary to the circular of the Commissioner; if the goods have moved from
outside the State, and have been used in contract, the States have no power to levy
tax; and such turnover is protected from State levy in view of the restrictions under
Article 286 of the Constitution of India read with Section 4(7)(g) of the AP VAT Act.
Section 4(7)(g) of the AP VAT Act, (as inserted by Act 5 of 2007 dated 22.01.2007 with effect from
01.09.2006), stipulates that, notwithstanding anything contained in clauses (a) to (f) of Section 4(7),
no tax shall be leviable on the turnover relating to the transfer of property in goods, whether as
goods or in some other form involved in the execution of a works contract, if such transfer from the
contractor to the contractee constituted a sale in the course of inter-State trade or commerce under
Section 3 or a sale outside the State under Section 4, or a sale in the course of import or export
under Section 5 of the CST Act.
The power of the State Legislature to enact a law to levy tax, with reference to Entry 54 of List II of
the Seventh Schedule has two limitations: the first arising out of the entry itself, and the second
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 58M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
flowing from the restriction embodied in the Constitution. The bans imposed by Articles 286 and
269, on the taxation powers of the State, are independent and separate and must be crossed before a
State Legislature can impose tax on transactions of sale or purchase of goods. (National Thermal
Power Corpn. Ltd.,136; Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd.12 Ram Narain Sons Ltd. v. Assistant
Commissioner of Sales Tax ). The power of the State Legislature, under Entry 54 in List II, remains
subject to Article 286 and Entry 92-A of List I of the VII Schedule to the Constitution whereunder
Parliament alone has the power to levy taxes on the sale of goods where such sale takes place in the
course of inter- state trade and commerce. This principle that, in cases covered by Sections 3, 4 and
5 of the CST Act, the State Legislature has no competence, to provide for the levy of sales tax, would
apply even in the case of works contracts, where an indivisible contract is made divisible by the legal
fiction introduced by legislation made pursuant to the 46th amendment to the Constitution.
(Thomson Press (I) Ltd.68; Asea Brown Boveri Ltd.184; East India Cotton Manufacturing
Company56; Gannon Dunkerly & Co. (II)63). A sale, in the course of inter-state trade or commerce
cannot be taxed by a State Legislature even if its situs is within the State, as the State Legislature
lacks legislative competence to impose a tax on such a sale, which can only be imposed by
Parliament. If, therefore, a question arises whether a sale is exigible to tax by the State Legislature,
the answer thereto is to be found by ascertaining whether or not it is a sale in the course of
inter-state trade or commerce. (Onkarlal Nandlal209).
The State Legislature cannot frame its law in a manner as to convert an outside sale or a sale in the
course of import or export into a sale inside the State. Even works contracts, assessable under the
A.P. VAT Act, are subject to Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the CST Act. As noted hereinabove Section 4 of
the CST Act, which provides when a sale or purchase is said to take place inside the State, is subject
to Section 3 of the CST Act. (Gannon Dunkerley & Co. (II)63; Larsen & Toubro152). If a sale of
goods falls within the ambit of Section 3(a) of the CST Act, the State legislature cannot subject it to
tax under the State Act. By introducing Section 4(7)(g) in the A.P.VAT Act, the State Legislature has
recognised that there can be a deemed inter-state sale under clauses (a) & (b) of Section 3, and a
deemed sale in the course of import under Section 5(2) of the CST Act involved in the execution of a
works contract. It also acknowledges that such a deemed sale, either under Section 3(a) &
(b) or under Section 5(2) of the CST Act, cannot be subjected to tax under the A.P. VAT Act.
(v) INTER-STATE WORKS CONTRACTS:
It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, the impugned orders failed to notice that
there is an inter-state movement of goods, and such movement is occasioned by the
works contract executed by the petitioner for the owner/contractee; the contracts
with the owner occasioned the inter-state movement, and delivery is effected to the
owner at the site; the petitioner has procured the goods from outside the State as a
necessary requirement under the contract, and the movement of such goods is
incidental to the deemed contract of sale; and, even if it is assumed that the actual
sale took place within the State, in view of the undisputed fact that the goods moved
from another State into the State, as a result of the contract between the parties, it is
an inter-state contract of sale; in inter-State works contracts, the theory of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 59M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
incorporation has no bearing on taxability; and after the 46th amendment to the
Constitution, even in the case of deemed sale of goods in an indivisible contract, the
value of the goods and the service turnover are to be segregated in the inter-state
movement of goods involved in the execution of a works contract, as in the case of a
normal sale.
For sustaining the levy of tax on the goods, deemed to have been sold in the execution
of a works contract, three conditions must be fulfilled: (i) there must be a works
contract, (ii) the goods should have been involved in the execution of a works
contract, and (iii) the property in those goods must be transferred to a third party
either as goods or in some other form. (Larsen and Toubro Ltd.70). Section 2(ja) of
the CST Act, (as inserted by Act No.18 of 2005 with effect from 01.04.2005), defines
works contract to mean a contract for carrying out any work which includes
assembling, construction, building, altering, manufacturing, processing etc of any
movable or immovable property. Where the main object of the work, undertaken by
the payee of the price, is not the transfer of a chattel qua chattel, the contract is one
for work and labour. (Hindustan Shipyard Ltd.147). Where the finished product
supplied to a particular customer is not a commercial commodity in the sense that it
cannot be sold in the market to any other person, the transaction is only a works
contract. (Commissioner of Sales Tax v. Prabhudayal Prem Narain ; Thomson Press
(I) Ltd.68; The Court Press Job Branch, Salem v. State of Tamil Nadu and
Commissioner of Sales Tax, MP v. Ratna Fine Arts Printing Press ). For being
classified as a works contract the transaction, under consideration, must be a
composite transaction involving both goods and services. If a transaction involves
only service, i.e. work and labour, then it cannot be treated as a works contract. (Pro
Lab.69).
The expression sale of goods in Entry 48 of List II of the VII Schedule to the
Government of India Act, 1935 had the same meaning which it had in the Sale of
Goods Act, 1930. (Banarsi Das Bhanot71). As a similar expression is used in Entry 54
of List II to the VII Schedule to the Constitution, the meaning of goods under Section
2(7) of the Sale of Goods Act was held applicable to Entry 54 as well. In Gannon
Dunkerley & Co. (I)64, the Supreme Court held that, to constitute a transaction of
sale there should be an agreement, express or implied, relating to the goods to be
completed by passing of title in those goods; both the agreement and the sale should
relate to the same subject-matter; where the goods delivered under the contract are
not the goods contracted for, the purchaser has the right to reject them, or to accept
them and claim damages for breach of warranty; there cannot be an agreement
relating to one kind of property and a sale as regards another; and, on a true
interpretation of the expression "sale of goods", there must be an agreement between
the parties for the sale of the very goods in which, eventually, the property passes.
Even after the decision of the Supreme Court in the Gannon Dunkerley (I)64, it was
possible that, where a contract consisted of two parts, namely, one part relating to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 60M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
sale of material used in the execution of the work by the contractor to the person who
had assigned the contract, and another part dealing with the supply of labour and
services, sales tax was leviable on the goods which were agreed to be sold under the
first part. But sales tax could not be levied when the contract in question was a single
and indivisible works contract. In order to overcome the effect of the decision of the
Supreme Court, in Gannon Dunkerly (I)64, Parliament, by the 46th amendment to
the Constitution, amended Article 366 by introducing sub-clause (b) of clause (29-A).
The law declared by the Supreme Court in Gannon Dunkerley-I64, wherein the
expression sale was given a restricted meaning by adopting the definition of sale in
the Sale of Goods Act, has been undone by the Forty-sixth Constitutional
Amendment so as to include works contracts. (Larsen and Toubro Ltd. v. State of
Karnataka ). The expression "sale or purchase of goods", which was an undefined
expression prior to the 46th amendment, was defined under Article 366 (29-A). The
transfer of goods, utilised by a contractor in the execution of a works contract, is
deemed to be a sale of goods in favour of the owner under the legal fiction created
under Article 366(29A)(b). (Larsen & Toubro152). After the 46th Amendment, it has
become possible for the States to levy sales tax on the value of goods involved in a
works contract in the same way in which sales tax was leviable on the price of the
goods and the material supplied in a contract which had been entered into in two
distinct and separate parts.
By use of the expression in some other form, in Article 366(29-A)(b), the ordinary
understanding of the term goods has been enlarged by bringing within its fold goods
in a form other than as goods. In other words, goods which, by incorporation, have
become a part of immovable property are deemed to be goods. The definition of tax
on the sale or purchase of goods includes a tax on the transfer of property in the
goods as goods or goods, which because of its usage in the execution of a work
contract, has lost its original form as goods, and has acquired some other form.
(Larsen and Toubro Ltd.70; Pro Lab.69; Kone Elevator India (P) Ltd.67). Article
366(29-A)(b) serves to bring transactions, where the essential ingredients of sale
defined in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 are absent, within the ambit of sale or
purchase for the purposes of levy of sales tax. In other words, transfer of movable
property in a works contract is deemed to be a sale even though it may not be a Sale
within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act. (Larson and Toubro215).
The term works contract, in Article 366(29-A)(b), encompasses a wide range and
many varieties of contracts. Once the characteristics or elements of a works contract
are satisfied in a contract then, irrespective of the additional obligations, such a
contract would be covered by the term works contract. Nothing in Article
366(29-A)(b) limits the term works contract to a contract for labour and service only,
and it is a contract for undertaking or bringing into existence some works. The
Parliament had all genre of works contract in view when clause 29-A was inserted in
Article
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 61M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
366. (Pro Lab.69; Kone Elevator India Pvt. Ltd.67; Larsen and Toubro Ltd.70). The
narrow meaning given to the term works contract in Gannon Dunkerley (1)64 now no
longer survives.
(Larsen and Toubro Ltd.215). The contracts, which are the subject matter of these Writ Petitions,
are all composite transactions involving both sale of goods and rendering of services. These
contracts were entrusted to the petitioner contractor for erection and installation of plants in
turn-key projects. As these contracts are for undertaking or bringing into existence works, they are
all works contracts.
The judgments in Usha Breco Ltd54; Larsen & Toubro Limited1; Dwaraka Prasad Radhey
Ramalal55; ECE Industries Ltd140; Sundaram Industries Limited112 and Asea Brown Boveri
Ltd.184 have all declared that the subject contracts involved an inter-state deemed sale of goods in
the execution of works contracts; and such inter-state sale of goods, which fell within the ambit of
Section 3(a) of the CST Act, could not be subject to tax under the State Act.
The object of Article 366(29-A)(b) of the Constitution is to enlarge the scope of the expression 'tax
on the sale or purchase of goods' wherever it occurs in the Constitution. The expression 'tax on the
sale or purchase of goods' in Article 286 of the Constitution, and in Entry 54 of the State List,
includes a tax on the transfer of property in goods involved in the execution of a works contract also.
(Builders Association of India186; Gannon Dunkerley (II)63; Larsen and Toubro Ltd.215). It is not
permissible for the State Legislature to make a law imposing tax on such a deemed sale which
constitutes a sale under Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the CST Act. (Gannon Dunkerley (II)63; Triveni
Engineering & Industries Ltd.208; Siemens Ltd.60). Consequently an inter-state sale of goods
which would, otherwise, have fallen within the ambit of Section 3(a) of the CST Act, cannot be
subject to tax by a law made by the State Legislature merely because the said goods have been
incorporated in the works executed within the State.
(vi) CAN THERE BE AN INTER-STATE SALE OF GOODS IN THE EXECUTION OF A WORKS
CONTRACT?
It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that a works contract, which was earlier held not to be
conventional or Nomen Juris (vide first Gannon Dunkerley64 is now deemed to be a sale; whether it
is an ordinary inter-state sale or export or import sale or a deemed inter-state sale, the
constitutional restrictions and conditions would mutatis mutandis apply to both sets of
transactions; it is not open to the State tax authorities to tax what is otherwise an inter-state sale or
an export/import sale as a local sale; Parliament conceived of an inter-State sale in the execution of
a works contract, notwithstanding the theory of accretion; the facts of the present case clinchingly
show that there is an inter-state sale under Section 3(a), and a sale in the course of import under
Section 5(2) of the CST Act; from 13.5.2002 onwards, inter-state works contracts are liable to be
taxed under the CST Act; if the goods have moved from other States, for the specific use in a works
contract for a particular contractee, transfer of property in the goods takes place in the course of
inter-state trade; if the argument of the assessing authority is accepted, there can be no inter-state
sale at all in a works contract; and this would be contrary to the intention of Parliament which has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 62M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
defined works contract in Section 2(ja) of the CST Act with effect from 01.04.2005.
Sri K. Vivek Reddy, Learned Special Counsel, would submit that, even if the goods have moved from
outside the State, since they culminate in a work, involving erection and installation, it would only
be a works contract; there cannot be a inter-state sale, under Section 3(a), in a works contract be it
divisible or indivisible; tax on works contracts is on accretion, which can take place only in a local
territory; and, therefore, the State authorities are entitled to tax the contract, as a works contract,
under the A.P. VAT Act.
In a works contract the property in the goods would, ordinarily, pass to the owner/contractee on its
incorporation in the works executed. (State of Andhra Pradesh v. Larsen & Tourbo Ltd ). It cannot
however be said that, in a works contract, the ownership of the goods must always pass by way of
accretion to the owner of the immovable property to which they are affixed. (Larsen & Toubro
Ltd.215). Taxing the sale of goods element, in a works contract, is permissible even after
incorporation of the goods, provided tax is directed to the value of the goods at the time of
incorporation, and does not purport to tax the transfer of immovable property. (Larsen & Toubro
Ltd.215).
It is no doubt true that, in Gannon Dunkerley (II)63, the Supreme Court held that the question,
whether a deemed sale results from transfer of property in goods involved under Section 3, 4 and 5
of the CST Act, has to be decided in the light of the particular terms of the works contract, and
cannot be decided in the abstract; and, as at present advised, they were not in a position to say that,
in no case, could there be a sale under Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the CST Act in respect of a deemed sale
resulting from transfer of property in goods involved in the execution of a works contract falling
within the ambit of sub-clause
(b) of Clause (29-A) of Article 366 of the Constitution.
In view of Article 366(29-A)(b) of the Constitution, a fiction can be introduced by Legislation that
the goods, involved in the execution of a works contract, have been sold. However the limitation on
the competence of the State Legislature, in respect of even a fictional sale which takes place in the
course of inter-state trade and commerce, subsists. The State Legislature is not competent to
provide for the levy of tax on such a fictional sale when it takes place in the course of inter-state
trade and commerce. (Thomson Press (I) Ltd.68; Gannon Dunkerley (II)63; Builders
Association186; East India Cotton Manufacturing Company v. The State of Haryana ). The mere fact
that the goods, which moved from one State to another, were incorporated in the works within the
States of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh does not make the deemed inter-state sale an intra-State
sale within the States of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. While it would still continue to be an
inter-state deemed sale of goods, falling within the ambit of Section 3(a) of the CST Act, its
incorporation in the works within the State is not without significance.
The charging section and the computation provisions of a taxing statute together constitute an
integrated code. (Mahim Patram Private Ltd.163; C.I.T., Bangalore etc. v. B.C. Srinivasa Setty ). The
measure or value, to which the rate of tax is applied for computing the tax liability, is one of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 63M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
components of tax. (Mahim Patram Private Ltd.163; M/s. Govind Saran Ganga Saran v.
Commissioner of Sales Tax ). While tax is imposed on the transfer of property in the goods, involved
in the execution of a works contract, the measure, for the levy of tax contemplated by Article
366(29-A)(b), is the value of the goods involved in the execution of a works contract. Since the
taxable event is the transfer of property in the goods involved in the execution of a works contract,
and the said transfer of property in such goods takes place when the goods are incorporated in the
works, the value of the goods, which would constitute the measure for the levy of the tax, has to be
the value of the goods at the time of its incorporation in the works, and not the cost of acquisition of
the goods by the contractor. (Larsen and Toubro Ltd.215; Gannon Dunkerley (II)63).
The principles laid down in the context of an intra-state deemed sale of goods involved in the
execution of a works contract would equally apply to an inter-state deemed sale of goods involved in
the execution of a works contract. As the situs of the sale is irrelevant to a sale falling within the
ambit of Section 3(a) of the CST Act, and it would suffice if the movement of goods from one State to
another is occasioned by the contract of sale or an agreement of sale containing a stipulation for the
sale of goods or even as an incidence of such contracts, the measure or value of the goods on which
tax, under Section 3(a) of the CST Act, is to be levied would be the value of the goods when it is
incorporated in the works, and neither the cost of acquisition of the goods by the contractor nor the
price at which the goods were sold by the contractor to the owner under the supply contract. The
value of the goods would also include the expenses incurred by the contractor, (after the goods have
been delivered by the carrier within the State), for transporting the goods to the site, the profit
component involved in the inter-state deemed sale of goods etc.
(vii) SHOULD THE PETITIONERS HAVE EFFECTED BRANCH TRANSFERS, INSTEAD OF AN
INTER-STATE SALE?
It is contended, on behalf of the revenue, that the supply contract did not require inter-state
movement; the test is whether it would be a breach of the contract if the seller did not procure the
goods from outside the State or country; mere inter-state movement does not result in an inter-state
sale; in the present case, the supply contract does not require inter-state movement because the
supply do not either expressly, or by necessary implication, require the goods to be obtained from
outside the State; the owner is indifferent as to whether the goods are procured locally or from
outside the State; if the Contractor procures the goods locally from the approved vendors, it would
not be a breach of the sale agreement; and delivery of the goods within the State locally, by way of a
branch transfer, is permissible and would not constitute a breach of the contract.
It is for the contracting parties to decide how, and from where, the goods should be purchased. It is
not open to the State to contend that, even if the suppliers are identified in advance, they should
have effected branch transfers, and then sold the goods to the contractee. When the goods move to a
pre-determined buyer in the destination State, then the State from which the goods commence their
journey would treat it as inter-State movement under Section 3, and levy tax without giving
exemption towards branch transfer. As noted hereinabove the goods, in the present cases, are
tailor-made for its use in the execution of the turnkey project. They are not off-the-shelf goods,
which can be sold to any other person if the owner refuses to receive them. The contracts provide
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 64M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
stringent conditions on specifications, manufacture and supply of goods. The contract entered into
between the parties is the result of an informed and conscious commercial decision agreeing on the
terms of the subject contract.
It is not for the revenue to suggest how the parties should frame the terms of their contract. All that
the assessing and revisional authorities are required to examine is whether the subject transactions,
on a reading of the contract as a whole, fall within the ambit of either Section 3(a) or Section 3(b) of
the CST Act. It is not open to them to consider whether, instead of an inter-state sale, the goods
could have been transferred by the petitioner-contractor to themselves within the state, and then
sold the goods to the owner only to enable the revenue to levy tax on such sales as intra-state sales.
Likewise there is no obligation cast on the supplier, either under the CST Act or under the contract,
to make a branch transfer, and then sell the goods to the contractor. Questions, as to how a contract
should be structured, and whether the goods should be sold in the course of inter-state trade or
commerce or brought within the state as branch transfers, are commercial decisions, for the
contracting parties to take, and not for the assessing/revisional authorities to impose.
(viii) AUTHORITY COMPETENT TO LEVY TAX ON INTER-STATE SALES UNDER SECTION 3(a)
OF THE CST ACT:
It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that the jurisdiction to levy tax, under
Section 3(a) of the CST Act, is conferred on the assessing authority of the State from
where the movement of goods commence; and, as the respondent-authorities are the
taxing authorities in the State where the goods are delivered, they lack jurisdiction to
assess the petitioners to tax under Section 3(a) of the CST Act.
As noted hereinabove, the petitioner-contractors are liable to pay tax under Section
3(a) of the CST Act on the deemed inter- state sale of goods involved in the execution
of the works contracts. The value of the goods, on which tax is liable to be paid by the
petitioners contractors, is the value of such goods at the time of its incorporation in
the works. Section 9 of the CST Act relates to levy and collection of tax and penalties
and, under sub-section (1) thereof, the tax payable by any dealer, under the CST Act,
on the sale of goods effected by him in the course of inter-State trade or commerce,
whether such sales fall within clause (a) or clause (b) of Section 3, shall be levied by
the Government of India and the tax so levied shall be collected by that Government
in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (2), in the State from which the
movement of the goods commenced. Where a question arises, in which State is the
tax under the CST Act leviable, one must look to and apply the test prescribed in
Section 9(1). No other provision is relevant on this question. (Bharat Heavy
Electricals Ltd.44). As Section 9(1) of the CST Act confers power on the assessing
authorities of the State, from where the goods commence movement, to levy tax
under Section 3(a) of the CST Act, and the respondents are the authorities of the
State where the goods have been delivered, they lack jurisdiction to levy tax on the
petitioners even under Section 3(a) of the CST Act.

V. SECTION 5(2) OF THE CST ACT
(i) HIGH-SEA SALES:
It is contended, on behalf of the petitioners, that it is the owner who secured release
of the goods from the carrier, and filed the bill of entry for the imported goods; as the
name of the owner is reflected in the bill of entry, it is evident that it is he who
imported the goods; accepting the submission of the revenue would mean that,
though the owner imported the goods, it is the contractor who continues to hold title
thereto; and such a reasoning does not explain the status under which the Owner
imported the goods.
Sri K.Vivek Reddy, Learned Special Counsel, would submit that the L & T offshore
sales do not qualify as high sea sales; a high sea sale, under Section 5(2), is like a
transit sale under Section 3(b); all the characteristics of a transit sale are also
applicable to a high sea sale; the L&T sale cannot be considered as a high sea sale as
title, for reasons stated with respect to a Section 6(2) r/w. Section 3(b) sale, does not
pass during movement; in the petitioners cases, the unconditional appropriation
happens only upon inspection and certification which happens only after the goods
have crossed the customs frontier; the conditional payment clause demonstrates that
title does not pass in the high seas; in a high sea sale, like a transit sale under Section
3(b), the contract has to come into existence during the course of movement of the
goods; in the case of L&T, there was a pre-existing contract pursuant to which the
goods had moved; the movement was under the auspices of the contract; title has
also not passed during movement; the submission made with respect to Section 3(b)
are applicable to a high sea sale also; a person can be an importer even without being
the owner of the goods; and Section 2(26) of the Customs Act makes it clear that even
a person, holding himself out to be an importer, can also be an importer.
Section 5, in Chapter II of the CST Act, stipulates when a sale or purchase of goods is
said to take place in the course of import or export and, under sub-section (2)
thereof, a sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed to take place in the course of the
import of the goods into the territory of India only if the sale or purchase either
occasions such import or is effected by a transfer of documents of title to the goods
before the goods have crossed the customs frontiers of India. Section 2(ab) of the CST
Act defines the expression crossing the customs frontiers of India to mean crossing
the limits of the area of a customs station in which imported goods are ordinarily
kept before clearance by the customs authorities. Under the Explanation thereto, for
the purpose of clause (ab) of Section 2, the words customs station and customs
authorities shall have the same meaning as in the Customs Act, 1962.
In Union of India v. Sampat Raj Dugar , the Supreme Court held that, if the definition
of `importer' in Section 2(26) of the Customs Act were kept aside, a person who did
not pay for, and receive the documents of title, did not become the owner of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 66M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
goods; the definition of `importer', in Section 2(26) of the Customs Act, was not
relevant to the question of title; it only defined the expression `importer'; the idea is
to hold the licensee responsible for anything and everything that happens from the
time of import till they are cleared through Customs, whether or not he is the owner
of such goods in law; ownership of the imported goods cannot be attributed to the
importer even in a case where he abandons them, i.e. in a situation where he does not
pay for and receive the documents of title; holding otherwise would place the
exporter in a very difficult position; he would loose the goods without receiving
payment, and his only remedy would be to sue the importer for the price of goods,
and for such damage as he may have suffered; and this would not be conducive to
international trade.
Unless the goods, brought into the country for the purpose of use, enjoyment,
consumption, sale or distribution, are incorporated in and get mixed up with the
totality of the property in the country, they cannot be said to have been imported.
(Shri Ramlinga Mills Pvt. Ltd. v. Assistant Collector of Customs ; The Central India
Spinning and Weaving and Manufacturing Co., Ltd, The Empress Mills, Nagpur v.
The Municipal Committee, Wardha ; K.R. Ahmed Shah v. Additional Collector of
Customs, Madras ). The importer of the goods is, therefore, the person who brings
into India the goods from a place outside. The course of import of goods starts at a
point when the goods cross the customs barrier of the foreign country and ends at a
point in the importing country after the goods cross its customs barriers. The sale
which occasions the import is a sale in the course of import. A purchase by an
importer of goods, when they are on the high seas by payment against shipping
documents, is also a purchase in the course of import. A sale by an importer of goods,
after the property in the goods has passed to him either after receipt of the
documents of title against payment or otherwise, to a third party by a similar process
is also a sale in the course of import. (J.B. Trading Corporation v. Union of India ).
An importer is, ordinarily, the person who brings into India goods from any place
outside India. In view of the expanded definition of importer in Section 2(26) of the
Customs Act while any person, who imports goods from a foreign country into India,
would undoubtedly be an importer, the owner of the goods and a person holding
himself out be an importer would also be an importer, however only during the
period between the importation of the goods and the time they are cleared for home
consumption, and not prior thereto or thereafter. That limb of the definition of
importer, in Section 2(26) of the Customs Act, is designed to protect the interests of
the owner or the exporter where the goods have not been claimed or redeemed by the
designated importer in India. The definition cannot be used to usurp the identity of
an importer from the person who filed the bill of entry. As Section 2(26) is an
inclusive definition, the person in whose name the bill of entry is filed does not cease
to be the importer. In other words, the person who has secured the release of the
goods from the carrier, who has filed the bill of entry, and who has undertaken the
work of clearance, continues to be an importer. (M/s. Vellanki Frame Works,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 67M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
Visakhapatnam v. The Commercial Tax Officer, Chinawaltair Circle, Visakhapatnam
). If the name of the Owner is reflected in the bill of entry as the importer of the
goods, it would be difficult to accept the submission of the revenue that,
notwithstanding the Owner being the importer of the goods, the title to the goods
continued to remain with the contractor. The person, whose name is reflected in the
bill of entry, is assessed to customs duty under the Customs Act. While the importer
of the goods can also be an agent of the owner of the goods such a presumption, in
the present batch of Writ Petitions, would be incongruous as that would mean that
the person, shown as the importer of the goods in the bill of entry, has acted as the
agent of the contractor in importing the goods only for the contractor to sell the
goods to him later.
While the submission, urged on behalf of the revenue, that an import sale, falling
within the second limb of Section 5(2) of the CST Act, has the characteristics of a
Section 3(b) sale has considerable force, Section 5(2) must be read in conjunction
with, and its scope examined in the light of, the provisions of the Customs Act. This
requirement of an import sale, falling within the ambit of the second limb of Section
5(2), being read in conjunction with the provisions of the Customs Act would place it
on a slightly different footing from Section 3(b) of the CST Act. The transfer of title to
the goods on high seas is, ordinarily, by endorsement on the bill of lading. A bill of
lading is the symbol of the goods, and the right to possess those passes to the
transferee of the bill of lading. Its transfer is symbolic of the transfer of the goods
themselves and, until the goods have been delivered, the delivery of the duly
endorsed bill of lading operates as between the transferor or transferee, and all who
claim through them, as a physical delivery of the goods would do. The bill of lading
also carries with it the rights and liabilities under the contract, where the property in
the goods also is transferred. The property in the cargo passes to the consignee or the
endorsee of the bill of lading, but the contract, whereunder the consignment or
endorsement is made, has always to be taken into consideration. The consignee or an
endorsee gets only such rights as its consignor or endorser had in respect of the goods
mentioned in the bill of lading. (British India Steam Navigation Co. Ltd.59).
An endorsement on the bill of lading in favour of the owner, in relation to the
imported goods, before the goods have crossed the customers frontiers, prima facie,
shows that it is the Owner who is the importer of the goods, and not the
petitioner-contractor. If the bill of entry has also been filed by the Owner that would
also indicate that the goods have been imported by the Owner. It would be
inappropriate for us to examine, in certiorari proceedings, whether it is the
contractor or the owner who secured release of the goods from the carrier, and
whether the bill of entry for import of the goods was filed by the contractor or the
owner. On remand the authorities, who passed the impugned orders, shall examine
these aspects in the light of the observations made hereinabove. It is unnecessary for
us to delve on this aspect any further as the respondents cannot subject the
petitioners to tax, under the A.P. VAT Act, even if the import of the goods, under the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 68M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
subject contracts, fall within the ambit of the first limb of Section 5(2) of the CST Act.
That some of the petitioners have contended that these are high sea sales, falling
within the ambit of the second limb of Section 5(2) of the CST Act, would not disable
them from contending that the subject imports fall within the first limb of Section
5(2) as, in either event of an import falling within the first or the second limb of
Section 5(2) of the CST Act, the respondents lack jurisdiction to levy tax on such sales
under the provisions of the A.P. VAT Act.
(ii) SALES WHICH OCCASION IMPORT:
It is contended by Sri S.Ravi, Learned Senior Counsel, that some of the goods for the
turnkey project were imported by Alstrom Projects from Indonesia under Chapter 98
of the Customs Tariff Act after the owner had obtained prior approval from the
Government of Andhra Pradesh; the State Government gave a letter to the
Commissioner of Customs, Kakinada to allow import under the Project Import
Regulations; the order was placed by the Petitioner on the Foreign Supplier; the
goods were dispatched after inspection and approval by the owner; the order and the
bill of lading refer only to the owner; the bills of entry were filed by the petitioners
and the goods were cleared on account of the owner; the goods were cleared from
Customs by paying concessional rate of duty, as goods imported for a power project;
the Commissioner of Customs had certified that the goods had been cleared from
Customs by the petitioner through Bills of Entry dated 16.3.2005 and 1.6.2005
respectively under Project Import Regulations, and had been installed in the factory
premises of the owner; the supply contract with the owner required the petitioner to
provide such equipment which were to be imported from abroad; an order was placed
on Alstom Power Energy System, Indonesia; the consignment was, thereafter,
shipped to India; the petitioner submitted an undertaking to the custom authorities
stating that the imported equipment would be used only for the power project of the
owner; thereafter, installation certificates were issued by the Custom authorities; the
petitioners claim was under the first limb of Section 5(2); the petitioner could not
have offered the imported equipment to anyone else without committing a breach of
the supply contract with the owner; this unconditional passing of title was also
reflected in the bills of lading; the imported equipment were designed and
engineered to meet the specifications, and the requirement of the power project; they
were sold in the course of import; the title to the imported equipment passed outside
the customs frontiers of India; the first limb of Section 5(2) of the CST Act was
satisfied; the sale, by the petitioner to the owner, was the direct and proximate cause
of the import of the subject equipment; the contract with the owner occasioned the
import of goods from a foreign country; the documents filed by the petitioner
clinchingly establish that the goods had moved from a foreign country for the specific
use in the works contract with the owner; the Commissioner of Customs certified that
they were installed in the Project of GPL; and, absence of a similar provision, for
import of goods like Section 5(3), would not set at naught the decisions of the
Supreme Court, particularly in Indure Limited75.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 69M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
Sri K. Vivek Reddy, Learned Special Counsel, would submit that inconsistent and
mutually destructive pleas have been taken; an import sale, under Section 5(2), can
only happen in two ways;
(i) the sale or purchase occasions import; (ii) the sale is effected by transfer of
documents of title to the goods before the goods have crossed the customs frontier of
India i.e. high sea sale; [c] like a Section 3(a) and a Section 3(b) sale, there are two
mutually exclusive categories under Section 5(2), and one cannot fall within the
other; the import sale should either be a high sea sale or a sale occasioning import; in
a high sea sale, the transfer of title to the goods must have happened before the goods
have crossed the customs frontier of India; there is no high sea sale as the supply
contracts clearly show that title has passed only in India; the Project Import
Regulations require the employers name to be mentioned in the import documents so
as to ensure that the goods are actually being used for the specified power project;
neither the said Regulations, nor the documents, demonstrate that the owner
becomes the importer; Alstoms claim that it is a sale occasioning import, under
Section 5(2), is not tenable because the agreement is only an agreement to sell and
not a sale, the goods are future goods and not specific goods, the movement of goods
is not pursuant to the supply contract between Alstom India and the owner, but
rather the movement was pursuant to the contract between the foreign supplier
(Alstom Indonesia) and the petitioner (Alstom India); and there is no privity of
contract between the foreign supplier (Alstom Indonesia) and the owner.
The sale which occasions import, under the first limb of Section 5(2), is a sale which occasions the
import of goods from a foreign country into India. The movement of goods from the foreign country
into India must have been occasioned by the sale or must be as an incident of such sale. The import
of the goods and the sale must be inextricably connected, and the movement of goods from the
foreign country into India must be otherwise inexplicable. The expression "occasions the movement
of goods", occurring in Section 3(a) and Section 5(2) of the CST Act has the same meaning. (S. R.
Sarkar106; K.G. Khosla (I)177). Likewise the expression "sale occasions import", in Section 5(2) of
the CST Act, has to be given the same meaning which the expression "occasions the movement of
goods" in Section 3(a) has received. (Embee Corporation149). In order that the sale should be one in
the course of import it must occasion the import, and to occasion the import there must be integral
connection or inextricable link between the first sale following the import and the actual import
provided by an obligation to import arising from statute, contract or mutual understanding or
nature of the transaction which links the sale to import which cannot, without committing a breach
of statute or contract or mutual understanding, be snapped. (Deputy Commissioner of Agricultural
Income Tax & Sales Tax v. Indian Explosives Ltd ).
Let us now examine the judgments cited by Learned Counsel on either side on the scope of Section 5
of the CST Act. In K.G. Khosla177 the Supreme Court held that it was clear from the contract that the
movement of axle-box bodies from Belgium to Madras was incidental to the contract that the
axle-box bodies would be manufactured in Belgium, inspected there and imported into India for the
consignee; movement of the goods from Belgium to India was in pursuance of the contract between

the assessee and the Director-General of Supplies; there was no possibility of these goods being
diverted by the assessee for any other purpose; and, consequently, the sale took place in the course
of import of goods within Section 5(2) of the Act and were, therefore, exempt from taxation. In
answer to the contention, that the decision of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in K.G.
Khosla (I)177 had not been correctly decided and should be referred to a larger Bench, the Supreme
Court, in Indure75, opined that K.G. Khosla (I)177 had held the field for more than three decades;
and its correctness has not been doubted so far.
In Coffee Board (I)175, the Supreme Court held that three essentials are required to be met before
the sale can be said to be in the course of import, (i) there must be a sale; (ii) the goods must actually
be imported; and (iii) the sale must be a part and parcel of the import; if there are two independent
sales, the link between the imported goods and their actual delivery to their actual users would be
broken; and the integrated course of import would then be found wanting. In Binani Bros. (P)
Ltd.176, the Supreme Court held that the movement of goods was occasioned by the contracts for
purchase which the petitioner entered into with the foreign sellers; no movement of goods, in the
course of import, took place pursuant to the contracts of sale made by the petitioner with the
DGS&D; the petitioners sales to DGS&D were distinct and separate from his purchases from foreign
sellers; the sales, by the petitioner to the DGS&D, did not occasion the import; it was the purchases,
made by the petitioner from the foreign sellers, which occasioned the import of the goods; the
purchase of the goods, and import of the goods pursuant to the contract of purchases were, no
doubt, for sale to the DGS&D; it did not follow that the sale or contracts of sale to DGS&D
occasioned the movement of the goods into this country; there was no privity of contract between
DGS&D and the foreign sellers; the foreign sellers did not enter into any contract by themselves or
through the agency of the petitioner to the DGS&D; the movement of goods from the foreign
countries was not occasioned on account of sales by the petitioner to DGS & D; and therefore, even if
the contracts envisaged the import of goods and their supply to the DGS&D from out of the goods
imported, it did not follow that the movement of the goods in the course of import was occasioned
by the contracts of sale by the petitioner with DGS & D. In Mohd. Serajuddin174 the Supreme Court
held that the expression in the course in Section 5 implied not only a period of time during which
the movement was in progress, but postulated a connected relation; and sale in the course of export
out of the territory of India meant sale taking place not only during the activities directed to the end
of exportation of the goods out of the country but also as part of, or connected with, such activities.
It is to remove the basis of the judgment, in Mohd. Serajuddin174, that Parliament introduced
sub-section (3) into Section 5 of the CST Act. While upholding the validity of Section 5(3) of the CST
Act the Supreme Court, in Coffee Board207 held that Section 5(3) of the CST Act has been enacted
to extend the exemption, from tax liability under the Act, not to any kind of penultimate sale but
only to such a penultimate sale as satisfies the two conditions specified therein, namely, (a) that
such penultimate sale must take place (i.e. become complete) after the agreement or order under
which the goods are to be exported and (b) it must be for the purpose of complying with such
agreement or order; and it is only then that such penultimate sale is deemed to be a sale in the
course of export.
In Indian Explosives Ltd.226, the Supreme Court held that Binani Bros.176 was clearly
distinguishable on two material aspects; in that case the assessee itself held the import licence and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 71M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
the goods were imported on the strength of such import licence, and not on the strength of any
actual users licence; secondly, there was no term or condition prohibiting diversion of the goods
after the import; it is these two factors which establish the integral connection or inextricable link
between the transactions of sale and the actual import making the sales in the course of import; and,
if the movement of the goods from the foreign country to India was in pursuance of the
requirements flowing from the contract of sale between the - assessee and the local purchaser, the
sale in question must be held to be in the course of import.
In K. Gopinathan Nair179 the Supreme Court held that any purchase of goods imported by a
canalising agency, which is the importer of such goods and which sells them to the actual users,
would also partake the character of a sale between principal and principal wherein the foreign seller
would be out of the picture; such transactions cannot be termed as a well-knit integrated transaction
between all the three of them so as to make the transaction one of sale or purchase in the course of
import; it may be a transaction because of or by the import carried out by the canalising agency; the
decision in Coffee Board (II)207 is confined to the validity of the amended Section 5(3); for
interpreting the identical phraseology in the course of, found both in Section 5(1) and Section 5(2),
the decision in Coffee Board (II)207 would naturally not be of any assistance, as obviously the three
learned Judges Bench could not have laid down anything contrary to what the Constitution Benches
in Mohd. Serajuddin174 and Binani Bros.176 had laid down on a true construction of the provisions
of Sections 5(1) and 5(2); it is only because of the amendment in Section 5(3) that, by legislative
fiction, even the penultimate sales were sought to be covered by the said phrase; and no amendment
has been introduced by the legislature for extending the sweep of the phrase sale in the course of
import.
On the contention of the respondents that the case was covered by the decisions of the Supreme
Court in Binani Bros. 176; Mohd. Serajuddin174; and K. Gopinathan Nair179, the Supreme Court, in
Indure75, held that the decision in Binani Bros.176 was distinguishable as, in that case, no
obligation was imposed on the appellant to supply the imported goods to DGS&D after they had
been imported, and the same could be directed to other channels; similarly the decision in Mohd.
Serajuddin174 was not applicable as, in that case, it was found that the appellant therein had sold
the goods directly to the Corporation which entered into a contract with a foreign buyer, and the
immediate cause of export was the contract between the foreign buyer who was the importer, and
the Corporation which was the exporter; this decision rested on the peculiar facts of that case, and
no assistance could be derived from the said decision; in K. Gopinathan Nair179, on facts, it was
found that, on account of the sale to CCI by the foreign exporters, raw cashew nuts were imported
into India - the importer being the CCI, and not the local user; and the Supreme Court had held that
the principles evolved by it, in para 12 of the judgment, were not applicable to that case.
This Court is bound by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Indure75, and the submission of
Sri K. Vivek Reddy, Learned Special Counsel, that, notwithstanding the aforesaid observations in
Indure75, the earlier judgments of the Supreme Court in Binani Bros.176; Mohd Serajuddin174 and
K. Gopinathan Nair179 should be followed, necessitates rejection. Sri K. Vivek Reddy, Learned
Special Counsel, would submit that, as Parliament introduced Section 5(3) to overcome the basis of
the judgment of the Supreme Court in Mohd. Serajuddin174 construing the scope of Section 5(1),
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 72M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
the law declared by the Supreme Court, in Mohd. Serajuddin174, would continue to govern the
scope of Section 5(2). This submission is based on certain observations in the judgment of the
Supreme Court in K. Gopinathan Nair179. As the Supreme Court in Indure75 noticed its earlier
judgments, including K. Gopinathan Nair179, and followed K.G. Khosla (I)177, this Court is bound
by the law declared by the Supreme Court in Indure75 and K.G. Khosla (I) 177.
The contract, which was under examination in Indure75, is similar to the contracts under
consideration in the present batch of writ petitions. It is useful, therefore, to note the contentions
raised by the revenue, and the law laid down by the Supreme Court, therein. The respondents
contended before the Supreme Court that the appellants obligation was that the materials, used in
the execution of the subject contract, should conform to the specification stipulated by N.T.P.C; the
appellant had imported the goods on its own accord, and under a special licensing scheme which
enabled it to import raw materials and components for manufacture in India; the declarations made
by the appellant, to the Licensing Authority, required them not to 'trade' in the imported goods, and
they undertook to re-export them after further manufacture and value addition of atleast 33 percent;
sale to N.T.P.C, by the appellant, was not of the goods which were imported by them; the Special
Import License granted to the appellant entitled them to divert the goods; the imports were neither
pursuant to any stipulation in the contract nor as an incidence thereof; the imports did not occasion
the sale; they were only acting on behalf of the ultimate purchaser for whom the work was being
executed; the goods, which were imported by the appellant, was for their own purposes, though
ultimately to be utilised for the N.T.P.C Ash Handling Plant; even when the imported goods were
dispatched to the site office of the appellant at N.T.P.C Farakka, the appellant had submitted a
declaration undertaking to duly account, to the sales-tax authorities, the disposal of the said goods,
and to pay tax on such sales in accordance with the provisions of the State Act; the appellant had
admitted that the raw material imported by it were manufactured by it; to secure the value addition
of at least 33 percent, such raw material could not remain the same after being processed into the
final product; and, as the matter had been dealt with and considered from all angles, no case for
interference by the Supreme Court had been made out.
Rejecting the aforesaid contentions of the revenue the Supreme Court, in Indure75, held that, while
interpreting the expression sale occasions import occurring in Section 5(2) of the Act, it was not
necessary that a completed sale should precede the import; in order that the sale should be one in
the course of import it must occasion the import; in order to occasion the import there must be an
integral connection or an inextricable link between the first sale following the import, and the actual
import provided by an obligation to import arising from the statute, contract or mutual
understanding or the nature of the transaction which links the sale to import which cannot, without
committing a breach of the statute or contract or mutual understanding, be snapped; the appellant
had, admittedly, imported the goods into India for completion of the Project, on a turnkey basis, for
the NTPC; it was not the respondents case that the pipes so imported were not necessary
components for the erection and commissioning of the plant; admittedly, the said pipes were used
as components in the ash handling plant in the same condition as they were imported without
altering its originality; such an import would fall within the constitutional umbrella; the appellant
had, admittedly, imported the goods into India for completion of the Project of NTPC on a turnkey
basis; and thus, by virtue of Article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution, it would not be taxable.

In the contracts, which are the subject matter of the writ petitions before us, the imported goods
were designed and engineered to meet the specifications of the plant which was being erected and
installed by the petitioner-contractors for the owner; sale of the goods by the petitioners-
contractors to the owner was the direct and proximate cause of the import; it is not even the case of
the revenue that the imported goods were diverted by the petitioners, and were not utilised for the
works contract executed for the owner; there is an inextricable link, which is other wise inexplicable,
between the import of the goods/equipment by the petitioner-contractor, and the sale of the
imported goods to the owner; and, in the light of the judgment of the Supreme Court in Indure
Ltd75, the sale of imported goods by the petitioners contractors to the owner would fall within the
ambit of the first limb of Section 5(2) of the CST Act, and the respondents lack jurisdiction to subject
such import sales to tax under the A.P. VAT Act.
VI. CONCLUSION:
While the submissions, urged on behalf of the petitioners, that the supply and
erection contracts are divisible and independent contracts, and they are entitled to
claim exemption under Section 6(2) of the CST Act, necessitate rejection, their
contention that the subject sales/deemed sales fall within the ambit of Section 3(a)
and 5(2) of the CST Act must be upheld. As the provisions of each contract differ
from the other and, even for one assessment period, the petitioners have entered into
more than one contract, we have refrained from burdening this already lengthy
judgment with a reference to the relevant clauses in each individual contract. We
consider it appropriate, instead, to set aside the assessment/revisional orders to the
limited extent the turnover, relating to inter-state sales and import sales under
Sections 3 and 5 of the CST Act, have been subjected to tax under the AP VAT Act.
The assessing/revisional authorities shall, in the light of the observations made
hereinabove, pass orders afresh and in accordance with law, after affording the
petitioners an opportunity of a personal hearing.
It is only on account of the pendency of these Writ Petitions before this Court that the
petitioners were disabled from preferring appeals, against the impugned orders, in so
far as the other issues which arise for consideration therein are concerned. There is
no provision either under the A.P. VAT Act or under the Writ Proceedings Rules
which enable the petitioners to simultaneously invoke the jurisdiction of the High
Court and the statutory appellate authorities against the very same
assessment/revisional orders, albeit on different grounds. That would, however, not
justify this Court taking upon itself the task of examining all the issues, which arise
for consideration from the impugned orders, merely because the Writ Petitions were
entertained on the plea that a part of the assessment/revisional orders suffered from
a jurisdictional error. All the Learned Senior Counsel, and the Learned Counsel,
appearing on behalf of the petitioners would submit that, since the petitioners have
confined their submissions only with reference to Sections 3 to 6 of the CST Act, and
the Writ Petitions were admitted only on this score, they should be permitted to
contest all other issues by way of statutory appeals under the AP VAT Act. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/151154317/ 74M/S.Larsen And Toubro Ltd vs 1. State Of Andhra Pradesh Rep. By Its ... on 14 September, 2015
Learned Advocate General for the State of Telangana, Sri K. Vivek Reddy, Learned
Special Counsel and Sri S. Suribabu, Learned Special Standing Counsel for
Commercial Taxes, would fairly state that, in case the petitioners were to avail the
remedy of an appeal to the appellate authority/STAT within four weeks from today,
the respondents would not object to the appeals being entertained and decided on
merits, notwithstanding that the time stipulated under the Act, for preferring
appeals, has expired long ago.
It is wholly unnecessary for us to examine the assessment/ revisional orders, with
regards imposition of tax on various other items, as this Court made it clear, even
when the hearing of these Writ Petitions commenced, that it would confine its
examination to the contentions raised, in this batch of Writ Petitions, only regarding
levy of tax, under the A.P. VAT Act, on the sale of goods which the petitioners claimed
were transit sales, inter-state sales, high sea sales and import sales; and whether they
could be subjected to tax, by the respondents, treating them as intra-state sales
taxable under the A.P. VAT Act.
In Zunaid Enterprises47, the Supreme Court permitted the assessees, in the
appeals/applications filed before it, to file appropriate appeals/revisions before the
appellate/revisional authorities within a month; and directed that, if such
appeals/revisions were filed within the time granted, the appellate /revisional
authorities should dispose of the appeals/revisions on merits, without reference to
the period of limitation. We are satisfied that ends of justice would require the
exercise of our extra-ordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India, (which, in L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India , has been held to be a part of
the basic structure of the Constitution of India), to direct the appellate
authorities/STAT, in case appeals are filed by the petitioners herein within four
weeks from today, to entertain them despite expiry of the period of limitation for
filing appeals under the Act. All the Writ Petitions are disposed of accordingly. The
miscellaneous petitions pending, if any, shall also stand disposed of. No costs.
