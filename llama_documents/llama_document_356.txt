ORDER N.D. Patnaik, J.
1. An important question of law arises for consideration in this revision petition i.e., whether the
jurisdiction under the Consumer Protection Act can be invoiced in the matter of granting leases by
the Government under the Mines and Minerals Act and the Rules made thereunder.
2. The brief facts which are relevant are as follows:-The 1st respondent i.e. Taraka Rama Labour
Contract Co-operative Society has filed an application dated 2/-2-1989 before the Deputy Director
of Mines and Geology, Warangal for grant of lease for quarrying in an extent of ac. 2.00 in
Ramanaiahgutta covered by S.No. 64 of Burhampur village in Khammam district. The Deputy
Director by his order dated 23-4-1989 granted the lease of the land but directed the 1st respondent
society to execute lease in the prescribed form within a period of 90 days. It is stated that one day
prior to the last day for executing the lease the 1st respondent filed the papers in the office of the
Assistant Director of Mines and Geology but the lease was not executed. Meanwhile on an
application dated 30-5-1989 filed by the 3rd respondent i.e. Laxmi Vaddera Labour Contract
Co-operative Society requesting for granting of lease of the land the Deputy Director passed another
order dated 20-7-1989 modifying the earlier order granting the lease of ac. 2.00 in favour of
Tarakarama Labour Contract society and granting lease of ac. 1.00 each to the two societies i.e.
respondents 1 and 3. The 1st respondent society filed a consumer dispute under the Consumer
Protection Act before the District Consumer Forum at Khammam (CD.No. 62/1989) and also filed
an application C.D.M.P. 5/89 under Section 12 (b) of the Consumer Protection ac. to issue interim
direction to the Assistant Director of Mines and Geology, Khammam to execute lease agreement in
accordance with the order dated 23-4-1989 passed by the Deputy Director of Mines and Geology,
Warangal granting lease of ac. 2.00. The District Consumer Forum by its order dated 5th August,
1989 issued ex-parte interim dilution to the Assistant Director of Mines and Geology, Khammam to
execute the lease agreement. Aggrieved by that the Assistant Director, Mines and Geology filed this
revision petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
3 The main contention of the learned Government Pleader appearing for the petitioner is that the
grant of the mining lease of the Government lands is covered by the Mines and Minerals Act and the
Rules made thereunder i.e. the A.P. Minor Mineral Concession Rules and that the Consumer
Protection Act is not at all applicable to the gram of such leases.
4. The Consumer Protection Act of 1986, as its preamble reads, is an Act to provide for better
protection of the interests of consumers and for that purpose to make provision for the
establishment of consumer councils and other authorities for the settlement of consumers disputes
and for matters connected therewith. Section 2 (d) of the Act defines the "consumer" as any person
who-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1570109/ 1Asst. Director Of Mines And ... vs Tarakarama Labour Contract ... on 5 October, 1990
(i) buys any goods for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly
promised, or under any system of deferred payment and includes any user of such goods other than
the person who buys such goods for consideration paid or promised or partly paid or partly
promised, or under any system of deferred payment when such use is made with the approval of
such person, but does not include a person who obtains such goods for resale or for any commercial
purpose; or
(ii) hires any services for a consideration which has been paid or promised or partly paid and partly
promised or under any system of deferred payment and includes any beneficiary of such services
other than the person who hires the services for consideration paid or promised, or partly paid and
partly promised or under any system of deferred payment, when such services are availed of with
the approval of the first mentioned person;"
"Trader" means a person who sells or distributes any goods for sale and includes the manufacturer
thereof, and where such goods are sold or distributed in package form, includes the packer thereof,
(vide Section 2 (q). 'Service' is defined in Clause (o) of Section 2 as service of any description which
is made available to potential users and includes the provision of facilities in connection with
banking, financing, insurance, transport, processing, supply of electrical or other energy, board or
lodging or both, entertainment, amusement or the purveying news' or other information, but does
not include the rendering of any service free of charge or under a contract of personal service".
Section 11 of the Act provides that subject to the other provisions of the Act, the District Forum shall
have jurisdiction to entertain complaints where the value of the goods or services and the
compensation, if any, claimed is less than rupees one lakh. Section 12 says that a complaint, in
relation to any goods sold or delivered or any service provided, may be filed with a District Forum by
the persons named thereunder. Section 13 prescribes the procedure on receipt of complaint. It is
therefore contended by the learned Government Pleader for the petitioner that the 1st respondent is
not a consumer, the petitioner is not a trader and no service is provided by the Government while
granting lease under the Mineral Concession Rules. He has pointed out that according to the
definition of service some Government departments or undertakings may be included within the
purview of the Consumer Protection Act for example Railways, Postal and Tele-communications,
running bus services, supply of electricity or water or similar departments which render services to
the consumer by collecting charges therefor. But granting the leases under the statutory rules ie., the
Mineral Concession Rules cannot be construed as rendering service within the meaning of the
Consumer Protection Act. The jurisdiction under the Act relates to disputes regarding the goods sold
or services provided as could be seen from Sections 11 and 12 of the Act. In this case obviously there
is no sale of goods. I also agree with the contention of the learned Government Pleader appearing for
the petitioner that no service is rendered by the petitioner or the Government while granting the
mining lease and therefore the provisions of Consumer Protection Act cannot be invoked for
granting mining leases.
5. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent has referred to certain decisions given by the
Consumer Disputes Commissions of Rajasthan, New Delhi and also the National Consumer
Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi. They all relate to disputes regarding insurance
companies, telecommunications. Railways and Banks. These are all governed by the definition of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1570109/ 2Asst. Director Of Mines And ... vs Tarakarama Labour Contract ... on 5 October, 1990
'service'. He has also referred to an article in the Hindu dated 12th November, 1989 regarding the
Consumer Movement and the remedy provided by the Consumer Protection Act for speedy redressal
of the complaints. It is no doubt true that the Consumer Protection Act which has been enacted for
the protection and interests of the consumers has to be liberally construed so that it may serve the
purpose for which it is enacted i.e., to protect the interests of the consumers. But, it can be availed of
by only persons who are consumers as denned in the said Act i.e., those who buy any goods or those
who engage any services i.e., there must be a sale of goods or rendering service. In this case the lease
is granted by the Deputy Director under the A.P. Mineral Concession Rules of 1966 which are the
statutory rules framed by the State Government in exercise of the powers conferred by Sub-section
(1) of Section 15 of the Mines and Minerals (Regulations and Development) Act, 1975. (Sic. 1957)
Those rules provide for grant of lease, the conditions of lease, etc. The application is made by the 1st
respondent for grant of lease under the said rules to the concerned authorities. If the 1st respondent
is aggrieved by the subsequent order passed by the Deputy Director modifying the original order, he
can file an appeal as provided under Rule 35 of the said rules. But in this case there is no sale of
goods or service to be rendered. So, the 1st respondent does not come within the definition of the
consumer under the Consumer Protection Act. Therefore, I agree with the contention that the 1st
respondent cannot invoke the jurisdiction under the Consumer Protection Act to direct the
petitioner to execute the lease deed.
6. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent i.e., Tarakarama Co-op. Society has contended that if
the petitioner i.e., the respondent before the Consumer Forum of Khammam wants to question the
jurisdiction of that forum he should take objection before that forum. He has also pointed out that if
the petitioner is aggrieved by any order passed by the District Consumer Forum he can file appeal
before the State Commission under Section 15 of the Act but cannot file this revision in the High
Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
7. Since the interim order was an ex-parte order there was no opportunity for the petitioner to
question the jurisdiction of the consumer forum to entertain the matter. Subsequently the petitioner
has filed a counter in the main case i.e. CD. 62/1989 in which he has contended that the Consumer
Protection Act is not applicable to the case and that the matter is still pending.
8. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent has argued that under Section 15 of the Consumer
Protection Act any person aggrieved by an order made by the District Forum may prefer an appeal
against such order to the State Commission and so the petitioner should have filed an appeal before
the State Commission against the orders of the District Forum.
9. I will consider the decision cited by the counsel on either side regarding the exercise of
jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
10. In U. P. State v. Mohd. Nooh, AIR 1958 S.C. 86 supra it is pointed out that "If an inferior court or
tribunal of first instance acts wholly without jurisdiction or patently in excess of jurisdiction or
manifestly conducts the proceedings before it in a manner which is contrary to the rules of natural
justice and all accepted rules of procedure and which offends the superior court's sense of fair play
the superior court may. quite properly exercise its power to issue the prerogative writ of Certiorari to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1570109/ 3Asst. Director Of Mines And ... vs Tarakarama Labour Contract ... on 5 October, 1990
correct the error of the court or tribunal of first instance, even if an appeal to another inferior court
or tribunal was available and recourse was not had to it or if recourse was had to it, it confirmed
what ex facie was a nullity for reasons aforementioned. This would be so all the more if the tribunals
holding the original trial and the tribunals hearing the appeal or revision were merely departmental
tribunals composed of persons belonging to the departmental hierarchy without adequate legal
training and background and whose glaring lapses occasionally come to the notice of the Supreme
Court."
11. In Mohd. Yunus v. Mohd Mustaqom, it was held that the "Supervisory jurisdiction conferred on
the High Courts under Article 227 of the Constitution is limited 'to seeing that an inferior court or
Tribunal functions within the limits of its authority' and not to correct an error apparent on the face
of the record, much less an error of law". In that case it was held that an appeal lay form an order
passed under Order 21 Rule 90 C.P.C. and further questions raised fell with in Section 47 C.P.C. and
were appealable. At least a revision lay to High Court against the order and hence the High Court
had no jurisdiction to interfere with the order of Subordinate Judge under Article 227 of the
Constitution.
12. The learned counsel for the 1st respondent had referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in
Nilakanth Prasad v. State of Bihar's, . In that case it was pointed out that when a scheme has been
notified and a route had already been granted to the State Transporting undertaking the Regional
Transport Authority was incompetent to renew a permit in favour of private operators over a route
embracing the said route. Where it renewed such permits it failed to do its duty under law and the
Appeal Board was entitled, when the record was before it to revise the order of the Regional
Authority, even in cases where the appeal was incompetent. It was pointed out in such a case neither
the High Court nor the Supreme Court would interfere in its discretionary powers under Articles
226 and 227 with the order of the Appeal Board setting aside the renewal of such permits because
even if the appeal for some reason was incompetent, the Appeal Board had the record before it and
gave effect to the incorrect legal position arising from a notified scheme.
13. In Maneck Custodui v. Sar af azali, it was pointed out that the respondent had dearly a legal
remedy available to him by way of an appeal against the decree of the City Civil Court and that
remedy was not only adequate but was more comprehensive than the one under Article 227 of the
Constitution. It is true that despite the existence of an alternate legal remedy the High Court may
interfere in favour of an applicant under Article 226 of the Constitution but this was certainly not
one of such extraordinary cases. It was not proper for the High Court to entertain an application
under Article 227 against a decree passed by a subordinate Court when the procedural law allows an
appeal against it and that appeal lay to the High Court itself."
14. A division bench of the Bombay High Court has stated in Kassam Ibrahim v. M.M. Chudasama,
that if the law provides adequate legal remedy, which remedy is as efficacious as the remedy which
the High Court can give under the Constitution, then the petitioner must exhaust that remedy before
he comes to the High Court for the exercise of its special jurisdiction under Articles. 226 and 227.
Thus where a dismissed police constable instead of going to the appellate Tribunal which the Police
Act sets up, comes to the High Court by an application under Article 227 by way, as it were, of a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1570109/ 4Asst. Director Of Mines And ... vs Tarakarama Labour Contract ... on 5 October, 1990
short circuit, the High Court cannot permit the petitioner to do that".
15. But in these cases the orders were passed by the Tribunals or Courts which had jurisdiction to act
within the provisions of law and in those cases where appeal or revision is provided it is held that
Articles 226 and 227 cannot apply. But, in the present case the Consumer Protection Act is not at all
applicable for granting a mining lease and the District Forum had no jurisdiction at all to pass the
impugned order under that enactment. When the Act itself is not applicable, directing the parties to
file appeals or revisions to the authorities created under the said Act will be a futile exercise because
even the appellate authority will not have jurisdiction to pass any order when the Act is not
applicable.
16. As pointed out by the Supreme Court in the decision reported in V.P. State v. Mohd Nooh (1
supra) and Mohd Yunus v. Mohd. Mustaqom (2 supra) referred to above, the High Court can
interfere if the inferior Court or Tribunal acts wholly without jurisdiction or to see that the inferior
Court or Tribunal functions within the limits of its authority. Following the said principle, I agree
with the contention of the petitioner that as the District Forum has no authority to invoke the
jurisdiction under the Consumer Protection Act, the High Court can exercise its jurisdiction under
Article 227 of the Constitution of India and interfere.
17. In view of my conclusion that the Consumer Protection Act is not applicable to the leases granted
by the Government under the Andhra Pradesh Minor Mineral Concession Rules and therefore the
District Consumers Forum of Khammam had no jurisdiction to pass any order regarding the grant
of the lease, the petitioner can challenge such order by way of Revision under Article 227 of the
Constitution of India before the High Court even though it had not filed any appeal as provided
under Section 15 of the Consumer Protection Act.
18. The Revision Petition is allowed and the order of the District Consumers Forum, Khammam
dated 5th September, 1989 in C.D.M.P.No. 5 of 1989 is set aside. No costs. Government Pleader's fee
Rs. 200/-.
W.P. 15335/1989.
19. The petitioner ie., Tarakarama Labour Co-operative Society has filed the petition under Article
226 of the Constitution of India to issue any appropriate writ, order or direction and call for the
records on the file of the 1st respondent ie., Deputy Director of Mines and Geology, Warangal and
quash the order dated 20-7-1989 and further direct the respondents to execute the lease in favour of
the petitioner society as per the order dated 23-4-1989.
20. The contention of the Government is that under Rule 13 of the A.P. Minor Mineral Concession
Rules the lease deed shall be executed within 90 days from the date of grant of lease or within such
further period as the Director may allow and if no such lease deed is executed within the said period
due to any default on the part of the applicant, the Deputy Director may revoke the order granting
the lease. Therefore, since the petitioner has not executed the lease deed, within the prescribed
period the lease is not completed. The learned counsel for the petitioner has pointed out that though
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1570109/ 5Asst. Director Of Mines And ... vs Tarakarama Labour Contract ... on 5 October, 1990
the petitioner has paid the necessary fees and filed the draft of the lease deed it is not executed by
the department and so he is not at fault. Further he contends that no order is issued by the Deputy
Director revoking the grant of lease dated 23-4-1989. He contends that the order of the Deputy
Director passed on 20-7-1989 apportioning ac. 1.00 of land to each society is not at all in accordance
with the rules and therefore as the order dt. 23-4-1989 is not revoked the authorities may be
directed to execute the lease deed in favour of the petitioner.
21. Rule 35 of the A.P. Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 1966 provides for an appeal against any
order passed by the Assistant Director or Deputy Director under these rules to the Director within a
period of two months from the date of communication of such order to the party aggrieved. Rule
35-A provides for revision to the Government against any order passed by the Director, Deputy
Director or Assistant Director. It is, therefore, contended that as there is an effective alternative
remedy the petitioner cannot file writ petition without exhausting the remedies provided by the
Rules. In K.K. Shrivastava v. B.K. Jain, it is pointed out," It is well settled law that while Article 226
of the Constitution confers a wide power on the High Court there are equally well settled limitations
which this Court has repeatedly pointed out on the exercise of such power. One of them which is
relevant for the present case is that where there is an appropriate or equally efficacious remedy the
Court should keep its hands off". In Sheonath Prasad Moti Lal v. Income-tax Office, 47 I.T. Reports
493 relied on by the learned counsel for the petitioner the Allahabad High Court pointed out that
"where a writ of Certiorari is concerned the existence of an alternative remedy can be no bar. In any
case the existence of an alternative remedy is only one of the matters to be taken into consideration
by the court in exercising its discretion under Article 226."
22. In this case the petitioner has applied for the lease under the Minor Mineral Concession Rules to
the Deputy Director and he granted the same. He is challenging the subsequent orders of the Deputy
Director modifying the earlier order granting lease of ac. 2.00 and restricting it to one acre. That
order was also passed by the Deputy Director acting under the Mineral Concession Rules. The Rules
provide for an appeal to the Director and Revision to the Government against any order passed by
the Deputy Director. Therefore, there is alternative and effective remedy. Following the decision of
the Supreme Court referred to above, I agree with the contention of the learned Government Pleader
that the petitioner cannot file the writ petition without exhausting the alternative remedy. The writ
petition is therefore dismissed. No costs. Government Pleader's fee Rs. 200/-
W P. 13342/1989:
23. This petition is filed by two petitioners who have applied for grant of mining lease but their
applications were not considered. They sought a writ, order or direction in the nature of Mandamus
declaring that they are entitled to quarry any building stone without the necessity of lease or
permission in Ramayyagutta, Khammam by virtue of G.O.Ms.No. 19 Industries and Commerce dt.
6-1-1971 and further declaring that the grant of lease to the 2nd respondent i.e., Tarakarama Labour
Contract Co-op. Society by the 1st respondent is illegal, arbitrary and void. Their case is that they
belong to Vaddera Communny who earn their livelihood by cutting the stones for building or roads
and selling the same. They allege that about 200 families of Vaddera Community are eking out their
livelihood by cutting stone in the hillock in S.No. 64 which is called Ramanayya-gutta in an area of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1570109/ 6Asst. Director Of Mines And ... vs Tarakarama Labour Contract ... on 5 October, 1990
about ac. 2.00 for the last 30 years. Under G.O.Ms.No. 19 Industries and Commerce dt. 6-1-1971
Vadderas are exempted from payment of seigniorage fees as well as obtaining lease or permit for
working any quarry or building stone, road metal etc. for local purposes. However, the petitioners
were advised to make application to the 1st respondent for grant of lease by way of abundant caution
and accordingly they submitted application on 30-6-89 by paying the necessary fees. But the 1st
respondent is not taking any further steps to consider their application on the ground that the
matter is pending in the Court.
24. In the counter filed on behalf of the 1st respondent it is stated that though the petitioners have
applied for grant of quarry lease on 10-6-89 stating that they are stone cutters they have not
mentioned their caste in the application form nor submitted proof of caste from the competent
authority. For some time past Vadderas are working on Ramanayyagutta which is situated in S.No.
64 of Burahanpuram of Khamman town and they were exempted from payment of seigniorage fee
etc. under Order O.Ms.No. 19 dt. 6-8-71. The Vadderas can work in the quarry as long as some other
person has not applied for lease and now after the amendment to Rule 12 of the Mineral Concession
Rules no quarry lease for stone can be granted other than Vadderas and professional quarry cutters.
Therefore, the orders in G.O.Ms.No. 19 are no longer in force after the amendment of the rules. It is
further contended that the applications are deemed to have been refused as they could not be
disposed of within 90 days.
25. Rule 5 of the A.P. Minor Mineral Concession Rules of 1966 provides that no person shall
undertake quarrying of any minor mineral in any area, except under and in accordance with the
terms and conditions of a quarry lease or a permit granted under these rules, provided that the
Government shall have the power to grant exemption from obtaining a lease or permit for quarrying
any minor mineral in any area in the case of any category of persons, subject to such conditions as
may be specified in the order granting such exemption. In G.O.Ms.No. 19 the Government directed
that all stone-workers by profession, who work by their own manual labour or by that of their
families, shall be exempted from the levy of seigniorage fees as well as the requirement of obtaining
lease or permit, for working any quarries of rough stone, building stone, road metal etc. By
G.O.Ms.No. 29 Industries and Commerce dt 12-1-1976 the orders in G.O.Ms.No. 19 dt. 6-1-71 and
G.O.Ms.No. 1052 dt. 21-11-76 were modified to the extent that the Vadderas be allowed the
concession given in the said G.Os. or in . cases where they produce the minor minerals for the
limited/local sales consumption and where the Public Works Department, Railways, Zilla Parishads
and other contractors are not involved in utilisation of the material quarries by the Vadderas or
other professional quarry workers. No doubt according to G.O.Ms.No. 19 as modified by G.O.Ms.
No; 29 Vadderas can carry on the quarrying without obtaining any lease or permit for a limited
purpose. But that is as long as the Government does not lease out the land to others. The
Government has to the right to lease out the lands to others in accordance with the rules. Rule 12
deals with grant of quarry lease on application and it gives the priorities. The Rule was amended and
the Rule as it now stands gives the priorities as follows:-
(i) Applications of Co-op. Societies consisting exclusively of professional/traditional stone cutters
(Vadderas, etc.) their family members or by the use of machinery;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1570109/ 7Asst. Director Of Mines And ... vs Tarakarama Labour Contract ... on 5 October, 1990
(ii) Applications of individual professional/traditional stones cutters (Vadderas, etc.);
(iii) Applications of Government Departments and Government Corporations and Government
Companies provided they directly undertake quarrying departmentally without sub-contracting the
work to others.
As I have stated above the petitioners have also applied for grant of the mining lease under Rule 12.
According to the Rule the first priority should go to Co-operative Societies consisting exclusively of
professional stone cutters and then the applications of individuals have to be considered. The
contention of the Government is that the petitioners have not mentioned their caste that they are
Vadderas in that application and did not produce proof thereof and their applications were not
considered and they are deemed to have been lapsed under Rule 13 of the Rules which says that the
application for the grant of a quarry lease should be dispossed of within ninety days from the date of
its receipt and if it is not disposed of within that period, the application shall be deemed to have
been refused. The learned Government Pleader has further contended that if the petitioners were
aggrieved as their applications were not considered by the Deputy Director, they could have filed
revision before the Government as required under Rule 35-A which provides that the Government
may either suo motu at any time or on an application made within ninety days, call for and examine
the record relating to any order passed or proceeding taken by the Director, Deputy Director or
Assistant Director, under these rules for the purpose of satisfying themselves as to the legality or
propriety of such order or as to the regularity of such proceedings and pass such order in reference
thereto as they think fit.
26. Though the petitioners now allege in this writ petition that as they belong to Vsddera community
and so they are entitled to carry on the quarrying without any lease or permit as per the exemption
granted in G.O.Ms.No. 19 dt. 6-1-1971, they have applied to the Deputy Director for grant of lease,
under Rule 12 of the Rules. Those applications were not considered by the Deputy Director for some
reason or other and if they are aggrieved by that they have a remedy under Rule 35-A by way of rev
ision to the Government. But, without exhausting that remedy, which is provided by the statutory
rules they have filed this writ petition. I, therefore, agree with the contention of the learned
Government Pleader that the writ petition is not maintainable.
27. Accordingly W.P. 13342/1989 is dismissed. No costs. Government Pleader's fee Rs. 200/-.
