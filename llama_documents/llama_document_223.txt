VALMIKI J. MEHTA, J (ORAL)
1. This is a suit filed for possession, declaration, mesne profits/damages, perpetual injunction and
mandatory injunction. The suit property is the property bearing no.8/289, Sunder Vihar, Paschim
Vihar, New Delhi-110087 on a plot admeasuring 267 sq yds. There are two plaintiffs in the suit.
Plaintiff no.1 is Smt. Vaneeta Khanna and who is the wife of plaintiff no.2/Mr. Arun Khanna.
Plaintiff no.1 pleads that she purchased rights in the suit property in terms of the original bunch of
documentation dated 12.5.2004 read with the registered Agreement to Sell dated 16.6.2004
executed by plaintiff no.2 as a general power of attorney holder (registered) of defendant no.2. There
are six defendants in the suit. Defendant no.1/Mr. Rajiv Gupta is the original owner of the suit
property. Defendant no.2/Mr. Judge Chawla is said to be the person who had purchased the suit
property from defendant no.1 in terms of documents dated 12.5.2004 including the registered
General Power of Attorney dated 12.5.2004 executed by the defendant no.1 in favour of the
defendant no.2. Defendant nos. 3 to 6 claim to be the bona fide purchasers of the suit property in
terms of the later documentation dated 14.9.2004.

2. The case as pleaded by the plaintiffs is that plaintiff no.1 purchased rights in the suit property as
per documentation dated 12.5.2004 and which documents are an agreement to sell, general power
of attorney, registered Will, possession letter, receipt and affidavit. Out of these documents, the
power of attorney executed in favour of plaintiff no.2 by the defendant no.2 was duly registered
before the Sub-Registrar. One more document which was registered on 12.5.2004 is the Will
executed in favour of plaintiff no.1 by defendant no.2. Other documents are unregistered
documents. The case of the plaintiffs is that for acquiring ownership rights in the suit property in
terms of the documentation dated 12.5.2004, a sum of Rs.5 lacs by a crossed cheque was paid by the
plaintiff no.1 to the defendant no.2. The further case of the plaintiffs is that the Agreement to Sell
executed on 12.5.2004 could not be registered on account of certain deficiency in stamp duty and
therefore after making up the deficiency of stamp duty, the fresh Agreement to Sell was executed
and registered on 16.6.2004 in favour of plaintiff no.1 by the plaintiff no.2 acting under the
registered Power of Attorney dated 12.5.2004 executed by the defendant no.2 in favour of the
plaintiff no.2. Plaintiffs plead that they received possession of the suit property pursuant to the
aforesaid documentation executed in favour of the plaintiff no.1. Plaintiffs also plead that since the
suit property was to be got converted from lease hold to free hold, therefore, on the request of the
defendant no.2, plaintiff no.1 in trust gave some signed papers in blank to the defendant no.2 so that
necessary papers could be prepared and filed for conversion of the property from lease hold to free
hold before the Delhi Development Authority (DDA). Plaintiffs claim that the defendant no.2
misused these blank papers and instead created/fabricated a collaboration agreement with respect
to rights in favour of defendant no.2 by the plaintiff no.2 of the second floor and above of the suit
property, and this was done because really the suit property when purchased by the plaintiff no.1
was constructed only on the ground floor and the first floor portion i.e defendant no.2 had a
fraudulent intention because he realized that he could take advantage alongwith defendant no.1 that
the documents executed in favour of the plaintiffs referred to the suit property with only as being the
ground floor and the first floor. The further case of the plaintiffs is that when plaintiffs visited the
suit property on 24.7.2004, it transpired that the locks which the plaintiff no.1 had put on the suit
property on execution of the documents in favour of the plaintiff no.1, were broken and the locks
were found to be broken by the defendant no.1. Plaintiffs claim that they were shocked by the action
of the defendant no.1 in trespassing into the suit property and therefore a complaint was lodged with
the local police station on 24.7.2004 with respect to the illegal act of trespass of the defendant no.1
in the suit property and dispossession of the plaintiffs. The defendant no.1 when called by the police
informed that his sisters had filed a suit for partition against him and in that civil suit a status quo
Order was passed by the Civil Court on 6.9.2000 restraining the defendant no.1 from transferring
the suit property. Plaintiffs were shocked to learn about the pendency of the suit filed by the sisters
and the plaintiffs realized that they were being cheated by the defendant nos.1 and 2. Plaintiff no.1
claims that the sisters of the defendant no.1 had already executed a registered Relinquishment Deed
in favour of the defendant no.1 on 20.5.2002 and in fact on 17/18.12.2002 the defendant no.1's
name was mutated in the records of the DDA as the sole owner of the suit property. Plaintiffs plead
that defendant nos.1 and 2 have thereafter illegally and fraudulently got executed documents dated
17.8.2004, 19.8.2004 and 9.9.2004 whereby defendant no.2 claims that he had no rights in the suit
property and it was only defendant no.1 who was the owner of the suit property and the defendant
no.1 thereafter purports to have executed documents allegedly transferring rights in the suit
property in favour of defendant nos.3 to 6 by the documents dated 14.9.2004 and received a sale
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119689183/ 2Mrs. Vaneeta Khanna And Anr. vs Mr. Rajiv Gupta And Ors. on 1 October, 2015
consideration of Rs.11.65 lacs. Plaintiffs have referred to the FIR no.938/2004 which was registered
with the police station with respect to the fraudulent dispossession of the plaintiffs of the suit
property and the illegality of the documents executed by defendant no.2 in favour of the defendant
no.1 and the subsequent documentation executed by the defendant no.1 in favour of defendant nos.3
to 6. Plaintiffs had earlier filed a civil suit bearing no.393/2004 before the District Court of Delhi
under Sections 5 and 6 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 seeking possession and also had sought
permanent injunction and mesne profits with respect to the suit property. This suit was dismissed
by the District Court by its Judgment dated 27.11.2004 on the application under Order VII Rule 11 of
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) filed by the defendant no.1 in the said suit Mr. Rajiv Gupta
and who is the defendant no.1 in the present suit. The suit was rejected under Order VII Rule 11 CPC
on the ground that plaintiffs had suppressed the fact with respect to existence of the Collaboration
Agreement dated 18.5.2004 entered into by the plaintiff no.2 with the defendant no.2 herein. This
earlier suit was dismissed after the District Court recorded the statement of the plaintiff no.2 in the
present suit (and who was plaintiff no.1 in the said suit) on 28.9.2004 when plaintiff no.1 in the said
suit Sh. Arun Khanna stated that he had seen the collaboration agreement and his signatures
appeared on the collaboration agreement but it was not known as to how the defendant no.2 in the
said suit Mr. Judge Chawla (and who is also defendant no.2 in the present suit) had obtained the
signatures of Sh. Arun Khanna on this collaboration agreement. The judgment of the District Court
was challenged before the High Court but that challenge was not successful and this Court vide its
Judgment dated 2.3.2006 in RFA No.631/2004 dismissed the appeal. The matter was thereafter
carried to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court dismissed the SLP but gave liberty and
entitlement to the plaintiffs to file a suit inasmuch as the earlier suit before the District Court filed
by the plaintiffs had been dismissed only under Order VII Rule 11 CPC. This Order of the Supreme
Court dated 28.4.2006 reads as under:-
"The petitioners herein had filed a Suit purported to be under the provisions of
Section 5 & 6 of the Specific Relief Act. However, in the said Suit the petitioners had
prayed for grant of permanent injunction or in the alternative recovery of possession
or in the further alternative a decree for specific performance of contract. Such a Suit
was not maintainable in law. However, the learned Judge had dismissed the Suit
purported to be in terms of Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure on the
ground that the plaintiff has prayed a fraud by withholding the relevant agreement
and material in the matter.
In view of the fact that the plaintiff can file an appropriate suit, we do not think it to
be a fit case for us to exercise our discretionary jurisdiction under Article 136 of the
Constitution. The special leave petition is dismissed accordingly." (underlining
added) The present suit was thereafter filed by the plaintiffs.
3. Though defendant no.2 appeared and filed his written statement. He however
subsequently failed to appear and was proceeded ex parte but those ex parte
proceedings were thereafter set aside and defendant no.2 was allowed to lead
evidence. Defendant no.1 on the other hand never filed his written statement but
surprisingly he appeared and cross-examined the witnesses of the plaintiffs. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119689183/ 3Mrs. Vaneeta Khanna And Anr. vs Mr. Rajiv Gupta And Ors. on 1 October, 2015
main contesting defendants in the suit are actually the defendant nos.3 to 6 who
claim to be the bona fide purchasers of the suit property in terms of the later
documentation dated 14.9.2004. As per the case of the defendant nos.3 to 6, they
have purchased rights in the suit property from the defendant no.1 in terms of the
documentation dated 14.9.2004, and as already stated above, the documentation
dated 14.9.2004 was preceded by the documentation executed on 17.8.2004,
19.8.2004 and 9.9.2004 whereby defendant no.2 is said to have firstly cancelled the
GPA in favour of the plaintiff no.2 by the defendant no.2 and defendant no.2 gave a
declaration that it is the defendant no.1 who is the owner of the suit property and is
entitled to deal with the same. Accordingly, defendant no.1 thereafter pleaded by
defendants no. 2 to 6 has executed the documentation dated 14.9.2004 in favour of
defendant nos.3 to 6. In the written statement of defendant nos.3 to 5, these
defendants have pleaded that the present suit is barred by the principle of res
judicata and that the suit has not been properly valued for the purposes of court fees
and jurisdiction. Defendant nos.3 to 6 have also pleaded that plaintiffs have not come
to this Court with clean hands. Defendant nos.3 to 6 have denied the legal validity of
the documents executed in favour of the plaintiffs by defendant no.2.

8) Relief."
Issue No.1
5. Let me first take up issue no.1, and which is the most crucial issue in the present case as to
whether the plaintiff no.1 can be said to have purchased rights in the suit property under the
documentation dated 12.5.2004 and the registered Agreement to Sell dated 16.6.2004. The
documents which have been proved and exhibited by the plaintiffs in support of their case are as
under:-
(i) Registered General Power of Attorney dated 12.5.2004 executed by defendant no.1
in favour of defendant no.2; Ex.PW1/1
(ii) Agreement to Sell in favour of plaintiff no.1 by defendant no.2 dated
(iii) Registered General Power of Attorney executed by defendant no.2 in favour of
plaintiff no.2; Ex.PW1/6
(iv) Receipt dated 12.5.2004 by defendant no.2 in favour of plaintiff no.1;
(v) Affidavit dated 12.5.2004 by defendant no.2 in favour of plaintiff no.1;
(vi) Registered Will dated 12.5.2004 executed by defendant no.2 in favour
(vii) Registered Agreement to Sell dated 16.6.2004 executed by plaintiff no.2 in
favour of plaintiff no.1 acting as the registered Power of Attorney holder dated
12.5.2004 of defendant no.2 in favour of plaintiff no.2;
(viii) Police complaint dated 24.7.2004 of the plaintiff no.1 being illegally
(ix) Order of the Supreme Court in SLP No.6902/2006 dated 28.4.2006;
6. With respect to whether the documents dated 12.5.2004 read with registered Agreement to Sell
dated 16.6.2004, and which documents have transferred the title and possession to the plaintiffs,
create or do not create any legal rights in favour of plaintiff no.1 with respect to the suit property, the
arguments urged on behalf of the defendant nos.3 to 6 have to be examined at this stage. The first
argument urged on behalf of the defendant nos.3 to 6 in this regard is that as per the plaint, the
plaintiff no.1 claims to be the owner of the suit property by the documents including the Agreement
to Sell dated 12.5.2004, but since the Agreement to Sell dated 12.5.2004 is an unregistered
Agreement to Sell, hence no rights in the suit property were created in favour of the plaintiff no.1 in
view of the amended Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882; by the Act 48 of 2001 w.e.f
24.9.2001; inasmuch as after 24.9.2001 an agreement to sell can only be looked into if the
agreement to sell is duly stamped and registered. Secondly, it is argued on behalf of the defendant
nos.3 to 6 that the registered Agreement to Sell dated 16.6.2004 shows the lie of the plaintiffs that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119689183/ 5Mrs. Vaneeta Khanna And Anr. vs Mr. Rajiv Gupta And Ors. on 1 October, 2015
Agreement to Sell dated 12.5.2004 could not be registered on the same date on account of deficiency
in the stamp duty inasmuch the stamp duty of the registered agreement to sell shows that the same
was purchased earlier in April, 2004, i.e prior to the documentation dated 12.5.2004 in favour of
plaintiff no.1, and this Court therefore should not believe the case urged on behalf of the plaintiffs
that the Agreement to Sell dated 12.5.2004 could not be registered on account of deficiency of stamp
duty. Thirdly, it is argued that plaintiffs have not filed the documents said to have been executed on
12.5.2004 in favour of defendant no.2 by defendant no.1 and by which defendant no.2 is said to have
become owner of the suit property for further transferring the suit property in favour of the plaintiff
no.1. Fourthly, it is argued that the documents of May, 2004 could not have been validly and legally
executed by defendant nos.1 and 2 in favour of plaintiff no.1, inasmuch as on this date the interim
Order dated 6.9.2000 passed in the suit of the sisters of the defendant no.1 was operating and which
interim order continued to operate till 3.9.2004 and therefore during the operation of an interim
order of a Civil Court, no valid title could have passed from the defendant nos.1 and 2 to the plaintiff
no.1. Fifthly and finally it is argued that even before the documents dated 12.5.2004 were executed
in favour of the plaintiff no.1 by the defendant no.1, in favour of the defendant nos.3 to 6 there were
executed and existed the documentation dated 22.3.2004 being the registered General Power of
Attorney dated 22.3.2004 and a registered Will dated 22.3.2004.
7. On behalf of the defendants the following documents have been proved and relied upon:-
(i) Registered General Power of Attorney dated 22.3.2004 executed by defendant no.1
in favour of defendant no.3; Ex.D-1
(ii) Registered Will dated 22.3.2004 executed by defendant no.1 in favour of
defendant no.3; Ex.D-2
(iii) Registered Agreement to Sell dated 14.9.2004 by defendant no.1 in favour of
defendant nos.3 to 5; Ex.D-3W1/6
(iv) Receipt dated 14.9.2004 in favour of defendant nos.3 to 5;
Ex.D3W1/10
(v) Judgment of the District Court dated 27.11.2004; Ex.PW1/16
(vi) Judgment dated 2.3.2006 in RFA No.631/2004; Ex.PW1/17
8. At this stage Section 48 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 requires to be referred to. This
section provides that when with respect to one property documents of transfer of rights therein are
executed at different points of time, then, earlier documents would prevail over later documents.
Section 48 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 reads as under:-
"48. Priority of rights created by transfer.-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119689183/ 6Mrs. Vaneeta Khanna And Anr. vs Mr. Rajiv Gupta And Ors. on 1 October, 2015
Where a person purports to create by transfer at different times rights in or over the
same immovable property, and such rights cannot all exist or be exercised to their full
extent together, each later created right shall, in the absence of a special contract or
reservation binding the earlier transferees, be subject to the rights previously
created."
9. When a person owns a property he owns a bundle of rights ie an owner may let out the
property-one right, he may then mortgage the same- second right, and then he may sell whatever
rights remaining, in him as a mortgagor of a tenanted property-a third right. In my opinion, rights
which are talked of in any property which is the subject matter of Section 48 of the Transfer of
Property Act, would include rights either in whole or in part of the property and either entire
ownership rights or even part rights in the property. Section 48 of the Transfer of Property Act
specifically uses the expression rights in an immovable property and not complete ownership rights
indicating that once different rights exist in an immovable property; qua one right in an immovable
property which is transferred at one earlier point of time, the said earlier transaction will prevail
over a right of the same nature created later qua the same immovable property. For example, if a
tenancy right is created with respect to one floor in a property on one date and thereafter tenancy
rights are again created with respect to the same floor on a later date, then the earlier tenancy rights
created will prevail over the later created tenancy rights. Tenancy rights are obviously lesser rights
than the complete ownership rights in a suit property. Therefore, if valid rights are created as per
the doctrine of part performance of Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act in favour of the
plaintiff no.1, even if thereafter there are rights created in the suit property in favour of defendant
nos.3 to 6 in terms of the later documents relied upon by them, such later documents are of no
purport and effect because once rights have already been transferred by an earlier set of documents,
merely because subsequent set of documents are created the said later documentation cannot
transfer rights ie nemo dat quod non habet.
10. The arguments urged on behalf of defendant nos.3 to 6 have to be rejected that plaintiffs are
claiming rights in the suit property only by the documentation dated 12.5.2004 which being
unregistered did not create any rights, inasmuch as, the contents of the plaint have to be read as a
whole and when so done it is seen that plaintiffs are claiming rights in the suit property not only in
terms of the documentation dated 12.5.2004 but also in terms of the registered Agreement to Sell
dated 16.6.2004. Once the Agreement to Sell dated 16.6.2004 is duly stamped and registered,
plaintiff no.1 will under Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 have rights in the suit
property and better rights than those created under any subsequent date documents which are
executed with respect to the suit property by either the defendant no.1 or defendant no.2 or
defendant nos.1 and 2 jointly. Also, it is relevant to note that at the time of executing of the
registered Agreement to Sell dated 16.6.2004 by the plaintiff no.2 in favour of plaintiff no.1, plaintiff
no.2 was acting under the valid and subsisting registered Power of Attorney executed on 12.5.2004
by the defendant no.2 in favour of the plaintiff no.2 as such Power of Attorney was not cancelled
when the Agreement to Sell dated 16.6.2004 was executed by the plaintiff no.2 in favour of the
plaintiff no.1. Transferring of possession to plaintiffs is mentioned in the Agreements to Sell dated
12.05.2004 and 16.6.2004. Also, in the written statement of the defendant no.2 there is no dispute
that defendant no.2 executed the documents dated 12.05.2004 and the defence is only that these
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119689183/ 7Mrs. Vaneeta Khanna And Anr. vs Mr. Rajiv Gupta And Ors. on 1 October, 2015
documents were executed as security and which documents alleged were given up in the
Collaboration Agreement dated 18.05.2004 being executed between the plaintiff no.2 and the
defendant no.2. As will be discussed below, the defendant no.2 has failed to prove any Collaboration
Agreement dated 18.05.2004. In my opinion, therefore plaintiff no.1 did get valid title rights in the
suit property in terms of the documentation dated 12.5.2004 read with the registered Agreement to
Sell dated 16.6.2004.
11(i). It was then argued on behalf of the defendant nos.3 to 6 that once the defendant nos.3 to 6 had
in fact rights prior in date to the plaintiff no.1 in the suit property inasmuch as defendant nos.3 to 6
had in their favour the earlier executed registered Power of Attorney and the Will dated 22.3.2004,
then by the selfsame logic of Section 48 of the Transfer of Property Act, the defendant nos.3 to 6
would hence be owners of the suit property and not the plaintiff no.1. The argument of the
defendant nos.3 to 6 is impressive only at the first blush, however the argument is really without any
substance and liable to be rejected for reasons given hereinafter.
(ii) Firstly, the defendant nos.3 to 6 have made no whisper at all of these documents dated
22.3.2004 in their written statement and have not pleaded any rights in their favour in terms of
these documents dated 22.3.2004. No such issue has also been framed of defendant nos. 3 to 6
having title rights because of the documents dated 22.3.2004. The documents dated 22.3.2004 were
introduced only at the stage of evidence of the defendants. Thus on the principle that no amount of
evidence can be looked at on a case which is not put up, these documents cannot be looked into to
create rights in favour of defendant nos. 3 to 6. In my opinion, counsel for the plaintiffs is correct in
arguing that the defendant nos.3 to 6 did not rely upon the documents dated 22.3.2004 in their
favour because rights under those documents had been given up and never enforced and knowing so
for that reason, the defendant nos.3 to 6 never relied upon or wanted to take benefit of the
documents dated 22.3.2004 by claiming rights under such documents in terms of their pleadings. It
is only during the course of the evidence being led in the suit that the defendant nos.3 to 6 suddenly
realized that they may not succeed on the basis of the documents dated 14.9.2004 executed in their
favour and therefore they thought it fit to introduce a totally new case under the documents dated
22.3.2004 and which admittedly is not even pleaded.
(iii) The second reason for not giving any valid entitlement to the defendant nos.3 to 6 of the
documents dated 22.3.2004 is that these documents dated 22.3.2004 do not reflect that possession
of the suit property under these documents was specifically given to the defendant nos.3 to 6 by the
defendant no.1 as I do not find any language in these documents dated 22.3.2004 which
categorically states that possession of the suit property was transferred by defendant no.1 in favour
of the defendant nos.3 to 6.
(iv) Thirdly, it may also be noted that entitlement to remain in possession has to be in terms of a
document which gives both legal and physical possession and entitlement to legal possession is only
through the doctrine of part performance under Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act in terms
of a registered agreement to sell only, but such a registered agreement to sell admittedly does not
exist in favour of the defendant nos.3 to 6 as on 22.3.2004 because on 22.3.2004 the documents
executed and in favour of the defendant nos.3 to 6 were only a Power of Attorney and a registered
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119689183/ 8Mrs. Vaneeta Khanna And Anr. vs Mr. Rajiv Gupta And Ors. on 1 October, 2015
Will and that too without there being given possession of the suit property as stated above.
(v) Therefore, in my opinion defendant nos.3 to 6 cannot rely upon the documents dated 22.3.2004
of they either having been given title rights in the suit property by these documents or having been
given possession of the suit property by these documents or having been given possession in the
nature of part performance under Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act in terms of the
documents dated 22.3.2004.
12. At this point it requires to be noted that a contractual document can only be cancelled by a
contractual document i.e if a sale deed is executed, then it is not open to a seller of a sale deed to
unilaterally cancel the contractual document being a sale deed. This I am saying so because if rights
are validly created in the suit property in favour of the plaintiff no.1 by the documents dated
12.5.2004 and 16.6.2004, then merely because thereafter defendant nos.1 and 2 have executed
various cancellation deeds cancelling any rights in the suit property of the plaintiff no.1, such
unilateral actions surely cannot have the legal effect of taking away and cancel the valid title rights
which the plaintiff no.1 had in the suit property by virtue of the documents dated 12.5.2004 and
16.6.2004 in her favour. Thus all documents executed after 12.5.2004 and 16.6.2004 in favour of
anyone by the defendant nos. 1 and 2 jointly or severally are illegal, null and void including the
documents dated 17.8.2004, 19.8.2004 and 14.9.2004 and these latter documents post 16.6.2004
are accordingly declared to be null and void and of no legal effect.
13. I also reject the argument urged on behalf of the defendant nos.3 to 6 that the judgment of the
Supreme Court in the case of Suraj Lamp and Industries Private Limited Vs. State of Haryana and
Anr., (2012) 1 SCC 656 helps the defendant nos.3 to 6 to show that the documents dated 12.5.2004
and 16.6.2004 do not create any rights in favour of the plaintiff no.1. This is because paras 19 and 24
of the judgment in the case of Suraj Lamp and Industries Private Limited (supra) in fact protect the
rights created under Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act and these paras 19 and 24 of the
judgment in the case of Suraj Lamp and Industries Private Limited (supra) read as under:-
"19. Any contract of sale (agreement to sell) which is not a registered deed of
conveyance (deed of sale) would fall short of the requirements of Sections 54 and 55
of Transfer of Property Act and will not confer any title nor transfer any interest in an
immovable property (except to the limited right granted under Section 53A of
Transfer of Property Act). According to Transfer of Property Act, an agreement of
sale, whether with possession or without possession, is not a conveyance. Section 54
of Transfer of Property Act enacts that sale of immoveable property can be made only
by a registered instrument and an agreement of sale does not create any interest or
charge on its subject matter.
24. We therefore reiterate that immovable property can be legally and lawfully
transferred/conveyed only by a registered deed of conveyance. Transactions of the
nature of 'GPA sales' or 'SA/GPA/WILL transfers' do not convey title and do not
amount to transfer, nor can they be recognized or valid mode of transfer of
immoveable property. The courts will not treat such transactions as completed or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119689183/ 9Mrs. Vaneeta Khanna And Anr. vs Mr. Rajiv Gupta And Ors. on 1 October, 2015
concluded transfers or as conveyances as they neither convey title nor create any
interest in an immovable property. They cannot be recognized as deeds of title,
except to the limited extent of Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act. Such
transactions cannot be relied upon or made the basis for mutations in Municipal or
Revenue Records. What is stated above will apply not only to deeds of conveyance in
regard to freehold property but also to transfer of leasehold property. A lease can be
validly transferred only under a registered Assignment of Lease. It is time that an end
is put to the pernicious practice of SA/GPA/WILL transactions known as GPA sales."
(underlining added) Clearly therefore the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case
of Suraj Lamp and Industries Private Limited (supra) does not help the defendant
nos.3 to 6 but in fact goes against defendant nos. 3 to 6 because the Supreme Court
has held that whatever rights are created under Section 53A of the Transfer of
Property Act are protected and would be available. Also, it is further noted that in the
present case the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Suraj Lamp and
Industries Private Limited (supra) will ex facie not apply because the rationale and
the ratio of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Suraj Lamp and
Industries Private Limited (supra) was to prevent unregistered documents
transferring title in immovable properties that too without payment of stamp duty,
however in the present case the agreement to sell which has been executed is no
doubt post 24.9.2001 i.e after the Act 48 of 2001 came in amending Section 53A of
the Transfer of Property Act, but the Agreement to Sell dated 16.6.2004 is a duly
stamped and registered document as required by law. I therefore reject this argument
urged on behalf of the defendant nos.3 to 6.
14. Defendants no.3 to 6 have argued that the reason given by the plaintiffs of
inadequate stamp duty being the reason for not registering the Agreement to Sell
dated 12.5.2004 is a false one, because, the stamp papers of the Agreement to Sell
dated 16.6.2004 show that they were already purchased in April, 2004 prior to the
execution of the Agreement to Sell dated 12.5.2004 in favour of plaintiff no.1,
however this argument is misconceived because no doubt the stamp papers of the
agreement to sell are of April, 2004 but since there was deficiency of stamp papers of
value of Rs.5,700/-, the deficiency was made up after 12.5.2004 and which is seen
from the stamps of franking qua making up of deficiency in stamp duty on the first
page of the Agreement to Sell dated 16.6.2004.
In any case once the Agreement to Sell dated 16.6.2004 is otherwise a validly
executed and registered document as held above even for the sake of argument that
the plaintiffs have not stated the complete truth cannot simply and only for that
reason be a reason in law to legally discard a validly executed and registered
Agreement to Sell dated 16.6.2004. As repeatedly held by courts, the maxim of falsus
in uno, falsus in omnibus has no application in this country.
15. The defendants no.3 to 6 also have argued that plaintiffs have not filed documents
executed by defendant no.1 in favour of defendant no.2 on 12.5.2004 but in my
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119689183/ 10Mrs. Vaneeta Khanna And Anr. vs Mr. Rajiv Gupta And Ors. on 1 October, 2015
opinion this was not necessary as it is enough for the plaintiffs to have filed and
proved as Ex.PW1/1 the registered GPA dated 12.5.2004 executed by defendant no.1
in favour of defendant no.2 as the documents executed by defendant no.2 in favour of
the plaintiff no.1 is under this registered General Power of Attorney Ex.PW1/1 dated
12.5.2004.
16. Even the argument that documents dated 12.5.2004 were executed in favour of
defendant no.2 and plaintiff no.1 during the currency of an interim order in a suit
filed by the sisters of defendant no.1 and hence are invalid, has no legs to stand upon
firstly because any locus to argue such aspect would be only of the sisters and not of
defendants no.3 to 6 and secondly as clarified by the Supreme Court recently in the
judgment in the case of Thomson Press (India) Limited Vs. Nanak Builders and
Investors P. Ltd. And Ors. (2013) 5 SCC 397 that transfer during pendency of a suit is
only to protect the plaintiff if a suit succeeds because of the principle of lis pendens
under Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act and it is noted that the suit of the
sisters has been compromised with defendant no.1 and withdrawn. Therefore, the
defendant nos. 3 to 6 cannot rely upon this argument and which is rejected.
17. Issue no.1 is therefore decided in favour of the plaintiff no.1 and against the
defendants.
Issue no.3
18. I may note that the alleged Collaboration Agreement dated 18.5.2004 on which a
lot of hullaballoo was created by the defendant no.2 that plaintiff no.2 had executed
this collaboration agreement in favour of the defendant no.2 with respect to the
second floor and above of the suit property, the same has not even been proved by
any of the defendants including the defendant no.2. The original of this collaboration
agreement has not seen the light of the day ever and only a photocopy has been filed
and which has not even been proved by the defendant no.2. Therefore, there is no
valid and legal collaboration agreement which ever came into existence between the
plaintiff no.2 and the defendant no.2. This is all the more so because counsel for the
plaintiffs is justified in arguing that a collaboration agreement by its very nature
means that an owner of a property because of giving rights under the same to a
builder will in fact be got paid certain amounts and not that a builder/defendant no.2
is paid an amount under a collaboration agreement and which is said to have
happened under the Collaboration Agreement dated 18.5.2004 because under the
collaboration agreement it is mentioned that an amount of Rs.5 lacs is paid by cheque
by plaintiff no.2 to the defendant no.2, and which itself therefore as stated above is
totally illogical. Not only this payment of Rs.5 lacs under the so called collaboration
agreement by plaintiff no.2 to defendant no.2 is wholly illogical, this fact itself is
otherwise shown to be a totally imaginary thing because there has never been proved
that any cheque of this number or account of this number stated in the cheque of Rs.5
lacs; alleged to be received by the defendant no.2 from the plaintiff no.2 under the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119689183/ 11Mrs. Vaneeta Khanna And Anr. vs Mr. Rajiv Gupta And Ors. on 1 October, 2015
collaboration agreement; even existed at all. Clearly therefore the collaboration
agreement is a forged and fabricated document and once the same is not proved, I
need not even refer to the same for any rights under the same being created in favour
of the defendant no.2. It also needs to be noted at this stage that defendant no.2 has
not appeared or has been represented during the entire course of hearing of the final
arguments of the present suit before this Court.
19. In view of the discussion given above it is held that there is no Collaboration
Agreement dated 18.5.2004 and this issue is therefore decided in favour of the
plaintiffs and against the defendants. Issue no.2
20. Once the plaintiff no.1 becomes the owner of the title rights in the suit property,
as issue no.1 is decided in favour of the plaintiff no.1, plaintiff no.1 will be entitled to
mesne profits as plaintiff no.1 has been wrongly ousted from the possession of the
suit property. In the affidavit by way of evidence filed by the plaintiff no.1 as PW1,
PW1 has deposed that the rate of rent of the similar premises of the area would be
Rs.15,000/-per month. To this aspect there is no cross-examination whatsoever by
the defendants. Therefore in the absence of cross-examination, the relevant portion
of examination-in-chief is therefore taken as not disputed and hence this Court
accepts an amount of Rs.15,000/- per month as mesne profits of the suit premises.
Also, taking judicial notice of rents in Delhi, I do not find that in the year 2006 a
property situated on a plot of land admeasuring 267 sq yds having a ground floor and
the first floor in the city of Delhi would have rent less than Rs.15,000/- per month.
Plaintiff no.1 is therefore held entitled to a money decree of mesne profits at
Rs.15,000/- per month as against the defendants no.1 and 2 from 24.7.2004 till
14.9.2004 and after 14.9.2004, the defendant nos. 3 to 6 will be liable to pay mesne
profits at Rs.15,000/- per month to the plaintiffs till the plaintiffs receive possession
of the suit property. I also deem it fit to award interest at 9% per annum simple
pendente lite and future in exercise of powers of this Court under Section 34 CPC for
and from end of each month for which mesne profits are payable to the plaintiff no.1
by the defendants in terms of the present judgment till entire amount of mesne
profits alongwith interest is cleared by the defendants to the plaintiff no.1. Issue no.2
is accordingly decided in favour of the plaintiff no.1 and against the defendants.
Issue No.4 21(i). The question to be decided under issue no.4 is that whether the
present suit is barred by res judicata on account of earlier Judgments of the District
Court dated 27.11.2004, High Court dated 2.3.2006 and the Order of the Supreme
Court dated 28.4.2006.
(ii) The Order of the Supreme Court dated 28.4.2006 has already been reproduced
above, and the same leaves no manner of doubt that the Supreme Court has
categorically entitled the plaintiffs to file a fresh suit, inasmuch as, the earlier suit has
only been rejected under Order VII Rule 11 CPC. It is well known that rejection of a
suit under Order VII Rule 11 CPC is not a decision on merits for such an earlier
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119689183/ 12Mrs. Vaneeta Khanna And Anr. vs Mr. Rajiv Gupta And Ors. on 1 October, 2015
decision to operate as res judicata under Section 11 CPC with its Explanations. For
application of the principle of res judicata the earlier decision has to be a decision on
merits and not a technical rejection of the suit. That a technical rejection/dismissal of
a suit does not operate as res judicata is clear from the judgment of the Supreme
Court in the case of Sheodan Singh Vs. Smt. Daryao Kunwar AIR 1966 SC 1332 and
the relevant para of which judgment reads as under:-
"14. This brings us to the main point that has been urged in these appeals, namely,
that the High Court had not heard and finally decided the appeals arising out suits
Nos. 77 and 91. One of the appeals was dismissed on the ground that it was filed
beyond the period of limitation while the other appeal was dismissed on the ground
that the appellant therein had not taken steps to print the records. It therefore urged
that the two appeals arising out of suits Nos. 77 and 91 had not been heard and finally
decided by the High Court, and so the condition that the former suit must have been
heard and finally decided was not satisfied in the present case. Reliance in the
connection is placed on the well- settled principle that in order that a matter may be
said to have been heard and finally decided, the decision in the former suit must have
been on the merits. Where, for example, the former suit was dismissed by the trial
court for want of jurisdiction, or for default of plaintiff's appearance, or on the
ground of non- joinder of parties or mis-joinder of parties or multifariousness, or on
the ground that the suit was badly framed, or on the ground of a technical mistake, or
for failure on the part of the plaintiff to produce probate or letters of administration
or succession certificate when the same is "required by low to entitle the plaintiff to a
decree, or for failure to furnish security for costs, or on the ground of improper
valuation or for failure to pay additional court fee on a plaint which was undervalued
or for want of cause of action or on the ground that it is premature and the dismissal
is confirmed in appeal (if any), the decision not being on the merits would not be res
judicata in a subsequent suit. But none of these considerations apply in the present
case, for the Additional Civil Judge decided all the four suits on the merits and
decided the issue as to title on merits against the appellant and his father. It is true
that the High Court dismissed the appeals arising out of suits Nos. 77 and 91 either
on the ground that it was barred by limitation or on the ground that steps had not
been taken for printing the records. Even so the fact remains that the result of the
dismissal of the two appeals arising from suits Nos. 77 and 91 by the High Court on
these grounds was that the decrees of the Additional Civil Judge who decided the
issue as to title on merits stood confirmed by the order of the High Court. In such a
case, even though the order of the High Court may itself not be on the merit the result
of High Court's decision is to confirm the decision on the issue of title which had been
given on the merits by the Additional Civil Judge and thus it effect the High Court
confirmed the decree of the trial court on the merits, whatever may be the reason for
the dismissal of the appeals arising from suits Nos. 77 and 91. In these circumstances
though the order of the High Court itself may not be on the merits, the decision of the
High Court dismissing the appeals arising out of suits Nos. 77 and 91 was to uphold
the decision on the merits as to issue of title and therefore it must be held that by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119689183/ 13Mrs. Vaneeta Khanna And Anr. vs Mr. Rajiv Gupta And Ors. on 1 October, 2015
dismissing the appeals arising out of suits Nos. 77 and 91 the High Court heard and
finally decided the matter of it confirmed the judgment of the trial court on the issue
of title arising between the parties and decision of the trial court being on the merits
the High Court's decision confirming that decision must also be deemed to be on the
merits. To hold otherwise would make res judicata impossible in cases where the trial
court decides the matter on merits but the appeal court dismisses the appeal on some
preliminary ground thus confirming the decision of the trial court on the merits. It is
well-settled that where a decree on the merits is appealed from, the decision of the
trial court loses its character of finality and what was once res judicata again becomes
res sub judice and it is the decree of appeal court which will then be res judicata. But
if the contention of the appellant were to be accepted and it is held that if the appeal
court dismisses the appeal on any preliminary ground, like limitation or default in
printing, thus confirming in toto the trial court's decision on merits, the appeal
court's decree cannot be res judicata, the result would be that even though the
decision of the trial court given on the merits is confirmed by the dismissal of the
appeal on a preliminary ground there can never be res judicata. We cannot therefore
accept the contention that even though the trial court may have decided the matter
on the merits there can be no res judicata if the appeal court dismisses the appeal on
the preliminary ground without going into the merits, even though the result of the
dismissal of the appeal by the appeal court is confirmation of the decision of the trial
court given on the merits. Acceptance of such a proposition will mean that all that the
losing party has to do to destroy the effect of a decision given by the trial court on the
merits is to file an appeal and let that appeal be dismissed on some preliminary
ground, with the result that the decision given on the merits also becomes useless as
between the parties. We are therefore of opinion that where a decision is given on the
merits by the trial court and the matter is taken in appeal and the appeal is dismissed
on some preliminary ground, like limitation or default in printing, it must be held
that such dismissal when it confirms the decision to the trial court on the merits itself
amounts to the appeal being heard and finally decided on the merits whatever may be
the ground for dismissal of the appeal."
(underlining added)
22. In my opinion, therefore, the earlier judgments of the District Court and the High Court would
not operate as res judicata more so in view of the observations of the Supreme Court in its Order
dated 28.4.2006 specifically observing that the plaintiffs would be entitled to file a fresh suit
inasmuch as dismissal of the earlier suit was only under Order VII Rule 11 CPC.
23. Issue no.4 is therefore decided in favour of the plaintiffs and against the defendants.
Issue no.5.
24. This issue is as to whether defendant nos. 3 to 5 can claim to have title to the suit property as
bona fide purchasers without notice in spite of the plaintiffs having title rights in the suit property
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119689183/ 14Mrs. Vaneeta Khanna And Anr. vs Mr. Rajiv Gupta And Ors. on 1 October, 2015
by virtue of the documents dated 12.5.2004 and 16.6.2004. This issue also will have to be answered
in favour of the plaintiffs and against the defendants for the reasons as given hereinafter.
25(i). A claim of bona fide purchaser for value without notice is in terms of Section 19(b) of the
Specific Relief Act. This provision of Section 19(b) of the Specific Relief Act requires that before
rights are claimed under this particular principle, it is necessary for the subsequent purchasers have
to plead and prove that their actions are firstly bona fide and secondly that they do not have any
notice of a previous transaction of transfer of title with respect to the suit property.
(ii) It is noted that in the written statement of the defendant nos. 3 to 5 they have not even
whispered about their purchase of rights as being bona fide and that they purchased the rights in the
suit property without notice of the earlier title in favour of the plaintiff no.1. Not only there is no
pleading but even in the evidence led on behalf of defendant nos. 3 to 6 there is not even a whisper
that defendant nos. 3 to 6 have purchased rights in the suit property without having notice of the
title created in favour of plaintiff no.1 by the documentation dated 12.5.2004 and 16.6.2004. It is
also seen that once the Agreement to Sell dated 16.6.2004 in favour of the plaintiff no.1 was a
registered document, defendant nos. 3 to 6 are deemed to have notice of this agreement by virtue of
Explanation I to Section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act which provides that registration of a
document operates as a notice. Therefore, neither there is any pleading nor any evidence that
defendant nos.3 to 6 have purchased the rights in the suit property without notice of the prior title
in favour of the plaintiff no.1 and which pleading the defendant nos. 3 to 6 cannot legally take up in
view of Explanation I to Section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act.
(iii) Though learned counsel for the defendant nos. 3 to 6 argued that in the affidavit by way of
evidence filed on behalf of defendant nos. 3 to 6, they have used the expression 'bona fide', however,
not only no amount of evidence can be looked into on the plea of bona fide action of the defendant
nos. 3 to 6 which is not pleaded in the written statement, but also that even assuming there is a plea
of bona fides, the same is not sufficient because the same had to be accompanied by pleadings and
proof of defendant nos. 3 to 6 having purchased rights in the suit property without having notice of
the title of plaintiff no.1, and which the defendant nos. 3 to 6 have miserably failed to plead and
prove as so discussed above.
(iv). Also, in law, once title rights are transferred pursuant to Section 53A of the Transfer of Property
Act, there does not arise application of Section 19(b) of the Specific Relief Act and which applies if
there is only an ordinary agreement to sell which requires specific performance and not an
agreement to sell under Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act. Object of Section 19(b) of the
Specific Relief Act is to give precedence to a later sale deed of bona fide purchases for value without
notice and not for giving precedence to transfer of later rights although rights in an immovable
property has earlier already been validly transferred and in such a case it is the Section 48 of the
Transfer of Property Act that will apply and not Section 19(b) of the Specific Relief Act.
26. I therefore hold that defendant nos. 3 to 6 cannot be said to be bona fide purchasers for value
without notice and issue no.5 is therefore decided in favour of the plaintiffs and against the
defendants. Issue no.6.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119689183/ 15Mrs. Vaneeta Khanna And Anr. vs Mr. Rajiv Gupta And Ors. on 1 October, 2015
27. This issue is inconsequential and therefore is not pressed on behalf of the plaintiffs, inasmuch
as, even assuming there is any collusion between defendant nos. 1 and 2, the same will not affect any
rights of the plaintiff no.1 because plaintiff no.1 contractually has got title rights in the suit property
in her favour by the documentation dated 12.5.2004 and 16.6.2004. This issue is disposed of
accordingly.
Issue no.7
28. This is the final issue to be decided as to whether the suit has been properly valued for the
purpose of court fee and jurisdiction and onus of this issue was placed upon the defendants. Once
evidence is led by both the parties, onus pales into insignificance and I have to examine what is the
evidence existing on record, as to whether the suit can or cannot be said to be properly valued for
the purpose of court fee and jurisdiction.
29. Plaintiff has valued the suit for the purpose of jurisdiction with respect to possession at
Rs.20,05,000/-. On behalf of the defendant nos. 3 to 6 the argument raised is that this Court does
not have pecuniary jurisdiction and the suit is not properly valued because actually the value of suit
property would be around Rs.5 lacs and at which value plaintiff no.1 had purchased the title rights in
the suit property by virtue of documents dated 12.5.2004 and 16.6.2004. It is also argued on behalf
of defendant nos. 3 to 6 that in the earlier civil suit filed in the District Court, plaintiffs had valued
the suit for the purpose of jurisdiction at Rs.5 lacs and therefore, in this suit it cannot be said that
suit is properly valued at Rs.20, 05,000/- for the purpose of giving pecuniary jurisdiction to this
Court.
30(i). Though, counsel for the defendant nos. 3 to 6 wanted this Court to refer to various judgments
on the issue of pecuniary jurisdiction, however, I do not deem it fit to refer to elementary
proposition of law which is cited in judgments because surely it is no doubt the law that courts
cannot entertain suits which are not as per its pecuniary jurisdiction, but, existence of pecuniary
jurisdiction is firstly an issue of fact ie by means of evidence the factual aspect has to be established
and only when the facts come in, it is then that the application of law would be required. There is no
dispute as to the proposition of law that if this Court does not have pecuniary jurisdiction then this
Court cannot try the suit because plaintiff has overvalued the suit.
(ii) The issue is that whether plaintiffs have overvalued the suit. I am of the opinion that as per the
evidence led in the present case, it cannot be held that plaintiffs have overvalued the suit for the
purposes of pecuniary jurisdiction for possession of the suit property. There are various reasons for
this Court to hold so. Firstly in the earlier suit which was filed wherein pecuniary jurisdiction was
mentioned at Rs.5 lacs, the same was filed by the plaintiffs in the year 2004 whereas this suit has
been filed two years later in the year 2006. Surely therefore the value of the property would have
changed from the year 2004 to 2006. Secondly, not only the value of the property would have
changed, admittedly the documentation in favour of the defendant nos. 3 to 6 themselves just within
four months of the documentation in favour of the plaintiffs resulted in doubling the valuation of the
suit property i.e from Rs.5 lacs to Rs.11,65,000/- because Rs. 11,65,000/- is the value stated in the
documents of the defendant nos. 3 to 6.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119689183/ 16Mrs. Vaneeta Khanna And Anr. vs Mr. Rajiv Gupta And Ors. on 1 October, 2015
(iii) I also take judicial notice of the rise in the value of the properties in Delhi.
(iv) Further, it is to be noted that there is no evidence which is led on behalf of the defendants that if
the valuation of the suit property on the date of filing of the suit if was not Rs.20,05,000/- then it
was of which lower specific value. There is no whisper in the entire evidence which is led on behalf
of the defendants no.3 to 6 that the specific value of the suit property is not Rs.20,05,000/- but a
lower amount falling below the pecuniary jurisdiction of this Court.
(v) In view of the above facts, in my opinion, it cannot be held that the suit is not properly valued for
the purpose of court fee and jurisdiction with respect to the relief of possession when the plaintiff
has valued the suit at Rs.20,05,000/- for the cause of action and relief of possession of the suit
property.
31. Issue no.7 is also therefore decided in favour of the plaintiffs and against the defendants.
Relief:-
32. In view of the above discussion all the issues are decided in favour of the plaintiffs and against
the defendants. Suit of the plaintiffs is decreed against the defendants for possession of the property
bearing no. 8/289, Sunder Vihar, Paschim Vihar, New Delhi-110087 admeasuring 267 sq yds. In
case the defendants or any of them have raised any construction on the suit property above the
second floor, then in case the defendants so wish then they can remove such construction without of
course in any manner causing damage to the ground floor and the first floor of the suit property
which construction was existing when the plaintiff no.1 purchased the rights in the suit property and
when plaintiff no.1 was dispossessed from the suit property on 24.7.2004. The defendant nos. 3 to 6
may however state a monetary value of construction over the first floor of the suit property, ie
second floor and above, and the plaintiff no. 1 at her sole option may agree to pay that value to the
defendant nos. 3 to 6 whereby defendant nos. 3 to 6 can receive such value and leave the
construction of second floor and above intact. Plaintiff no.1 will also be entitled to mesne profits at
Rs. 15,000/- per month from 24.7.2004 till 14.9.2004 as against the defendant nos. 1 and 2
alongwith interest at 9% per annum simple pendente lite and future and mesne profits at same rate
from 14.9.2004 at Rs.15,000/- per annum simple from defendant nos. 3 to 6 alongwith pendente
lite and future interest at 9% per annum simple till payment payable for and from the end of the
month when mesne profits are payable. It is also declared that the documentation executed between
the defendants after 16.6.2004 is illegal, void and of no legal effect and the same will not in any
manner cause derogation of the rights of the plaintiff no. 1 in the suit property under the
documentation dated 12.5.2004 and 16.6.2004. Defendants are also injuncted from claiming
themselves to be the owners of the suit property or acting as such. Parties are left to bear their own
costs. Decree sheet be prepared.
