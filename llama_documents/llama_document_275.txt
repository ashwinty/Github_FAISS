Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1775566/ 5Appearance vs Patel Lallubhai Ishverbhai ... on 28 April, 2011
Learned counsel appearing for respective respondents waive service of Rule. At the request of the
learned counsel appearing for the parties, this group of four Special Civil Applications is taken up for
final hearing.
2. These four petitions under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India are directed against
the order dated 15.5.2009 passed by the learned Additional Senior Civil Judge, Vadodara, below
applications Exh. 30 and Exh 47 in Special Civil Suit No.391 of 2001; applications Exh. 26 and Exh
43 in Special Civil Suit No.392 of 2001; applications Exh. 25 and Exh 42 in Special Civil Suit No.393
of 2001; and applications Exh. 25 and Exh 41 in Special Civil Suit No.394 of 2001. The petitioners
are original defendant Nos. 2 to 7; respondent Nos. 1 to 8 are original plaintiffs and respondent No.9
is original defendant No.1, in all four suits being Special Civil Suit Nos. 391 to 394 of 2001.
3 The issue involved in this group of petitions revolves round the non-irrigated agricultural lands
being plot No.4, admeasuring 2 Hectares 7 Are 9 Sq.meters being 1/4th part of Revenue Survey
No.707 admeasuring 8 Hectares 31 Gunthas 63 Sq.meters [for short 'the suit land']. The land
bearing Survey No.707 initially belonged to Vithal Mandir Trust. Under the order dated 6.3.1979 of
the Mamlatdar and Agricultural Land Tribunal in Tenancy Case No.3467 of 1977, Rasiklal Tilakram
Jaiswal was declared as a tenant of the land bearing revenue survey No.707 and became the deemed
purchaser thereof and the same came to be confirmed by the Gujarat Revenue Tribunal, this Court
and the Apex Court.
4 On 30.4.2001, respondent Nos. 1 to 8 filed four suits being Special Civil Suits Nos. 391 to 394 of
2001 against the petitioners and respondent Nos. 9 to 11 for a declaration that the registered sale
deeds dated 14.10.1999 in respect of plot Nos. 1 to 4 were not binding on the plaintiffs and for a
declaration that the petitioners were not entitled to demand from respondent Nos.10 and 11 any
building permission and further restrain them from dealing, plotting, alienation, allotment, etc, of
the land in question on the basis of the impugned sale deeds. On 9.2.2007, it seems that, pending
the suits, a compromise was arrived at between the petitioners and respondent Nos. 1 to 8 and
reduced in writing Exh.32 and, as per the terms and conditions of the above compromise, the
petitioners paid to each of respondent Nos. 1 to 8 Rs.37.50 lakhs aggregating to Rs.3 crores by
cheques as per paragraph 7 of the consent terms and it was agreed to withdraw Regular Civil Suit
no.792 of 2001. On 9.2.2007, respondent Nos. 1 to 8 filed four applications [i] Exh.30 in Special
Civil Suit No.391 of 2001 [ii] Exh.26 in Special Civil Suit No.392 of 2001 [iii] Exh.25 in Special Civil
Suit No.393 of 2001 and [iv] Exh.25 in Special Civil Suit No.394 of 2001 for amendment of the
plaints in the suits by deletion of respondent Nos. 9 to 11 as defendants to the suits and renumbering
the petitioners as defendants Nos. 1 to 6 and it was pointed out that there was a compromise with
the petitioners and no relief remained to be obtained against them.
On 15.2.2007, respondent No.5 made application Exh.35 to withdraw the applications Exh.30, 26,
25 and 25 for amendment of the respective plaints. On 17.2.2007, respondent No.5 made an
application for withdrawing the compromise and cancelling the same in the above suits. Respondent
No.5 made application Exh.40 in Special Civil Suit No.391 of 2001 for depositing Rs.37.50 lakhs. On
13.7.2007, another group of applications Exh.47, 43, 42 and 41 were filed in Special Civil Suit
Nos.391 to 394 of 2001 for taking a decision on the consent terms dated 9.2.2007.

6 The trial court had taken up the case for compromise to be recorded against respondent Nos. 1 to 4
and 6 to 7 and deferred the hearing on the compromise with regard to respondent No.5. On
28.1.2008, the trial court granted the applications Exh.30, 26, 25 and 25 for amendment of the
plaints in the respective civil suits.
7 In the meanwhile, in the revenue proceeding being Revision Application No.319 of 2009, the
Gujarat Revenue Tribunal passed the order on 28.11.2007 directing to regularize the transactions
which have taken place between the parties and, on payment of an amount of premium, the
restriction under Section 43 of the Bombay Tenancy & Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 [for short, 'the
Act'] would be deemed to have been removed and the sale deeds to be regularized. The order dated
28.11.2007 passed by the Gujarat Revenue Tribunal was challenged by respondent No.5 by way of
Special Civil Application No.3070 of 2007 before this Court and execution and operation of the
order dated 28.11.2007 passed by the Gujarat Revenue Tribunal was stayed.
8 Respondent No.5 also filed Special Civil Application Nos. 3117 to 3120 of 2008 before this Court
wherein the Court [Coram: M.R. Shah, J.] passed the judgment and order dated 26.8.2008.
Paragraph 6 of the judgment and order dated 26.8.2008 reads as under:
"6. For the reasons stated above, all the petitions succeed in part. The orders passed below Exh.30 in
Civil Suit No. 391 of 2004; Exh. 26 in Civil Suit No.392 of 2001; Exh.25 in Civil Suit No.393 of 2001
and Exh.25 in Civil Suit No.394 of 2001 are quashed and set aside and the matter is remanded to the
learned trial Court for deciding the application Exh.30 in Civil Suit No. 391 of 2004; Exh. 26 in Civil
Suit No.392 of 2001; Exh.25 in Civil Suit No.393 of 2001 and Exh.25 in Civil Suit No.394 of 2001
afresh in accordance with law and on merits after giving opportunity to all concerned. So far as the
challenge to orders passed by the learned trial Court below Exh.47 in Civil Suit No.391 of 2001;
Exh.43 in Civil Suit No.392 of 2001; Exh.42 in Civil Suit No.393 of 2001 and Exh.41 in Civil Suit
No.394 of 2001 are concerned, present Special Civil Applications are not entertained at this stage by
observing that it will be open for the petitioner to make all submissions which are raised in the
present Special Civil Applications while challenging the orders passed below Exh.47 in Civil Suit
No.391 of 2001; Exh.43 in Civil Suit No.392 of 2001; Exh.42 in Civil Suit No.393 of 2001 and Exh.41
in Civil Suit No.394 of 2001 inclusive of applicability of Order XXIII Rule 1 Sub-Rule (5); Order
XXIII Rule 3 and provisio and explanation thereto of the C.P.C. and considering the submissions
with respect to validity of the compromise / consent terms even by some of the original plaintiffs,
the learned trial Court is directed to consider all submissions before passing any further order on
the consent terms submitted by some of the plaintiffs and passing consent decree on the basis of
said consent terms. All these questions are kept open and even it will be open for the contesting
respondents also to make submission that qua some of the plaintiffs or all the plaintiffs consent
decree can be passed and all these question are kept open and same are directed to be considered by
learned trial Court before passing any final decree on the basis of consent terms. Rule is made
absolute to the aforesaid extent in each of the Special Civil Applications. There shall be no order as
to costs. Direct service is permitted."
9 Thereafter, the trial court heard and rejected all the applications, namely, applications Exh.30, 26,
25 and 25 for amendment of the plaint in four suits and applications Exh.47, 43, 42 and 41 for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1775566/ 7Appearance vs Patel Lallubhai Ishverbhai ... on 28 April, 2011
recording compromise in the suit. Hence, the present petitions.
10 The respondents herein denied certain factual aspects narrated and so submitted by the learned
counsel for the petitioners and submitted that the original plaintiffs are legal heirs of deceased
Rasiklal Tilakram Jaiswal who died on 23.8.1997 and who was declared as tenant of the suit land
under Section 32(O) of the Act and the order dated 6.7.1979 passed by the Mamlatdar & ALT came
to be confirmed upto the Apex Court. However, the plaintiffs disputed filing of application under
Section 17(O) of the Act being Tenancy Case No.62 of 1994 while Rasiklal Tilakram Jaiswal died on
23.8.1987. However, later on, initially, the Gujarat Revenue Tribunal passed an order on 28.11.2007,
whereby, the Tribunal upheld the order passed by the Deputy Collector, Vadodara and quashed and
set aside the order of the Mamlatdar & ALT dated 4.3.1998 in Tenancy Case No.62 of 1994 and
further held that the land in question was governed by the restriction of Section 43 of the Act. The
above case was admitted and pending in this Court being Special Civil Application No.30703 of
2007 wherein the stay is granted against the impugned order of the Tribunal.
11 Learned counsel for respondent No.5 has made it clear that plaintiff No.5 had withdrawn
compromise and continued to challenge the decision and the proceeding of the civil court as well as
the revenue tribunal to which there is no dispute.
12 Mr.
S.B. Vakil, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioners has submitted that the trial court
has erred in dismissing the applications Exh.30 and 47 and the order passed by the trial court is
contrary to law and there are errors apparent on the face of record and proceeding and, therefore,
such errors are to be corrected by this Court in exercise of power under Articles 226 and 227 of the
Constitution of India. It is further submitted that the trial court has no jurisdiction to dismiss the
application Exh.47 on which the order dated 28.1.2008 was already passed for recording
compromise between the petitioners and respondent Nos. 1 to 4 and 6 to 8. Even Special Civil
Application No.3117 of 2008 filed by respondent No.5 earlier was not entertained by this Court.
Since the above issue of recording compromise between the petitioners and respondent Nos. 1 to 4
and 6 to 8 has already been concluded, the trial court has no jurisdiction to consider or review the
said order and to dismiss the application Exh.47 as a whole. It is further submitted that the trial
court could not have considered the notices and the orders passed in the tenancy cases since the
entire question whether four sale deeds were invalid as contravening Section 43 of the Act was not
concluded and is pending in this Court and the trial court could not have proceeded on the basis that
four sale deeds contravened Section 43 of the Act and were not lawful and should have passed the
decree in terms of the consent terms subject to the outcome of the Special Civil Application pending
in this Court. It is further submitted that the trial court has failed to appreciate the prohibition
contained in Section 43 of the Act which was subject to previous sanction of the Collector and
payment of premium. It is further submitted that the trial court has erred in exercising the
jurisdiction under Order 23 Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure when the parties have entered into
the compromise which was reduced in writing and the prayer was made accordingly. The learned
Senior Advocate for the petitioners has relied upon the decision of the Full Bench of this Court in the
case of Shah Jitendra Nanalal vs. Patel Lallubhai Ishverbhai reported in 1985 GLH 53 and the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1775566/ 8Appearance vs Patel Lallubhai Ishverbhai ... on 28 April, 2011
decision of the Apex Court in the case of Bai Dosabai vs. Mathurdas reported in AIR 1980 SC 1334 in
support of his submission that a conditional decree could have been passed and the conditional
decree is permissible before the sale is actually effected.
12.1 Relying on the decision of the Full Bench of this Court in the case of Shah Jitendra Nanalal
[supra], learned Senior Advocate Mr. S.B. Vakil for the petitioners has submitted that the parties
can enter into a contract for transfer of land and the Court can pass a conditional decree for specific
performance subject to exemption being obtained and in view of what was considered and held
therein, the provisions of section 5(3) and section 20(b)(1) of the Urban Land (Ceiling and
Regulation) Act, 1976 can be applied in the facts of the case and to the transactions which have
taken place under Section 43 of the Bombay Tenancy & Agricultural Lands Act, 1948.
12.2 While referring to the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Bai Dosabai [supra], learned
Senior Advocate Mr. S.B. Vakil has submitted that a contract for the sale of immovable property,
though does not, of itself, create any interest in or charge on such property, creates an obligation
annexed to the ownership of immovable property, not amounting to an interest in the property but
such obligation may be enforced against a transferee with notice of the contract.
12.3 Learned Senior Advocate Mr. S.B. Vakil has relied upon a decision of this Court in the case of
Mavji Dhorji and others vs. State of Gujarat, reported in 1994 (1) GLH 20 to point out the difference
between two expressions 'void' and 'invalid' and submitted that invalid transaction will have to be
invalidated by exercising powers in that respect by the authorities. In the said decision, the learned
Single Judge of this Court referred to the decision of the Division Bench of the Nagpur High Court in
the case of Mohammed Ibrahim Khan Ikramkhan vs. Sugrabi Abdul Rashid and others, reported in
AIR 1955 Nagpur 272.
12.4 Learned Senior Advocate Mr. S.B. Vakil has, in the context of Order 23 Rule 3 of the Code of
Civil Procedure, 1908, relied upon the decision of this Court in the case of Kaluram Bheruji vs. Bai
Parvati, reported in 1982 (1) GLR 201, and submitted that Order 23 Rule 3 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 does not contemplate a situation when the Court can alter the terms of the
compromise and, when the consent terms duly signed by the parties and the respective advocates
was placed on record and the Court has recorded such compromise, a consent decree has to be
passed by the Court.
12.5 In the context of delayed and belated exercise of revisional powers by the Authority in the event
of breach of any statutory provision, learned Senior Advocate Mr. S.B. Vakil has relied upon the
decisions of the Apex Court in the case of Ram Chand vs. Union of India, reported in (1994) 1 SCC
44 and in the case of Mohamad Kavi Mohamad Amin vs. Fatmabai Ibrahim, reported in (1997) 6
SCC 71, and a decision of this Court in the case of Patel Rameshbhai Ramabhai v. State, reported in
2008(3) GLR 2049, and submitted that, where no time-limit is prescribed for exercise of power, it
should be exercised within a reasonable time.
12.6 For the scope of powers to be exercised under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, reliance
is placed by learned Senior Advocate Mr. S.B. Vakil on the decision of the Apex Court in the case of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1775566/ 9Appearance vs Patel Lallubhai Ishverbhai ... on 28 April, 2011
Bajonji Dinshaji Engineer vs. Amy Dhunjisha Gandhi, reported in (1997) 11 SCC 388, to point out
that in the above case exercise of powers by the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of
India in considering other questions relating to the merits which were yet to be considered by the
competent authority in a pending proceeding did not find favour with the Supreme Court.
13 Mr.
B.B. Naik, learned Senior Advocate appearing with Mr. Manav A. Mehta for the petitioners in
Special Civil Application No.9401 of 2009, adopts and reiterates the contentions raised by Mr. S.B.
Vakil, learned Senior Advocate for the petitioners in Special Civil Application Nos. 9400, 9402 and
9403 of 2009.
14. Mr.
D.D. Vyas, learned Senior Advocate for the original plaintiffs [respondent Nos. 1 to 4 and 6 to 8
herein] has submitted that execution of sale deeds as early as in 1992 was contrary to law and even
subsequent execution of four sale deeds was also illegal and barred by law. He has further submitted
that, on the day when the compromise was recorded, all the parties were not present. Besides, in
view of Explanation to Order 23 Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, it is submitted that an
agreement or compromise being void or voidable under the Indian Contract Act, no decree in any
form whether conditional or unconditional could have been passed since the land in question is
governed by the restriction of Section 43 of the Act by which without previous sanction of the
Collector, no agreement with regard to mortgage, transfer, alienation, etc of the land could have
been entered into. It is further submitted that sub-section (2) of Section 43 bars any transfer or
partition and any agreement of transfer or any rent or any interest thereof in contravention of
sub-section (1) or sub-section (1c) of Section 43, shall be invalid and held to be as invalid. It is
further submitted that there are decisions to this effect and reliance is placed on AIR 1993 SC 1139
[Banwari Lal vs. Chando Devi] in respect of Order 23, Rule 1, 3, AIR 1970 Gujarat 204 [Shashikant
vs. State] in respect of the objects of the Act and prohibition of restrictive nature under the Act and
AIR 1996 SC 904 [State of Maharashtra vs. Babu Govind Gavate] in respect of Section 43 of the Act.
14.1 So far as the decision of the Full Bench in the case of Shah Jitendra Nanalal [supra] is
concerned, it is submitted that under the then ULC Act, right to claim exemption under Section 20
of the Act was available to the holder of excess vacant land, while under Section 43(1) of the Act,
rights are restrictive and previous sanction of the Collector is a must before entering into any
agreement of alienating the land in any manner known to law. When previous sanction of the
Collector is a condition precedent, no agreement could have been entered into and sub-section (2) of
section 43 declares such alienation or transfer as invalid and, therefore, the above decision of the
Full Bench of this Court is not applicable to the facts of the present case. The learned counsel for the
plaintiffs has relied upon the decision in the case of Mohammad Ibrahim vs. Sugrabi, reported in
AIR 1955 Nagpur 272 to explain meaning of the words 'void' and 'voidable'.
15. Ms.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1775566/ 10Appearance vs Patel Lallubhai Ishverbhai ... on 28 April, 2011
Megha Jani, learned counsel appearing for respondent No.5 has highlighted the ingredients of
Order 23 Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure and submitted that exercise of powers by the trial
court is not mechanical but it has to consider the compromise carefully and it has to arrive at a
satisfaction about the compromise. It is further submitted that, in view of Explanation to the proviso
to Order 23 Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure and Sections 23 and 24 of the Indian Contract Act,
1872, the agreement itself was forbidden by law in view of operation of Section 43 of the Act and no
decree could have been passed by the trial court on the basis of the order of the Gujarat Revenue
Tribunal dated 28.11.2007, which was stayed by this Court in the writ petition which is pending. It is
further submitted that by virtue of the order of the Gujarat Revenue Tribunal dated 28.11.2007
where a specific declaration was made that the restrictions enumerated in Section 43 are applicable
to the land in question, at the same time, a direction was issued to regularize the transactions which
have taken place between the parties which, ultimately, was stayed by this Court, which is a double
standard. It is further submitted that in the case Shah Jitendra Nanalal [supra] before the Full
Bench, the suit was already instituted prior to ULC Act coming into force and, in view of exemption
available to the land holder of the excess vacant land, it was found by the Full Bench that the valid
agreement was not to be defeated. She has further submitted on the basis of the conduct of the
parties that the consent terms were only filed but they were kept for verification. She has also relied
upon the application dated 17.2.2007 to rescind the terms of the compromise and to deposit the
amount in question in the Court. In support of her submission, she has relied upon AIR 1976
Calcutta 196 [Sm. Sumitra Devi Agarwala vs. Sm. Sulekha Kundu] that no terms can be recorded
contrary to the provisions of the Indian Contract Act in exercise of power under Order 23, Rule 3
and Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure. She has, in the context of Order 23 Rule 3 of the Code
of Civil Procedure, 1908, while relying the decision in the case of Sm. Sumitra Devi Agarwalla
[supra], submitted that the term 'lawful agreement' in Order 23 Rule 3 does not include within it an
agreement which is vitiated by fraud, undue influence or coercion. It excludes such an agreement as
also an agreement which on the face of it is void. She has also relied upon the decision of the Apex
Court in the case of V. Narasimharaju vs. V. Gurumurthy Raju, reported in AIR 1963 SC 107, with
regard to unlawful consideration and submitted that the agreement would be treated as invalid for
the reason that its consideration is opposed to public policy. She has also relied upon the decisions
of the Bombay High Court in the cases of Shri Parshuram Kathod Gaikar vs. Pandu Mahadu Hard,
reported in MANU/MH/0609/1993 and Lotan Ramchandra Shimpi vs. Shankar Ganpat Kayasth,
reported in MANU/MH/0784/1994 and submitted that under Section 43 of the Bombay Tenancy
and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948, previous sanction of the competent authority, namely, Collector,
is required and, if such previous sanction is not obtained, agreement to sell an agricultural land is
invalid and even Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, would not safeguard such
agreement. She has also relied upon the decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of Himatrao
Ukha Mali vs. Popat Devram Patil, reported in AIR 1999 Bombay 10 and submitted that, in the
above case, even the sale deed executed by the tenant was held invalid on the ground that Section 43
of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948, imposes a total prohibition or legal bar on
alienation of the lands vested in favour of the tenants under the said Act. The Court further held
that, if an agreement of sale or any instrument in respect of the subject land is executed without
taking permission of the Collector under Section 43(1), the said agreement will be invalid as per
Section 43(2) of the said Act and the above fact remains undisputed in the facts of this case and,
therefore, the Civil Court has rightly refused to pass a decree in terms of the consent terms
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1775566/ 11Appearance vs Patel Lallubhai Ishverbhai ... on 28 April, 2011
submitted by the parties when plaintiff No.5 filed an application rescinding his consent before the
Court could pass any order. Lastly, it is submitted that since no error is committed by the trial court
while exercising the jurisdiction, this petition must fail under Articles 226 and 227 of the
Constitution of India.
16. In rejoinder, Mr. S.B. Vakil, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioners has reiterated
his submission based on the decision of the Full Bench and further submitted that this Court has
very limited scope under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India and cannot delve into
various factual aspects and submissions made by the learned counsel for the defendants which were
not raised, contended or taken up or not dealt with by the trial court. According to the learned
Senior Counsel, the word 'invalid' appearing in sub-section (2) of section 43 had no bearing on the
sale deeds, which were already executed. Unless the competent authority declares such sale invalid,
the trial court could not have placed reliance on Section 43 of the Act. The trial court could have
addressed to the questions, whether sale deeds were invalid and/or whether compromise was
invalid under Section 43 of the Act or under the Indian Contract Act and decree could have been
drawn and also about the consideration of sale money already paid which was approximately Rs.37
lakhs to each of the parties-plaintiffs herein and accepted by them. Further, in rejoinder, learned
Senior Advocate Mr. S.B. Vakil has distinguished the decision relied upon by learned Senior
Advocate Mr. D.D. Vyas, in the case of Shashikant Mohanlal Desai [supra] [AIR 1970 Gujarat 204],
interpreting Section 43 of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948, and submitted
that the transfer may be made by the tenant to another after sanction by the Collector and on
payment of such amount as the State Government may by general or special order determine and if
either of these two conditions is not fulfilled, the transfer would be invalid and, therefore, if the
agreement is entered into for transfer of land subject to availing sanction of the Collector by itself
cannot be said to be invalid unless so declared by the Competent Authority. On the basis of such
agreement and an application preferred by the tenant for removal of restriction under Section 43,
the Collector would see various circumstances relating to the proposed transfer and decide whether
he should grant sanction or not and, if the sanction is granted by the Collector on a condition of
making payment as provided and called as premium, the land shall stand transferred, but the
agreement entered into between the parties to transfer such land before the sanction cannot be said
to be invalid.
16.1 Similarly, with regard to the decision relied upon by learned Senior Advocate Mr. D.D. Vyas, in
the case of Banwari Lal [supra] [AIR 1993 SC 1139], learned Senior Advocate Mr. S.B. Vakil
submitted that, in view of proviso read with Explanation to Rule 3 of Order 23, a Court which had
entertained the petition of compromise has to examine whether compromise was void or voidable
under the Indian Contract Act and this aspect was completely overlooked by the Court below and,
therefore, the order impugned deserves to be quashed and set aside.
17. In sur-rejoinder, learned Senior Advocate Mr. D.D. Vyas has relied upon the decision of the Apex
Court in the case of Jayamma vs. Maria Bai, reported in AIR 2004 SC 3957 and submitted that when
an assignment or transfer is made in contravention of statutory provisions, the consequence
whereof would be that the same is invalid and, thus, being opposed to public policy, the same shall
attract the provisions of Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act and, in the facts of the present case,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1775566/ 12Appearance vs Patel Lallubhai Ishverbhai ... on 28 April, 2011
the agreement to transfer/alienate/sell the land in question was barred by Section 43 of the Bombay
Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948, and, therefore, no error of law much less of jurisdiction
is committed by the Civil Court warranting interference of this Court in extraordinary jurisdiction
under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
18. To appreciate the rival contentions of the parties, it is necessary to advert to the relevant
provisions of the Code and the Act and the observations made by the Civil Court in the order
impugnd.
18.1 Order XXIII of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 reads as under:
"1. Withdrawal of suit or abandonment of part of claim:
(1) At any time after the institution of a suit, the plaintiff may as against all or any of the defendants
abandon his suit or abandon a part of his claim:
Provided that where the plaintiff is a minor or other person to whom the provisions contained in

without the leave of the Court.
(2) An application for leave under the proviso to sub-rule (1) shall be accompanied by an affidavit of
the next friend and also, if the minor or such other person is represented by a pleader, by a

fresh suit in respect of such subject matter or such part of the claim.
(5) Nothing in this rule shall be deemed to authorize the Court to permit one of several plaintiffs to
abandon a suit or part of a claim under sub-rule (1), or to withdraw, under sub-rule (3), any suit or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1775566/ 13Appearance vs Patel Lallubhai Ishverbhai ... on 28 April, 2011
part of a claim, without the consent of other plaintiffs.
1-A When transposition of the defendants as plaintiffs may be permitted.
Where a suit is withdrawn or abandoned by a plaintiff under rule 1, and a defendant applies to be
transposed as a plaintiff under rule 10 or Order I, the Court shall, in considering such application,
have due regard to the question whether the applicant has a substantial question to be decided as
against any of the other defendants.
2. Limitation law not affected by first suit.-
In any fresh suit instituted on permission granted under the last preceding rule, the plaintiff shall be
bound by the law of limitation in the same manner as if the first suit has not been instituted.
3. Compromise of suit.-
Where it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that a suit has been adjusted wholly or in part by
any lawful agreement or compromise in writing and signed by the parties, or where the defendant
satisfies the plaintiff in respect of the whole or any part of the subject matter of the suit, the Court
shall order such agreement, compromise or satisfaction to be recorded, and shall pass a decree in
accordance therewith so far as it relates to the parties to the suit, whether or not the subject matter
of the agreement, compromise or satisfaction is the same as the subject matter of the suit:
Provided that where it is alleged by one party and denied by the other that any adjustment or
satisfaction has been arrived at, the Court shall decide the question; but no adjournment shall be
granted for the purpose of deciding the question, unless the Court, for the reason to be recorded,
thinks fit to grant such adjournment.
Explanation.- An agreement or compromise which is void or voidable under the Indian Contract
Act, 1872 (9 of 1872) shall not be deemed to be lawful within the meaning of this rule.
3-A Bar to suit.-
No suit shall lie to set aside a decree on the ground that the compromise on which the decree is
based was not lawful.
3-B No agreement or compromise to be entered in a representative suit without leave of the Court.
(1) No agreement or compromise in a representative suit shall be entered into without the leave of
the Court expressly recorded the proceedings; and any such agreement or compromise entered into
without the leave of the Court so recorded shall be void.
(2) Before granting such leave, the Court shall give notice in such manner as it may think fit to such
persons as may appear to it to be interested in the suit.

Explanation.-
In this rule, 'representative suit' means,-
(a) a suit under section 91 or section 92
(b) a suit under rule 8 or Order I,
(c) a suit in which the manager of an undivided Hindu family sues or is sued as representing the
other members of the family,

other law for the time being in force, bind any person who is not named as party to the suit.
4. Proceedings in execution of decrees not affected.-
Nothing in this Order shall apply to any proceedings in execution of a decree or order.
18.2 Section 43 of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948, reads as under:
"43. Restriction on transfer of land purchased or sold under this Act.
No land or any interest therein purchased by a tenant under Section 17B, 32, 32F, 32-I, 32U or
43.ID, or sold to any person under Section 32P or 64 shall be transferred or shall be agreed by an
instrument in writing to be transferred, by sale, gift, exchange, mortgage, lease or assignment,
without the previous sanction of the Collector and except in consideration of payment of such
amount as the State Government may by general or special order determine; and no such land or
any interest, therein, shall be partitioned without the previous sanction of the Collector.
Provided that no previous sanction of the Collector shall be required, if the partition of the land is
among the members of the family who have direct blood relation or among the legal heirs of the
tenant.
Provided further that the partition of the land as aforesaid shall not be valid if it is made in
contravention of the provisions of any other law for the time being in force:
Provided also that such members of the family or the legal heirs shall hold tenant, after the
partition, on the same terms, conditions and restrictions as were applicable to such land or interest
therest therein purchased by the tenant or the person.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1775566/ 15Appearance vs Patel Lallubhai Ishverbhai ... on 28 April, 2011
(1AA) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), it shall be lawful for such tenant or a
person to mortgage or create a charge on his interests in the land in favour of the State Government
in consideration of a loan advanced to him by the State Government under the Land Improvement
Loans Act, 1884, the Agriculturists' Loan Act, 1884, or the Bombay Non- agriculturists' Loans act,
1928, as in force in the State of Gujarat, or in favour of a bank or cooperative society, and without
prejudice to any other remedy open to the State Government, bank or cooperative society, as the
case may be, in the event of his making default in payment of such loan in accordance with the terms
on which such loan was granted, it shall be lawful for the State Government, bank or cooperative
society, as the case may be, to cause his interest in the land to be attached and sold and the proceeds
to be applied in payment of such loan.
Explanation:
xx xx (1B) Nothing in sub-section (1) or (1AA) shall apply to land purchased under section 32, 32F or
64 by a permanent tenant thereof, if prior to the purchase, the permanent tenant, by usage, custom,
agreement or decree or order of a court, held a transferable right in the tenancy of the land.
2. Any transfer or partition, or any agreement of transfer, or any land or any interest therein in
contravention of sub- section (1) shall be invalid"
18.3 The observations made by the trial court in paragraph 40 of the order impugned, translated
into English, read as under:
"40.Considering the submissions of the plaintiffs and the defendants, the plaintiffs and defendant
No.2 have filed consent terms. Plaintiff No.5 took objection to the said consent terms. Applications
have been filed on behalf of defendants Nos. 2 to 7 to the effect that the consent
terms/settlement/agreement qua plaintiff Nos. 1 to 4 and 6 to 8, except plaintiff No.5, be recorded
and a decree be passed. On behalf of the plaintiffs, it has been submitted that the consent terms is
contrary to law. On behalf of the defendants, it has been stated that as the consent terms is in
accordance with law and the plaintiffs have accepted the amount of consideration as per the consent
terms, decree be passed. Permission has been sought for modification deleting the names of
defendants Nos. 1, 8 and 9. On behalf of plaintiff No.5, it has been submitted to proceed with the
suit since he is not agreeable to the consent terms. As the High Court of Gujarat has directed to take
further action in connection with the consent terms entered into between the parties, on behalf of
other plaintiffs also, it has been submitted that the consent terms is illegal. It has been contended on
behalf of defendants Nos. 1 to 4 and 6 to 8 that the consent terms has been got executed by fraud,
but such contention is not believable. The parties have produced the agreement, which has been
signed by them voluntarily and all the plaintiffs have also made a declaration before the Notary
regarding the consent terms, therefore, the story of fraud is not believable. It is to be seen whether
the said consent terms, which has been produced before the Court in all the four suits, is legal or
not. The lands of four suits are tenancy lands. The father of the plaintiffs has been declared to be a
tenant, therefore, the same is restricted land as per Section 43 of the Tenancy Act. Against the order
passed by the Revenue Tribunal, the Gujarat High Court has granted stay. Thus, as the dispute with
regard to all the suit lands is going on and that the consent terms, which has been produced, is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1775566/ 16Appearance vs Patel Lallubhai Ishverbhai ... on 28 April, 2011
signed voluntarily and with consent, the decree cannot be passed under Order 23 Rule 3 of the CPC
on the basis of the said consent terms because the lands referred to in the settlement are disputed
lands under the Tenancy Act. Agreement, which is void and voidable under the Indian Contract Act,
cannot be said to be an agreement in accordance with law. Therefore, considering the judgments
cited on behalf of the plaintiffs, since the settlement is contrary to law, decree cannot be passed. As
per the judgments cited on behalf of the defendants, if the agreement is in accordance with law,
objection taken by any party thereafter will not be tenable. The agreement, which has been produced
in the present four suits, pertains to restricted land under Section 43 of the Tenancy Act. Therefore,
as the lands are restricted land under Section 43 and tenancy dispute is going on and as the
agreement is not lawful, decree cannot be passed as per the agreement. Therefore, applications
Exh.30 in Special Civil Suit No.391 of 2001, Exh.26 in Special Civil Suit No.392 of 2001, Exh.25 in
Special Civil Suit No.393 of 2001, Exh.30 in Special Civil Suit No.394 of 2001, for deleting names of
defendants Nos. 1, 8 and 9 as party-defendants cannot be allowed. Further, as the agreements in all
suits are not legal and lawful, applications Exh.47 in Special Civil Suit No.391 of 2001, Exh.43 in
Special Civil Suit No.392 of 2001, Exh.41 in Special Civil Suit No.393 of 2001 and Special Civil Suit
No.394 of 2001 filed by defendants Nos. 2 to 7 requesting for passing a decree in accordance with
consent terms/agreement cannot be allowed in as much as no such decree can be passed as the
agreements are illegal, therefore, following final order is passed.
ORDER
41. Applications Exh.30 and 43 in Special Civil Suit No.391 of 2001, Exh.26 and 43 in Special Civil
Suit No.392 of 2001, Exh.25 and 42 in Special Civil Suit No.393 of 2001, Exh.25 and 41 in Special
Civil Suit No.394 of 2001, are rejected."
19. The above paragraph 40 of the order impugned passed by the learned Judge takes note of the
consent terms produced on record between the plaintiffs and defendant No.2 and objection to the
said consent terms raised by plaintiff No.5. In addition to the above, the learned Judge has further
noticed the fact about grant of stay by the High Court to the order passed by the Gujarat Revenue
Tribunal by which the Tribunal had given certain directions to regularize the transaction which had
taken place between the parties on payment of an amount of premium. Even the contention of the
plaintiffs about execution of the consent terms by fraud is not believed on the ground that the
consideration was paid and it was signed by the plaintiffs voluntarily and a declaration was also
made before a Notary. Thereafter, the nature of the consent terms was also examined by the learned
Judge in the context of Section 43 of the Tenancy Act whether a decree could be passed under Order
XXIII Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure. While examining the above aspects, the learned Judge
has also found that the subject land was restricted land under section 43 of the Tenancy Act and,
therefore, the agreement was not lawful and any agreement whether void and/or voidable under the
Indian Contract Act for which recourse cannot be taken to Order XXIII Rule 3 of the Code of Civil
Procedure and the above view and reasoning of the learned Judge cannot be said to be contrary to
law or illegal in any manner since Explanation to proviso to Order XXIII Rule 3 of the Code of Civil
Procedure clearly provides that the agreement or compromise which is void or voidable under the
Indian Contract Act, 1872, shall not be deemed to be lawful within the meaning of this Rule. Thus, if
the above Explanation to proviso to Order XXIII Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure is construed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1775566/ 17Appearance vs Patel Lallubhai Ishverbhai ... on 28 April, 2011
in juxtaposition to Sections 23 and 24 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, it defines unlawful
contract/agreement forbidden by law and, therefore, when, admittedly, subject land of the consent
terms is 'restrictive tenure land' and governed by the restriction imposed under section 43 of the
Tenancy Act, viz. 'without previous sanction of the Collector, no such land shall be
alienated/transferred', rejection of the prayer to draw a decree in terms of the consent
terms/agreement forbidden by law as above cannot be said to be illegal, which deserves any
interference by this Court in exercise of the jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of
India. The Trial Court has neither failed to exercise jurisdiction nor illegally exercised jurisdiction
warranting any interference at the hands of this Court in exercise of extraordinary jurisdiction.
20. The decision of the Full Bench of this Court in the case of Shah Jitendra Nanalal {1985 GLH 53}
[supra], relied upon by learned Senior Advocate Mr. S.B. Vakil for the petitioners, was in a different
context and under the statutory provisions of Urban Land [Ceiling and Regulation] Act,1976
whether right to claim exemption under section 20 of the ULC Act was available to the holder of the
excess vacant land. In the above decision, agreement to sell certain land was executed on 4.7.1966
and further agreement was entered into on 1.7.1967 and the civil suit, being Civil Suit No.1915 of
1970, was filed while another suit filed by the defendants as the plaintiffs being Civil Suit No.2063 of
1969 was compromised between the parties thereto and, on the basis of the settlement, a decree was
passed on 5.7.1972. Subsequent to institution of the suit, Gujarat Vacant Lands in Urban Areas
[Prohibition of Alienation] Act,1972 came into force which later on ceased to operate in its place on
the advent of Urban Land [Ceiling and Regulation] Act, 1976. Further, right to claim exemption by
the owner of the land under the ULC Act continued until vesting under section 10(3) of the ULC Act
and, therefore, a conditional decree for specific performance subject to exemption being obtained
under section 20 of the ULC Act was held to be permissible. In the facts of the case,
transfer/alienation of tenure land viz. a land given to a tenant by the Government under various
provisions of Tenancy Act to the tiller of the land, subject to restriction of Section 43 of the Act, is
clearly impermissible without previous sanction of the Collector/Competent Authority, therefore,
the law laid down by the Full Bench in Jitendra Nanalal [supra] is not applicable to the facts and
circumstances of the present case.
21. In the scenario of factual and legal aspects of the present case, I am in respectful agreement with
law laid down in the decisions relied upon by Mr. D.D. Vyas and Ms. Megha Jani, learned counsel
appearing for respondent Nos. 1 to 4 and 6 to 8 and respondent No.5, respectively.
22. In the case of V. Narasimharaju (AIR 1963 SC 107) [supra], the Apex Court held with regard to
unlawful consideration that the agreement would be treated as invalid for the reason that such
consideration is opposed to public policy and particularly when previous sanction of the Collector
was a mandatory and, admittedly, such previous sanction was not obtained by the parties and the
agreement to sell an agricultural land is invalid and even Section 53A of the Transfer of Property
Act, 1882 would also not safeguard such agreement. The above aspect is also dealt with by the
Bombay High Court in the case of Himatrao Ukha Mali vs. Popat Devram Patil, AIR 1999 Bombay
10, [supra], wherein it is held that Section 43 imposes a total prohibition or legal bar on alienation
of the lands vested in favour of the tenants under the provisions of the Tenancy Act. If an agreement
of sale or any instrument in respect of the subject land is executed without taking previous sanction
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1775566/ 18Appearance vs Patel Lallubhai Ishverbhai ... on 28 April, 2011
of the Collector under section 43(1) of the Tenancy Act, the said agreement shall be invalid as per
Section 43(2) of the said Act. Suffice it to say that Section 43(1) of the Tenancy Act bars even
entering into agreement or alienating the land and usage of term 'shall' twice in the section
including in the penultimate part of the section reveals mandatory character of the language
contained therein and to be interpreted as such and, particularly when the agreement/transaction
was barred by sub-section (1) of Section 43 of the Tenancy Act and sub-section (2) of Section 43 of
the said Act clearly refers such agreement or transfer shall be invalid, the trial court has rightly
concluded by not probing into the question of declaration of such transaction/agreement as invalid.
The satisfaction of the learned Judge based on the understanding of the language contained in
sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 43 of the Tenancy Act and the relevant materials on record of the
case for not passing the decree as prayed for cannot be said to be in any manner contrary to law
warranting any interference by this Court in exercise of powers under Articles 226 and 227 of the
Constitution of India.
23. Besides, all the parties to the compromise were not ad-idem. Here, in the instant case, plaintiff
No.5 had not agreed and rescinded the contract. Since plaintiff No.5 specifically filed an application
rescinding his consent even before the Court could pass any order, the payment of consideration as
reflected in the consent terms by itself was not a ground for the learned Judge to consider the
agreement lawful warranting to pass a decree as sought for. Before the learned Judge could pass the
final order, all the plaintiffs had expressly withdrawn their consent. Thus, the contention of learned
Senior Advocate Mr. S.B. Vakil for the petitioners that the Court which had entertained petition for
compromise has to examine whether the compromise was void or voidable under the Indian
Contract Act has no substance because, in the facts of the case and on perusal of the order passed by
the learned Judge including the paragraph 40, it did not reveal that the learned Judge has failed to
examine such issue in any manner. In the instant case, the learned Judge had given a finding in
favour of the petitioners that the sale was voluntary and consideration was paid - that itself is
indicative of the fact that the learned Judge has considered all relevant aspects and applied his
mind. A question about recording of compromise and rejecting applications for passing a decree in
terms of compromise are two different facets of the procedure and even if the compromise is
recorded, it is not obligatory upon the learned Judge to pass a decree in terms of such compromise
or request made and, in the facts of the case, the learned Judge has considered the above
compromise in context of Section 43 of the Tenancy Act vis-a-vis Order 23 Rule 3 of the Code and
proviso and explanation therein and, therefore, it cannot be said that the trial court has no
jurisdiction to dismiss the applications under Section 43 of the Tenancy Act, warranting exercise of
power by this Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
24. Further, the Division Bench of this Court considered spectrum of Section 43 of the Tenancy Act
in the case of Shashikant Mohanlal Desai {AIR 1970 Gujarat 204} [supra] and examined the objects
of the Act and while interpreting Section 43 of the Tenancy Act the restrictive nature of tenancy and
specific bar contained about previous sanction of the Collector/Competent Authority in case of
conversion of such land was held to be statutory and, therefore, according to this Court, the learned
Judge has not committed any error either of jurisdiction or of law in considering the nature of
agreement whether void or voidable and, therefore, no interference is called for. Further, the
learned Judge has taken into consideration all the aspects of the matter as directed by this Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1775566/ 19Appearance vs Patel Lallubhai Ishverbhai ... on 28 April, 2011
[Coram: M.R. Shah, J.] vide judgment and order dated 22.8.2008 in Special Civil Application Nos.
3117 to 3120 of 2008 and passed the order, which cannot be said to be contrary to said order dated
22.8.2008.
25. The law laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Banwari Lal [AIR 1993 SC 1139] (supra)
about the proposition that, in view of the proviso read with Explanation of Order 23, Rule 3, a Court
which had entertained the petition for compromise, has to examine whether the compromise was
'valid or invalid' or 'void or voidable' under the Indian Contract Act, is considered by the learned
Judge and, in the context of clear language in Section 43 of the Tenancy Act, which prohibited
alienation of land restricted by operation of Section 43 of the said Act without previous sanction of
the Competent Authority/Collector, the order impugned cannot be said to be illegal.
26 In the case of Lotan Ramchandra Shimpi [Manu/MH/0784/1994] {supra}, it is held that,
without sanction under Section 43 of the Tenancy Act, the impugned agreement is invalid and
possession given to the purchaser is invalid and the same is not protected under Section 53A of the
Transfer of Property Act.
27. Keeping in mind the law laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Bajonji Dinshaji Engineer
[(1997) 11 SCC 388] {supra}, it is not open for this Court to consider other questions relating to the
merits of the matter in as much as this Court is satisfied with the sound judicial discretion exercised
by the learned Judge in refusing to pass a decree of compromise as prayed for. The question about
the bar on exercising revisional power by the Authority after a delay of more than reasonable period
is a question not to be gone into at this stage and suffice it to say that the High Court stayed the
direction of the Gujarat Revenue Tribunal to consider the case for regularization of
deal/agreement/transaction between the parties upon the payment of premium and the matter is
sub-judice. So is the case about the decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the parties
about the difference between two expressions 'void and voidable' and 'valid and invalid' contract. No
further discussion is required at this stage on the above issue in view of the finding recorded by the
learned Judge about the agreement being unlawful barred by Section 43 of the Tenancy Act,
therefore, covered under proviso read with explanation to Order 13 Rule 3 of the Code of Civil
Procedure and the Indian Contract Act and the land was given to a tenant by the State Government
by virtue of operation of various provisions of the Tenancy Act and keeping in mind the objects and
reasons of the Tenancy Act and the intention of the Legislature in making the tenant a 'deemed
purchaser' and applying restrictions about transfer of such land as interpreted by the Division Bench
of this Court in the case Shashikant Mohanlal Desai, {AIR 1970 Gujarat 204} (supra), in my view, no
error appears on the face of the order impugned with regard to exercise of jurisdiction by the Civil
Court or deciding the prayer of the petitioners herein to pass a decree under Order 23 Rule 3.
28. The other decisions relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners are not
applicable to the facts of the present case.
29. In the result, all the four petitions deserve to be dismissed and are hereby dismissed accordingly.
Rule is discharged in each of the petitions. The interim relief stands vacated. There shall be no order
as to costs.
