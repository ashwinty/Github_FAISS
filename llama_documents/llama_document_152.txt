JUDGMENT
Bhagwati, J.
(1) This Reference raises a question of vires of Section 26(3) of the Bombay Sales Tax Act,1953. The
section has been challenged as beyond the legislative competence of the State Legislature on the
ground that it purports to tax a transaction which is not a sale, by treating it as a sale. In order to
appreciate how the question arises, it is necessary to state briefly the facts giving rise to the
Reference. The opponents were until 27th November 1956, a partnership firm, and the firm carried
on business as a dealer in mill stores. The firm was registered as a dealer under the Act and held
Registration Certificate No.10-C-198. Quarterly returns of turnover of its sales were filed by the firm
from time to time as required by the Act and the Rules framed under the Act. on the death of one of
the partners, the firm was dissolved on 27th November 1956, but the surviving partners continued
to submit quarterly returns in the name of the firm until 31st March 1957, since certain goods
indented by the firms before dissolution were received in March 1957 after dissolution. The goods of
the firm which remained after paying off the debts and liabilities of the firm and taking accounts
between the parties, were distributed in specie amongst the surviving partners and the
representatives of the deceased partner and this fact was recorded in a Deed of Dissolution dated
27th July 1957. The Sales Tax Officer, Licence Circle, Ahmedabad, by an order dated 23rd April
1958, assessed the firm to sales tax for the period 1str April 1956 to 31st March 1957 and in such
assessment included the goods of the firm valued at Rs.94,861/- which were distributed in specie
amongst the partners on dissolution of the firm. This he did under Section 26(3) of the Act on the
ground that the goods were allotted to the partners and were, therefore, liable to be taxed as if they
were sold to the partners. Against the decision of the Sales Tax Officer, the firm preferred an appeal
to the Assistant Collector of Sales Tax followed, but the appeal failed. A Revision Application to the
Additional Collector of Sales Tax followed, but that was also rejected. the firm thereupon carried the
matter in revision before the Tribunal. Two contentions were urged before the Tribunal in support
of the Revision Application of which one turned on the interpretation of Section 26(3) and the other
related to the vires of the Section. The Tribunal accepted the first contention and held that the
allotment of the goods of the firm to the partners on dissolution was undoubtedly treated by the
fiction of law created by the Section as a sale, but the fiction merely clothed the allotment with the
characteristics of a sale simplicities and did not extend to make it a sale in the course of business.
The Tribunal observed that only sales effected by a dealer in the course of business were liable to be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1250550/ 1State Of Gujarat vs Ramanlal Sankalchand And Co. on 8 November, 1963
included in the turnover of sales chargeable to tax and since the allotment of the goods of the firm
amongst the partners though fictionally regarded as a sale was not a sale in the course of business, it
was not includible in the turnover of sales and the machinery of assessment set out in Section 14
was, therefore, inapplicable to the assessment to tax on such allotment treated as a sale under
Section 26(3). In this view of matter, the Tribunal did not think it necessary to consider the second
contention which attacked the vires of Section 26(3). The Tribunal in the result allowed the Revision
Application and set aside the assessment in so far as it assessed to tax the goods of the firm
apportioned amongst the partners on dissolution. The State thereupon applied to the Tribunal for a
reference under Section 34 and since questions of law admittedly arose out of its order, the Tribunal
referred the following questions of law for the opinion of the Court:
"1.Whether the goods allotted to any partner of a firm on the dissolution thereof are
goods sold to such partner by the firm and can be included in the turnover of sales of
the firm?
2. Whether the provisions of Section 14 of the Bombay Sales Tax Act 1953, are
applicable to the assessment of the tax liable to be paid under Section 26 (3) of the
Act?"
It may be pointed out that though the State did in the first instance ask for a Reference of the first
question, at the hearing of the Reference Applications the State did not press it and confined its
application only to second question. The firm, however, insisted that the first question should also
be referred since it arose out of the order of the Tribunal and the Tribunal accordingly referred both
the questions to this Court.
(2) We will first take up for consideration the second question which arose directly out of the
contention which found favour with the Tribunal, for it can be disposed of in a few words. As a
matter of fact Mr.K.H.Kaji, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the firm, found it difficult to
sustain the order of the Tribunal on that ground and be fairly conceded that it was not possible to
argue that the allotment of goods amongst the partners on the dissolution of a firm was under the
fiction created by Section 26(3) a sale simpliciter and not a sale in the course of business and was,
therefore, not liable to be included in the turnover of sales and the machinery of assessment set out
in Section 14 was consequently not applicable to the assessment of tax on such allotment under
Section 26(3). The argument was obviously unsustainable because it ignored the basic principle
which requires that when a statute enacts that something shall be deemed to have been done which
in fact and truth was not done, the Court is entitled and bound to ascertain for what purpose and
between what persons the statutory fiction is to be resorted to and full effect must be given to the
statutory fiction and it should be carried to its logical conclusion. Vide State of Bombay v.
Pandurang, AIR 1953 SC 244. As observed by Lord Asquith of Bishopstone in East End Dwelling Co.
Ltd v. Finsbury Borough Council, 1952 AC 109:
"If you are bidden to treat an imaginery state of affairs as real, you must surely,
unless prohibited from doing so, also imagine as real the consequences and incidents
which, if the putative state of affairs had in fact existed, must inevitably have flowed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1250550/ 2State Of Gujarat vs Ramanlal Sankalchand And Co. on 8 November, 1963
from or accompanied it ... The statute says that you must imagine a certain state of
affairs; it does not say that having done so, you must cause or permit your
imaginations to boggle when it comes to the inevitable corollaries of that state of
affairs".
The argument on which the Tribunal decided against the State seeks to do that which Lord Asquith
of Bishopstone said that you should not do when a legal fiction is created. If section 26(3) creates a
legal fiction requiring allotment of goods to a partner on dissolution of a firm to be treated as a sale
to such partner for the purpose of taxation, full effect must be given that legal fiction and it must be
carried to its logical conclusion and just as any actual sale effected by the firm would have been a
sale in the course of business, so also the fictional sale must be regarded a sale must be regarded a
sale in the course of business for the purpose of taxation. The distinction which the Tribunal made
between a simpliciter and a sale in course of business was entirely unwarranted and in making such
distinction the Tribunal failed to give full effect to the legal fiction created in Section 26(3). If
Section 26(3) was a valid piece of legislation, it had clearly the effect of converting allotment of
goods of the firm amongst the partners on dissolution into sale for all purpose of taxation and such
allotment was liable to be included in the taxable turnover of the firm.
(3) That takes us to the first question which was the question really debated before us. This question
raised the point of vires of Section 26(3) in the following manner. The controversy between the
parties was whether the goods allotted to a partner of a firm on dissolution could be said to be goods
sold to such partner by the firm and were liable to be included in the turnover of sales of the form.
The States insisted that such allotment constituted a sale of goods by the firm to the partner and
were, therefore, includible in the turnover of sales of the firm and relied on Sec.26 (3) in support of
this proposition. Now prima facie, having regard to Section 26 (3) it would appear that the question
must be answered in favour of the State but, said Mr.K.H.Kaji, Section 26(3) was beyond the
legislative competence of the State Legislature and was ultra vires and the State was, therefore, not
entitled to rely on it for the purpose of upholding the validity of the assessment. He contended that
the power of the Legislature to tax sales on goods was derived from Entry 54 in List II of the Seventh
Schedule to the Constitution which at the time when Section 26(3) was enacted, was in the following
terms, namely, "Taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other than newspapers" and the expression
"sale of goods" in this Entry had the same meaning as sale of goods in the Indian Sale of Goods Act
and the State Legislature was consequently not entitled to make any law levying tax on transactions
which were not of the nature of sale of goods within the meaning of the Indian Sale of Goods Act. the
argument was that the allotment of goods of the firm on dissolution amongst the partners was not a
sale within the meaning of the Indian Sale of Goods Act and the State Legislature had, therefore, by
enacting Section 26(3) purported to tax a transaction which was not a sale by fictionally treating it
as a sale. This, contended Mr.K.H.Kaji, was not constitutionally permissible to the State Legislature
and Section 26(3) was, therefore, ultra vires and could not be relied upon by the State for the
purpose of taxing such allotment.
(4) The learned Advocate General agreed that the power of the State Legislature to legislate with
respect of tax on sale of goods was to be found in Entry 54 and that the validity of Section 26(3)
would, therefore, have to be tested by reference to the true import of that Entry but he contended
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1250550/ 3State Of Gujarat vs Ramanlal Sankalchand And Co. on 8 November, 1963
that the Section was within the legislative power of the State Legislature as contained in that Entry.
He sought to support the validity of Section 26(3) first upon the ground that the matter of that
Section was within the subject "Taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other than newspapers"
expressly mentioned in Entry 54 since the allotment of goods to partners on dissolution of a firm
amounted to sale of goods within the meaning of that expression as used in that Entry and secondly
upon the ground that Section 26(3) constituted an exercise of legislative power on a matter ancillary
or subsidiary to the primary and main power connoted by the expression "Taxes on the sale or
purchase of goods other than newspapers" and contained a provision necessarily incidental to
effective legislation on the subject.
(5) These contentions raised a question as to the true scope and ambit of the legislative power of the
State Legislature under Entry 54. Now in order to arrive at a proper determination of this question it
is necessary to bear in mind the well settled rule of interpretation that in construing words in a
constitutional enactment conferring legislative power, the most liberal construction must be put
upon the words so that the same may have effect in their widest amplitude. While considering the
scope of the various entries in the Legislative Lists, the widest possible amplitude must be given to
the words used and as stated by Sir Maurice Gwyer, C.J. in United Provinces v. Mt. Atiqa Begum,
AIR 1941 FC 16 "each general word should be held to extent to all ancillary or subsidiary matters
which can fairly and reasonably be said to be comprehended in it." When legislative power is
conferred on a Legislature to legislate with regard to a particular topic of legislation, the Legislature
must necessarily also have power to legislate on all matters which are ancillary or subsidiary to the
main subject for otherwise it may not be possible to have effective legislation on the subject. Vide
Edward Mills Co.Ltd. v. State of Ajmer, (1955) I SCR 735: ((S) AIR 1955 SC 25) and State of
Rajasthan v. G. Chawla, AIR 1959 SC 544. The preposition is, therefore, now well established and
beyond controversy that the Legislature has power to legislate not only on a subject matter which
falls directly within the subject of the legislative entry but also on a subject matter which may be
ancillary or subsidiary to such subject, for otherwise much of the legislation would be rendered
ineffective on the ground that provisions which are necessarily incidental to effective legislation on
the subject expressly within the power of the Legislature cannot be made by the Legislature on the
ground that they fall outside the legislative entry. It is for this reasons that the Supreme Court said
in Chaturbhai v. Union of India, AIR 1960 SC 424 that---
"It is within the competence of the Central Government Legislature to provide for the
matters which may otherwise fall within the competence of the provincial legislature
if they are necessarily incidental to effective legislation by the Central Legislature on
a subject of legislation expressly within its power".
In every case, therefore, where a provision in an enactment is challenged as beyond the legislative
competence of the Legislature, the first question that must be considered is whether the provision
falls within the express words of the entry conferring power on the Legislature which enacted the
legislation. If it falls directly within the subject of legislation, cadit questio. But even if it does not so
fall, its validity can yet be sustained on the ground that it reflects an exercise of legislative power on
ancillary or subsidiary matter which can fairly and reasonably be regarded as comprehended within
the subject of legislation and contains a provision necessarily incidental to effective legislation on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1250550/ 4State Of Gujarat vs Ramanlal Sankalchand And Co. on 8 November, 1963
the subject of legislation. The question which we have, therefore, to consider for the purpose of
deciding the validity of Section 26(3) is a two-fold one. Firstly, does the subject matter of Section
26(3) fall within the subject of legislation set out in Entry 54? And secondly, if it does not can it be
said that Section 26(3) constitutes legislation on an ancillary or subsidiary matter necessarily
incidental to effective legislation on the subject of legislative contained in the Entry.
(6) Turning to the first question it is clear that the answer to it must depend on the true meaning to
be given to the expression "sale of Goods" in Entry 54. Now what is the true connotation of this
expression as used in this Entry is no longer a question open to controversy. It is settled by the
decision of the Supreme Court in State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley and Co., (1958) 9 STC 353:
(AIR 1958 SC 560). The question which arose in that case was in regard to the vires of certain
provisions of the Madras General Sales Tax Act,1939 as amended by the Madras Sales Tax
(Amendment) Act, 1947,which sought to tax the supply of materials involved in execution of a works
contract treating it as a sale of goods by the contractor. The vires was challenged on the ground that
the provisions were beyond the legislative power of the State Legislature under Entry 48 in List II of
Schedule VII to the Government of India Act 1935,being the Constitution in force at the date when
the provisions were enacted. The Supreme Court was, therefore, called upon to determine the scope
and ambit of this Entry which was in the same terms as Entry 54 with which we are concerned in the
present case. The Supreme Court held that the expression "sale of goods" in this Entry had the same
meaning as it had under the Indian Sale of Goods Act and that the State Legislature was, therefore,
entitled to legislate with respect to levy of tax only in respect of those transaction which constituted
sale of gods within the meaning of the Indian Sale of Goods Act and was not entitled in exercise of
its legislative power under that Entry to levy tax on transaction which did not constitute such sales.
The Supreme Court the n examined the question as to what constituted sale of goods with in the
meaning of the Indian Sale of Goods Act and said that in order to constitute such sale it was
necessary that three elements should exist in a transaction: first, there should be an agreement
between the parties for the purpose of transferring title to goods; secondly, property must actually
pass in the goods under the agreement; and thirdly, there must be money consideration for the
transfer of property in the goods. If any one of these elements is absent, the transaction would not
be a sale within the meaning of the Indian Sale of Goods Act. after formulating these characteristics
of sale as defined in the Indian Sale of Goods Act the Supreme Court proceeded to consider whether
these characteristics were present in a works contract in so far as the supply of materials under it
was concerned and whether it could be said that there was a sale of the materials which went to
make up the work. The Supreme Court found that two characteristics of sale were being absent in a
works Contract. The first characteristic which did not exist in a works contract was that there was no
agreement to sell the materials as such and the second characteristic absent in such a contract was
that the property in the materials did not pass as movables. In this view of the matter the Supreme
Court held that there was no sale of materials involved in the execution of a works contract. It was,
however, made clear that if the works contract was not one indivisible works contract but there were
two agreements, one for the supply of materials and the other for the work, the State would be
entitled to separate the agreement to sell from the agreement to do work and to impose a tax on the
sale of materials effected under the former agreement.

(7) Subsequent to the decision in Gannon Dunkerly's case, 1958-9 STC 353: (AIR 1958 SC560)
(supra) two decisions were given by the Supreme Court in which the principle enunciated in Gannon
Dunkerley's Case, (1958) 9 STC 353: (AIR 1958 SC 560) was affirmed by the Supreme Court and
applied in different situations arising in those cases. The first decision to which we must refer isthe
decision in New India Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, (1963) 14 S.T.C. 316: (AIR
11963 SC 1207). The question which arose in that case was whether supply of sugar made by the
petitioners to the State of Madras under directions given to them by the Sugar Controller in exercise
of the powers conferred upon him under the Sugar and Sugar Products Control Order, 1946,was
taxable as a sale under the Bihar Sales Tax, 1947. The argument urged on behalf of the petitioners
was that the dispatches of sugar made by the petitioners to the State of Madras were not the result of
any contract of sale and there was, therefore, no sale on which tax could be charged under the
provisions of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947. This argument was accepted by Shah J., who delivered
the majority judgment. The learned judge emphasized the consensual element in a sale and
following Gannon Dunkerley's case, (1958) 9 STC 353: (AIR 1958 SC 560) (supra) took the view that
in order to constitute a sale of goods must be transferred from the seller to the buyer under a
contract of sale. The learned Judge held that under the Sugar and Sugar Products Control Order,
1946, the petitioners were not left any volition but were bound on pain of forfeiture and
imprisonment to carry out the directions of the Sugar Controller and to despatch sugar to the State
of Madras as directed by him and there was, therefore, no contract of sale under which could be said
that was transfer of property in the goods from the petitioners to the State of Madras and concluded
that since there was no contract of sale under which property in the goods passed from the
petitioners to the State of Madras did not amount to sale and was, therefore, not taxable by the State
Legislature in exercise of its power under Entry 48 in List II to the Seventh Schedule to the
Government of India Act,1935. It would thus be seen that this division merely applied the principles
laid down in Gannon Dunkerlley's case (1958) 9 STC 353: (AIR 1958 SC 560) (supra) to the
consensual aspect of sale which one of the essential elements of sale laid down in Gannon
Dunkerrley's Case, (1958) 9 STC 353: (AIR 1958 SC 560).
(8) The other decision of the Supreme Court which was cited before us was the decision in Bhopal
Sugar Industries Ltd. v. D.P.Dube, (1963) 14 S.T.C.496: (AIR 1964 SC 1037). In this case the
extended definition of "retail sale" in Section 2(1) of the Madhya Pradesh Sales of Motor Spirit and
Lubricants Taxation Act, 1958 (Act 4 of 1958) included "consumption by a retail dealer himself or on
his behalf of motor spirit or lubricants sold to him for retail sale and the question arose whether this
extended definition was beyond, the competence of the State Legislature in that it brought within
the ambit of taxation a transaction which was not sale within the meaning of the Indian Sale of
Goods Act. the decisions in Gannon Dunkerley's Case, (1958) 9 STC 353: (AIR 1958 SC 560 ) and
New India Sugar Mills case,(1963) 14 STC 316: (AIR 1963 SC 1207) were based on Entry 48 in List II
of Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act, 1935, where as the legislative entry under
which the impugned legislation was made Entry 54 in Lists II of the Seventh Schedule to the
Constitution, but the Supreme Court held that did not make any difference in principle and" as the
scheme of division of legislative power under the Constitution has remained unaltered, the principle
of Gannon non Dunkerley's Case (1958) 9 STC 353 : (AIR 11958 SC 560) applies in adjudging the
validity of the provisions of Madhya Pradesh Act 4 of 1958". The Supreme Court thus applied the
same principle in the interpretation of Entry 54 in List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1250550/ 6State Of Gujarat vs Ramanlal Sankalchand And Co. on 8 November, 1963
and held that since consumption by an owner of goods in which he deals is not a sale within the
meaning of the Indian Sales Goods Act, is also not "sale of Goods" within the meaning of Entry 54 in
List II of Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and the extended definition of retail sale which
included consumption by a retail dealer himself of motor spirit or lubricant sold to him for retail
sale was, therefore, beyond the legislative competence of the State Legislature.
(9) It will be seen in all these cases the Supreme Court examined whether the transaction which was
sought to be taxed by the State Legislature was a sale within the meaning of Indian Sale of Goods
Act and wherever it found that the transaction was not such sale, it struck down the legislation in so
far as it purported to tax such transaction on the ground that the legislative power for levying tax on
sale of goods was restricted to enacting legislation for levying tax only on transactions which
conformed to the definition of sale of gods with in the meaning of the Indian Sale of Goods Act and
the State :Legislature was not entitled to tax any transactions which were not sale of goods strict
sensu. We must, therefore, address ourselves to the question whether the transaction in question in
the present case, namely, the allotment of goods of the firm amongst the partners on dissolution
could be said to be sale of goods within the meaning of the Indian Sale of Goods Act and in order to
determine this question must ask ourselves whether this transaction possessed the three elements
essential to sale of goods under the Indian Sale of Goods Act.
(10) Before we examine the question, it would be convenient to dispose of an argument advanced by
Mr.K.H.Kaji in support of his contention that allotment of a firm amongst partners on dissolution
did not constitute sale of goods within the meaning of the Indian Sale of Gods Act. the arrangement
was that if such allotment constituted sale of goods, it was not necessary to enact Section 26 (3) for
in that event such allotment would always fall within the scope and ambit of the charging Section by
reason of the definition of sale. But the Legislaature considered it necessary to enact Section 26(3)
and to treat such allotment fictionally as a sale because otherwise it would not be a sale. This
argument does not appeal to us. It is not infrequent that the Legislature enacts provisions ex majore
cantela with a view to rendering certain that which might otherwise be uncertain and the Legislature
may achieve this by using the word "deemed". The word: deemed" is used a great deal in modern
legislation and as observed by Lord Radcliffe, in St.Aubyn v. Attorney General, (1951) 2 All E R 473
at p.498. "sometimes it is used to put beyond counta particular construction that otherwise be
uncertain". This word is apt to include the obvious and uncertain and the impossible. no inference
cam, therefore, be raised from the use of a deeming provision that but for the deeming provision,
the subject matter of it would not fall within the main provision. Moreover it must also be
remembered that legislation founded on a mistaken or erroneous assumption has not the effect of
that making that law which the Legislature has erroneously assumed to be so. This argument
cannot, therefore, avail Mr.K.H.Kaji and we must proceed to consider whether, in fact, irrespective
of Section 26(3), allotment of the goods of the firm amongst the partners on dissolution constituted
sale of goods within meaning of the Indian Sale of Goods Act and for that purpose it must
ascertained whether such allotment possessed the three essentials elements of sale of goods to
which we have already referred.
(11) Now so far as the first elements of sale of goods agree concerned, namely, that there must be an
agreement between the parties for the purpose of transferring property in the goods and that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1250550/ 7State Of Gujarat vs Ramanlal Sankalchand And Co. on 8 November, 1963
property in the goods must actually pass as a result of agreement, we have no doubt that these
elements existed in the present transaction. But it is not necessary to discuss this aspect of the
question since in our opinion, the third element namely, that there must be money consideration for
the transfer of property in the goods, was absent and therefore even if the first two elements existed,
the transferring could not be a transaction of sale of goods within the meaning of the Indian Sale of
Goods Act. it was in respect of this third element that the learned Advocate General failed in his
attempt to make out that the allotment of goods of the firm amongst the partners on dissolution
constituted sale of goods within the meaning of the Indian Sale of Goods Act. we do not set how the
residue of the property of the firm after of payments of debts and liabilities and settlement of
accounts is divided amongst the partners in specie any money consideration can be said to have
been promised or paid by any partner to the firm or for the matter of that to the other partners as
consideration for the goods allotted to him. Consideration undoubtedly there would be, for the
partner to whom any particular goods are allotted on distribution would be giving up his interest the
goods allotted to the other partners in consideration of the other partners giving up their respective
interests in the goods allotted to such partner. But such consideration clan by no stretch of
imagination be called a money consideration. The learned Advocate General said in the course of the
argument that such consideration would be a consideration capable of being valued in terms of
money. But that is not determination of the question. Even in barter or exchange, the consideration
passing from the onepartyto another for the transfer of the property is a valuable consideration and
in many cases it would be capable of being valued in terms of money. But on that account it would
not become a sale. The essential characteristic of a sale is that there must be money consideration
fforn the transfer and it is this characteristic which is lacking in the present case. We are, therefore,
of the opinion that the allotment of goods of the firm amongst the partners did not constitute sale of
goods within meaning of the Indian Sale of Goods Act and that Section 26(3) in so far it purported
to bring such allotment to tax by fictionally treating it as a sale did not fall expressly within the
subject of legislation contained in Entry 54 in List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution.
(12) We must then proceed to consider whether Section 26 (3) can be regarded as a legislative
provision on a matter ancillary or subsidiary to the subject of legislation set out in Entry 54 and
whether it could be said be necessarily incidental to effective legislation on that subject. Now what is
incidental or ancillary in a given case must depend upon the main legislation andthe circumstances
of the particular case. It is in the last analysis lay down any hard and fast rule on the basis of which it
can be said that a particular provision is necessarily incidental to effective legislation or not. But one
thing is certain that the question of incidentally must, as observed by Griffith C. J., in Australian
Steamship Ltd. V. Malcolm, (1914) 19 C.L.R. 298, be determined ab extra, irrespective of
Parliamentary assumptions on the matter. The object of a particular provisions and the effect which
it produces often assist in the determination of the question whether such provision can be regarded
as an exercise of ancillary or subsidiary power of legislation it may also remembered that the
legislation must not under the guise of making an ancillary or subsidiary provision for the purpose
of effectuating the main legislation carry out an object beyond the powers of the legislature enacting
it and encroach upon a field not properly belonging to it. the provision must be regarded in its true
nature and character and it must be ascertained having regard to the object or purpose of the
provision also the effect produced by it as to whether it is really and truly a provision relating to an
ancillary or subsidiary matter or whether under the guise of making a provision on an ancillary or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1250550/ 8State Of Gujarat vs Ramanlal Sankalchand And Co. on 8 November, 1963
subsidiary matter what it really seeks to do is to trespass into other field. It is in the light of these
principles that we must now consider as to whether the provision enacted in Section 26 (3) is a
provision enacted by the Legislature on a matter ancillary or subsidiary to tax on sales and purchase
of goods and whether it was necessarily incidental to effective legislation on that subject.
(13) In order to determine this question it is necessary toexamine briefly the scheme of the Bombay
Sales Tax Act, 1953. The Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1953 came into force on 25th March 1953. It is
imposed two kinds of taxes, namely general sales tax aandspecial tax on sales of goods. It also
imposed purchase tax but that was only on certain kinds of purchase and that too in respect of all
goods but only in respect of certain goods which might be notified by the State Government. Section
9 required every dealer liable to pay general sales tax to obtain registration under the Act, the
scheme being that general sales tax should be chargeable only on a registered dealer and that an
unregistered dealer should not be chargeable to general sales tax. the definition of a dealer in
Section 2(6) included a firm by reason of the application of Section 3(35) of the Bombay General
Clauses Act and this definition coupled with the other provisions of the Act clearly showed - and this
was not disputed by the learned Advocate General - that the firm was recognized as an assessable
entity distinct from its partners for the purpose of taxation under the Act. section 26 (3) sought to
tax allotment of goods amongst partners or members in the event of dissolution or partition of a
firm in thefollowing words:
"26. (3) (I) When a firm liable to pay the tax is dissolved, or
(ii) where an undivided Hindu family liable to pay tax is partitioned, such firm or
family, as the case may be, shall be liable to pay the tax on the goods allotted to any
partner or member thereof as if the goods had been sold to such partner or member
unless he holds a certificate of registration or a licence, as the case may be, or obtains
it within the prescribed period".
This was the position as it obtained under the Act prior to its amendment. Sweeping amendments
were, however, made in the Act with effect from 1sr April 1954. The amendments altered the
structure of the various taxes imposed by the Act and instead of taxing the sale at multiple points as
was the position under the amended Act, the amended Act taxed the sales only at two points. Section
10 imposed purchase of goods specified in Column 1 of Schedule B at the rates, if any, specified
against such goods in Column 4 of that Schedule provided such purchase were made from an
unregistered dealer. section 8 imposed sales tax on sale of goods specified in Columns 1 of Schedule
B at the rates, if any, specified against them in Column 2 of that Schedule but declared that goods on
the purchase of which the dealer has paid or is liable to pay purchase tax shall not be liable to
included turnover of goods for the purpose of charge of sales tax. Section 10A provided that
notwithstanding anything contained in Section 8 or 10 a registered dealer who is liable to pay
purchase tax on purchase under Section 10 shall be entitled to elect to pay either purchase tax on
purchase of such goods or sales tax, if any on sale of such goods when they are sold without being
processed or altered in any manner so that he would liable to pay only one of the two taxes. A third
tax called general sales tax was also imposed by section 9 on sales of certain kinds of goods but that
tax was to be paid in any event irrespective of the liability to pay purchase tax on purchase of such

goods. Though the structure of the taxes was thus altered, Section 26(3) remained the same with
only this inconsequential difference that the words "or a licence, as the case may" which occurred in
that section were dropped. This was broadly the scheme of taxation embodied in the act as amended
from 1sdt April 1954.
(14) Relying on the provisions of the amended Act, the learned Advocate General contended that
having regard to those provision it was clear that Section 26(3) was a necessary provision for the
purpose of making effective the main legislation which imposed tax on sale or purchase of goods.
The argument was built up by taking the following steps. He contended that under the amended Act
apart fromthe general sales tax, the primary tax levied on a dealer was the purchase tax. If a dealer
purchased goods from an unregistered dealer, he was liable to pay purchase tax under Section 10
and in that event he would not be liable to pay sales tax under Section 8 when sold the goods. But by
section 10A he was given an option. He could by making an election postpone payment of tax and
pay it in the shape of sales tax when he sold the goods. This was the benefit conferred on a dealer by
the Act. but if the dealer happened to be a firm, the dealer could abuse this benefit by dissolving the
firm and distributing the goods of the firm in specie amongst the partners. In such a case the dealer
would escape both the sales tax and the purchase tax. It was in order to prevent this escapement of
tax that the Legislative enacted Section 26(3). Section 26(3) was intended to ensure the proper and
effective work of the Act by preventing escapement of tax which might result in the case of registered
firm which has opted in favour of paying sales tax if such firm distributes its goods in specie
amongst the partners. Of course, if the partner to whom the goods are allotted is registered, there
would be no difficulty, for when such partner sells the goods, sales tax would be recovered by the
State. Equally there would be no difficulty if such partner obtains registration within a prescribed
period for then the sale of the goods when made by him would be taxabale. But if such partners is
not registered and does not obtain registration within the prescribed period and sells the goods,
sales tax would not be chargeable and in such a case the State would lose the tax which would in any
event have been payable as purchase tax but for the election. The election provided in Section 10A
would, therefore enable the firm to escape tax by distributing the goods amongst the partners in
specie on distribution and this loophole was necessary to be plugged and was so plugged by the
Legislature by section 26(3). Section 26(3) was, therefore, necessary for making the main legislation
effective and was clearly within the ancillary or incidental power of the State Legislature.
(15) The argument though attractive is, in our opinion, defective in at least two respects. In the first
instance it is based on the provisions of fhe amended Act. The provisions which must be considered
for the purpose of deciding whether Ss.26 (3) can be justified as an exercise of ancillary or
subsidiary power are not the provisions of the amended Act but the provisions of the Act as
unamended in Section 26(3) formed part of the Act as originally enacted and it is at that date that
we must see whether the enactment of Sec.26 (3) was within the legislative competence of the state
legislature. If it was, the validity of the section must be declared to be invalid, for if the Section was
beyond the legislative competence of the State Legislature at the date when it was enacted, no
subsequent amendment of the Act can resuscitate it.
(16) But even if the subsequent amendments made in the Act can be taken into account, the
argument urged on behalf of the State must yet fail. If we look at Section 10A the legislative intent
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1250550/ 10State Of Gujarat vs Ramanlal Sankalchand And Co. on 8 November, 1963
and policy does not appear to be one that of the two taxes to be paid in any event. Section10A gives
an option to the dealer between the two taxes. If he opts in favour of paying purchase tax there is no
more questions about it for in that event he would always pay the purchase tax irrespective of the
fact as to what he does with the goods. If on the other hand he opts in favour of paying sales tax he
would not be liable to pay the purchase tax but would liable to pay only the sales tax, if any,. On the
sale of the goods when they are sold. The use of the words "if any" shows that the legislature
contemplated that no sales tax become payable by the dealer and the dealer as a result of the
election escape tax altogether. Suppose the goods such that on the purchase, tax is payable but not
on the sale. If such the case the dealer would not liable to pay purchase tax by reason of the election
and he would equally not be liable to pay sales tax because no sales tax would be chargeable. The
same consequence would also ensue when the sale effected by the dealer is a sale in the course of
inter-state trade or commerce or a sale outside the State of Bombay. These are cases where the
goods are sold but let us take a case where the goods may be destroyed or consumed by the dealer.
In such a case also the dealer would not pay purchase tax because of the election and would also not
pay sales tax because there is no sale. A dealer may gift the goods purchased by him and there also
the dealer would not liable either for payment of purchase tax or the payment of sales tax. The
language of Section 10A which gives the election clearly shows that the legislature did not intend
that in any event one of the two taxes should be paid. It clearly contemplated a possibility that where
option was exercised in favour of paying sales tax, neither tax may be payable. There was thus,
having regard to the legislative policy and intent, no loophole in the Act which required to be
plugged and Section 26(3) could not be said to have been enacted in exercise of an ancillary or
subsidiary power of legislation with a view to effectuating the main legislation. The object of Section
26(3) was to tax transaction which was not a sale by fictionally treating it as a sale and the attempt
was clearly beyond the legislative competence of the State Legislature.
(17) But as We pointed out above the provisions which we have to consider for the purpose of
determining the validity of Section 26(3) are the provisions of the Act as amended and it is in the
light of those provisions that we have to see whether on the date when Section 26(3) was enacted it
was a measure which could be justified by resort to the doctrine of ancillary or subsidiary powers.
On this part of the case the learned Advocate General contended that even under the unamended
Act, if a firm which was registered under the Act was allowed to distribute the goods in specie
amongst the partners on dissolution without attracting the charge of tax, the consequence would be
that there would be escapement of tax. If the firm sold the goods in the course of its business, it
would be liable to pay sales tax on the sale of the goods, but if the registered firm distributed the
goods in specie amongst the partners and any partner was not registered under the Act and did not
obtain registration within a particular period and sold the goods, tax at that point would be avoided
and the state would lose the tax. Section26 (3) was, therefore, intended to plug this loophole which
enabled tax at least one point to be avoided and the enactment of the section consequently an
exercise of ancillary or subsidiary power intended to ensure the proper and effective working of the
legislation. This argument is too unsosund and cannot be accepted. The ancillary or subsidiary
power of legislation can be exercised by the State Legislature only in aid of the main topic of
legislation, namely, tax on sale or purchase of goods. All necessary for the levy and collection of tax
what are really and truly sales or purchases of goods and for ensuring that such tax is not evaded are
comprised within the ambit of the legislative entry as ancillary or incidental powers and if any

provision is necessary for the purpose of taxing what are really and truly sales or purchases of goods
and making evasion of tax on such sales or purchases impossible, the state Legislature cam certainly
enact such provision. But the State Legislature cannot under the guise of exercise of ancillary or
incidental power of legislation tax transactions which are not sales by fictionally treating them as
sales. The ambit of incidental or ancillary power cannot go to the extent of permitting the State
Legislature to provide that though any particular transactions are not sales or purchases of goods,
they shall be taxed as if they were sales or purchase of goods. It is difficult to see how taxing of
transactions which are not sales or purchases of goods can be said to be ancillary or incidental to
levy or collection of tax on transactions which are really sales or purchases of goods. What in effect
the legislature did by Section 26(3) was to tell the dealer that if you had sold the goods, I could have
taxed them. But you did not sell them and therefore even though you nhaave not sold them, I shall
treat them as sold so that I can tax them. That is something which is not permissible to the State
Legislature. Tax becomes exigible only on sale or purchase of goods and if there is no sale or
purchase, tax is not chargeabale and in such a case it is not right to say that there is any escapement
of tax. If the event which attracts taxability does not happen, it is difficult to see how it can be said
that there is any avoidance of tax for the purpose of remedying which the State Legislature can
intervene. If the State Legislature can say that by allotment of goods amongst partners the firm is
avoiding tax and the state Legislature is, therefore, entitled to tax such allotment, the state
Legislature should equally be entitled to say that if a dealer instead of selling the goods purchased by
him gifts them or consumes them and thereby tax which would have been payable if the goods had
been sold is avoided, it can tax such gift or consumption as if it were a sale. Clearly such a thing
cannot be done and as a matter of fact the attempt of Madhya Pradesh Legislature to tax
consumption of goods by a dealer was declared to be ultra vires by the Supreme Court in Bhopal
Sugar Industries Case, (1963) 14 STC 406: (AIR 1964 SC 1037) On the same principle we do not see
how the attempt of the State Legislature in the present case can be sustained. The Act as it stood
quite effective in so far as it taxed sales of goods and if a dealer did not sell goods, he was obviously
not liable to pay tax and it could not be urged that since by not selling, a dealer would be avoiding
payment of tax, the State Legislature can treat him ass having sold the goods and tax him on that
footing. We are, therefore, of the opinion that in enacting Section 26(3) what the legislature did was
to enact an ancillary or subsidiary provision intended to ensure the proper and effective functioning
of the main legislation but to directly and expressly bring to tax a transaction which was not a sale
within the meaning of the Indian Sale of Goods Act by fictionally treating it as such sale. This was
constitutionally impermissible to the State Legislature.
(18) Before we part with this point we must refer to three decisions cited by the learned Advocate
General in his support of his contention that Section 26(3) was an ancillary or subsidiary provision
necessarily incidental to effective legislation on the subject of tax and purchase of goods. One was
the decision of the Indian Aluminum Co.Ltd. v. State of Madras,(1962) 13 STC 967: (AIR 1963 Mad
116 ) and the other two were decisions of the Supreme Court in Orient Paper Mills v. State of Orissa,
AIR 1961 SCA 1438 AAND Burmah Construction Co. v. State of Orissa, (1961) 12 STC 816 : (AIR
1962 SC 1320). It is not necessary to refer to these decisions in detail for they affirmed the same
principle which we have discussed above, namely, that the power to legislate on a particular topic of
legislation necessarily carries with it the power to legislate on all matters which are ancillary or
subsidiary to the main subject and merely applied that principle to the different situations arising in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1250550/ 12State Of Gujarat vs Ramanlal Sankalchand And Co. on 8 November, 1963
those cases. The principle of course is clear and cannot, as we have pointed out above, be disputed
but the question is what result does the application of the principle give in the present case. There
our answer is that Sec.26 (3) does not for reasons which we have given, represent an exercise of
ancillary or incidental power under the relevant legislative entry and must, therefore, struck down.
(19) In this view of the matter we must declare Section 26 (3) as ultra vires the State Legislature in
so far as it purported to tax allotment of goods of a firm amongst partners on dissolution. Our
answer to question No.1 will, therefore, be in the negative and question No.2 will not arise. The
applicant will pay to the opponents the cost of the Reference fixed at Rs. 450/-
(20) Answer accordingly.
