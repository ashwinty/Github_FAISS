Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163623824/ 1Satya Developers Pvt Ltd vs Pearey Lal Bhawan Association on 13 October, 2015
1. Pearey Lal Bhawan Association (in short „PLBA(cid:129)) filed two suits being CS(OS) Nos. 1016/2008
and 1018/2008 against Satya Developers Pvt. Ltd. (in short „Satya(cid:129)) whereas M/s Meattles Private
Limited (in short „Meattles(cid:129)) filed CS(OS) No. 512/2012 against M/s HDFC Bank Ltd. (in short
„HDFC Bank(cid:129)) seeking declaration and injunction qua the service tax paid in respect of rented
premises.
2. The plaintiffs in the suit sought a declaration holding the defendants to be liable to pay the service
tax leviable on the rent and the maintenance charges payable under the lease deed executed inter se
the parties, recovery of amount and mandatory injunction requiring the defendants to pay to the
plaintiff service tax of the amount on the lease rentals payable in future. Thus the three appeals are
being disposed off by a common judgment as they involve common question of law.
3. In CS (OS) Nos.1018/2008 and 1016/2008 Plaintiff PLBA claimed that it was a registered society
and being the owner of the building Pearey Lal Bhawan located at 2, Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New
Delhi-110002 had entered into a registered lease deed dated October 09, 2006 with the Defendant
Satya Developers in respect of an area measuring 500 sq.feet on the third floor of the premises
Pearey Lal Bhawan and in respect of an area measuring 2818 sq.feet on the ground floor of the
premises Peary Lal Bhawan. On October 16, 2006 the parties entered into a further agreement for
maintenance of common service and facilities. With effect from June 01, 2007 the Central
Government by amending Chapter-V of the Finance Act, 1994 levied service tax on renting of
immovable property for business purposes. It was claimed that the service tax being an indirect tax
has to be deposited by the service provider who was entitled to collect the same from the user of the
service as it was a tax on the service and not on the service provider.
4. In the written statements filed Satya referring to the following terms of the lease agreement
claimed that the parties have contracted that PLBA will pay the tax levied by the government and
thus it had no liability to pay the service tax:
"5. That the lessor shall continue to pay all or any taxes, levies or charges imposed by the MCD,
DDA, L&DO and or Government, Local Authority etc".
The defendant also relied on clause II (1) of the agreement for maintenance of common service and
facilities, which reads as under:
"II (1) That the Lessor to pay all rates, taxes, ground rent, house-tax charges,
fire-fighting tax, easements and outgoing charges imposed or payable to the MCD,
L&DO, DDA or Government in respect of the demised premises payable by the Lessor
and discharge all its obligations well in time".
5. In CS (OS) No.512/2012 Meattles claimed to be the lessor of the demised premises bearing
Nos.3909-3912, Hamilton Road, Mori Gate, Kashmere Gate, New Delhi measuring approximately
2700 sq.ft of built up area on the ground floor leased out to HDFC Bank vide the registered lease
deed dated November 25, 2004. The issue again raised was in relation to the service tax net w.e.f
June 01, 2007 vide notification No.23/2007-ST dated May 22, 2007 and Finance Act, 2007.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163623824/ 2Satya Developers Pvt Ltd vs Pearey Lal Bhawan Association on 13 October, 2015
6. In the written statement filed HDFC Bank also claimed that in terms of Clause 4(v) of the lease
agreement it was not liable to pay the service tax as agreed between the parties which is reproduced
as under:
"The municipal taxes, rates, charges and other outgoings in respect of the demised
premises that would be determined/fixed/varied from time to time by the Municipal
Corporation/Municipality/Gram Panchayat or any other local authority shall be paid
by the Lessor or the Lessee as specified/stipulated in the schedule annexed herewith
and shall keep the other party indemnified at all times against the same."
7. In CS (OS) Nos.1018/2008 and 1016/2008 the following common issues were settled except that
in issue No.3 in CS (OS) No.1016/2008 the amount was `3,55,270/- whereas in CS (OS)
No.1018/2008 the amount was `24,720/-:
"1. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a decree of declaration in favour and against
the defendant, holding that the defendant is liable to pay the service tax, which is
leviable on the rent and the maintenance charges payable under the lease deed dated
09.10.2006 and the Agreement of Maintenance for Common Services and Facilities
dated 16.10.2006, respectively?
2. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a decree of permanent mandatory injunction
against the defendant directing the defendant to pay to the plaintiff the amount of
service tax leviable on the rent and maintenance charges payable under the lease
deed dated 09.10.2006 and the Agreement of Maintenance for Common Service and
Facilities dated 16.10.2006 respectively, during the currency of the said agreements?
3. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to recovery of a sum of Rs.24,720/- paid by the
plaintiff, on behalf of the defendant, on account of service tax for the period
01.06.2007 to 31.03.2008?
4. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to interest on the amount of service tax paid by it
on behalf of the defendant during the pendency of the suit and if so, at what rate?
5. Relief."
8. The issues settled in CS (OS) No.512/2012 were:
"1. Whether the defendant is liable to pay service tax on rent, as alleged in the paint?
OPP
2. To what amount, if any, the plaintiff is entitled from the defendant? OPP.
3. Whether the suit is barred by limited? OPD."

9. In the three suits since beyond the documents no evidence was required to be led and the
documents were admitted, the parties agreed for the suits to be finally heard without leading
evidence.
10. The two learned Single Judges of this Court vide separate judgments dated December 20, 2010
in CS (OS) Nos.1016/2008 and 1018/2008 and October 19, 2012 in CS (OS) No.512/2012 decided
the suits in favour of the plaintiffs holding them entitled to recover amount payable towards the
service tax from the defendants.
11. Learned counsel for Satya contends that the learned Single Judge erroneously relied upon the
provisions of Sales of Goods Act, 1930 which have no application to service tax. Section 12B of the
Central Excise Act relied upon by the learned Single Judge applies only to refund of duty and does
not provide for the liability of the consumer to pay service tax. Section 68 of the Finance Act, 1994
and 1997 provided for collection of service tax which term has been changed by the Finance Act of
1998 and the liability has been fixed on the service provider to pay the service tax. By the lease
agreement the parties had contracted that taxes would be borne by the lessor and PLBA cannot now
wriggle out of the terms of the contract. Section 67 of the Finance Act provides for valuation of the
service tax which would be included in the „gross amount(cid:129) charged by a service provider which
provision has been ignored by the learned Single Judge. The case of Satya is covered by the decision
of Supreme Court reported as 2011 (13) SCC 497 Ultra Tech Cement Ltd. (Earlier Ultratech Cemco
Ltd.) vs. State of Maharashtra and Anr. Reliance is also placed on the decisions reported as 2012
(26) STR 289 SC Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd. vs. Dewan Chand Ram Saran, 2011 (22) STR 387 Max
New York Life Insurance Co. Ltd. vs.Insurance Ombudsman and Ors.and 2011 (22) STR 5 MP
Ravishankar Jaiswal vs.Jabalpur Development Authority and Anr. Referring to the decision
reported as AIR 1961 SC 1047 Commissioner of Sales Tax, Uttar Pradesh vs.The Modi Sugar Mills
Ltd. it is contended that in interpreting the taxing statute, equitable considerations are entirely out
of place nor can any taxing statute be interpreted on any presumptions or assumptions.
12. Learned counsel for HDFC Bank contends that Section 68 (2) of the Finance Act provides that
notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1) the Central Government is empowered to
notify in the official gazette the service tax on taxable services, as notified, to be paid by such person
and in such a manner as may be prescribed. However, there is no notification directing the lessee to
make the payment of service tax and hence in the absence of a notification no tax liability can be
fastened on HDFC. Referring to the decision reported as JT 2005 (1) SCC 449 Maruti Udyog Ltd.
vs.Ram Lal and Ors. it is contended that in construing a legal fiction, the purpose for which it is
created should be kept in mind and should not be extended beyond the scope thereof or beyond the
language by which it is created. Further a deeming provision cannot be pushed too far so as to result
in an anomalous or absurd position. Referring to the decision reported as 2012 (191) DLT 183
Raghubir Saran Charitable Trust vs. Puma Sports India Pvt. Ltd.it is contended that the service tax
liability has to be determined in terms of the contract between the parties.
13. Learned counsel for PLBA on the other hand contends that it is well settled that service tax is a
Value Added Tax (VAT) and being a consumption tax it is not a charge on the business but on the
consumer and would be thus leviable to whom the services are provided. It is further contended that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163623824/ 4Satya Developers Pvt Ltd vs Pearey Lal Bhawan Association on 13 October, 2015
ordinarily the burden of service tax has to be borne in law by the service recipient. Since service tax
is an indirect tax, the service provider can by an agreement assume the burden of such tax and
relieve the service recipient/consumer of the same. It is contended that from the terms of the lease
agreement and also the agreement for maintenance, the service provider has not assumed the
burden of paying the service tax and the liability would be that of the service recipient. The fact that
execution of the lease deed dated October 09, 2006 precedes the imposition of tax liability, there
was no possibility of any conscious assumption of any liability by PLBA as no such liability existed.
The words „shall continue to pay all or any tax(cid:129) in the lease agreement indicates that the liability of
the lessor was confined only to the existing levies which already stood imposed at the time of
execution of lease deed. Reliance is placed on the decision reported in (2007) 7 SCC 527 All India
Federation of Tax Practitioners & Ors.vs. Union of India & Ors., 2011 (2) SCC 352 Association of
Leasing and Financial Service Companies vs. Union of India & Ors., 182 (2011) DLT 548 (FB), Home
Solutions Retails (India) Ltd Union of India & Ors.
14. Shri Balbir Singh, Senior Advocate who had been requested to assist this Court in this matter
points out that the three essentials of a taxing statute are chargeability, receivability and assessment
component. Service tax being an indirect tax, though leviable on the consumer of the services
however, there is no mechanism by which the government can recover the same from the consumer.
Thus the liability of payment of the service tax has been fixed on the service provider, that is, the
lessor to be recoverable from the recipient, that is, the lessee. Referring to Section 64A of Sales of
Goods Act, 1930 it is stated that unless it is contracted to the contrary, the consumer of the goods
and thus the consumer of the services has to bear the liability of the tax. Referring to the decision of
the Supreme Court reported in 1997 (5) SCC 536 Mafat Lal Industries vs.Union of India & Ors. it is
contended that in case of indirect tax the Court would presume until a contrary is established that a
duty of excise or a custom duty has been passed on to the consumer. It is undoubtedly a rebuttable
presumption but the burden of rebutting it lies on the person who claims the refund. It is stated that
Section 64A of the Sales of Goods Act is based on rule of equity. Service tax being an indirect tax it is
possible that it may be passed on. Further the statutory provision can be of no relevance to
determine the rights and liabilities between the parties to the contract and there is nothing in law to
prevent the parties from entering into an agreement with the burden of any tax arising out of
obligation of a party under the contract to be borne by such party. Mr.Balbir Singh, Senior Advocate
points out that pursuant to the 8th report of the Law Commission goods under the Sales of Goods
Act, 1930 were provided to include the electricity, gas and water and amendments were also brought
by insertion of Section 64A by replacing Section 10 of the Tariff Act. Section 64A of the Sales of
Goods Act is a rule of equity based on the basic principle that indirect taxes can be passed on. It is
stated that it is akin to a situation where Limitation Act may not apply however, the principles of
Limitation Act would apply and thus the principles of passing on the liability as under the Excise
Act, Customs Act and Sales Tax Act would apply to the Service Tax as well. Indirectly provisions
relating to goods in Central Excise Tax have been made applicable to the Service Tax.
15. The Supreme Court in the decision reported in All India Federation of Tax Practitioners (Supra)
noted that service tax is an indirect tax levied on certain services provided by certain categories of
persons including companies, associations, firms, body of individuals etc. Service sector contributes
about 64% to the GDP. It noted that in contemporary world, development of service sector has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163623824/ 5Satya Developers Pvt Ltd vs Pearey Lal Bhawan Association on 13 October, 2015
become synonymous with the advancement of the economy and the Economists hold the view that
there is no distinction between the consumption of goods and consumption of services as both
satisfy the human needs. It was noted that „Value Added Tax(cid:129) (in short „VAT(cid:129)) which is a general
tax applies in principle to all commercial activities involving production of goods and provision of
services. The Supreme Court held that VAT is a consumption tax as it is borne by the consumer and
„Service Tax(cid:129) is a VAT which in turn is destination based consumption tax. The Supreme Court
noted that just as excise duty is a tax on value addition on goods, Service tax is on value addition by
rendition of services. Broadly „Services(cid:129) fall into two categories, namely, property based services
and performance based services. Property based services cover service providers such as architects,
interior designers, real estate agents, construction services, mandapwalas etc. and the later being
services provided by stock-brokers, practising chartered accountants, practising cost accountants,
security agencies, tour operators, event managers, travel agents etc.
16. In the decision reported as AIR 2012 SC 2829 Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd.vs. M/s Dewan Chand
Ram Saran it was held:
"26. As far as the submission of shifting of tax liability is concerned, as observed in
paragraph 9 of Laghu Udyog Bharati (Supra), service tax is an indirect tax, and it is
possible that it may be passed on. Therefore, an Assessee can certainly enter into a
contract to shift its liability of service tax. Though the Appellant became the Assessee
due to amendment of 2000, his position is exactly the same as in respect of Sales Tax,
where the seller is the Assessee, and is liable to pay Sales Tax to the tax authorities,
but it is open to the seller, under his contract with the buyer, to recover the Sales Tax
from the buyer, and to pass on the tax burden to him. Therefore, though there is no
difficulty in accepting that after the amendment of 2000 the liability to pay the
service tax is on the Appellant as the Assessee, the liability arose out of the services
rendered by the Respondent to the Appellant, and that too prior to this amendment
when the liability was on the service provider. The provisions concerning service tax
are relevant only as between the Appellant as an Assessee under the statute and the
tax authorities. This statutory provision can be of no relevance to determine the
rights and liabilities between the Appellant and the Respondent as agreed in the
contract between two of them. There was nothing in law to prevent the Appellant
from entering into an agreement with the Respondent handling contractor that the
burden of any tax arising out of obligations of the Respondent under the contract
would be borne by the Respondent."
17. Sections 65 (105) states „Taxabale Service(cid:129) means any service provided or to be provided:
"(zzzz) .....to any person, by any other person in relation to renting of immovable
property for use in the course or furtherance of business or commerce.
Explanation 1.--For the purposes of this sub-clause, "immovable property" includes--
(i) building and part of a building, and the land appurtenant thereto;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163623824/ 6Satya Developers Pvt Ltd vs Pearey Lal Bhawan Association on 13 October, 2015
(ii) land incidental to the use of such building or part of a building;
(iii) the common or shared areas and facilities relating thereto; and
(iv) in case of a building located in a complex or an industrial estate, all common areas and facilities
relating thereto, within such complex or estate, but does not include-
(a) vacant land solely used for agriculture, aquaculture, farming, forestry, animal husbandry, mining
purposes;
(b) vacant land, whether or not having facilities clearly incidental to the use of such vacant land;
(c) land used for educational, sports, circus, entertainment and parking purposes; and
(d) building used solely for residential purposes and buildings used for the purposes of
accommodation, including hotels, hostels, boarding houses, holiday accommodation, tents, camping
facilities.
Explanation 2.--For the purposes of this sub-clause, an immovable property partly for use in the
course or furtherance of business or commerce and partly for residential or any other purposes shall
be deemed to be immovable property for use in the course or furtherance of business or
commerce;..."
18. Section 83 of the Finance Act, 2007 makes certain provisions of the Central Excise Act, 1944 as
in force from time to time applicable in relation to Service Tax as they apply in relation to a duty of
excise:
"83. Application of certain provisions of Act 1 of 1944:
The provisions of the following section of the Central Excise Act, 1944 ( 1 of 1944), as
in force from time to time, shall apply, so far as may be, in relation to service tax as
they apply in relation to a duty of excise: -
9C, 9D, 11B, 11BB, 11C, 12 12A, 12B. 12C, 12D, 12E, 14, [14AA]*, 15, 33A, 35F, 35-FF to
35-O (both inclusive), 35Q, 36, 36A, 36B, 37A, 37B, 37C, 37D, [38A]* and 40."
19. Section 12 (b) of the Central Excise Act reads as under:
"12B. PRESUMPTION THAT INCIDENCE OF DUTY HAS BEEN PASSED ON TO
THE BUYER.
Every person who has paid the duty of excise on any goods under this Act shall,
unless the contrary is proved by him, be deemed to have passed on the full incidence
of such duty to the buyer of such goods."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163623824/ 7Satya Developers Pvt Ltd vs Pearey Lal Bhawan Association on 13 October, 2015
20. Thus Section 83 of the Finance Act is a legislation by incorporation applying inter alia Section
12B of the Central Excise Act to the Service Tax. Halsbury(cid:129)s Law of England (4th Edn., Vol.44 (1)),
para 127 page 744 deals with incorporation of other enactments by reference as under:
"It is a common device of legislative drafters to incorporate earlier statutory
provisions by reference, rather than setting out similar provisions in full. This saves
space and also attracts the case law and other learning attached to the earlier
provision. Its main advantage is a Parliamentary one, however, since it shortens Bills
and cuts down the area for debate."
21. In the decision reported as 2011 (3) SCC 1 Girnar Traders vs. State of Maharashtra and Ors.the
Constitution Bench while dealing with legislation by incorporation held that with the development
of law, the legislature has adopted the common practice of referring to the provisions of the existing
statute while enacting new laws. It was held that reference to an earlier law in the later law could be
a simple reference of provisions of earlier statute or a specific reference where the earlier law is
made an integral part of the new law, that is, by incorporation. In contrast to such simple reference,
legal incident of legislation by incorporation is that it becomes part of the existing law which implies
bodily lifting provisions of one enactment and making them part of another and in such cases
subsequent amendments in the incorporated Act could not be treated as part of the incorporating
Act. The obvious advantage of a legislation by incorporation is that the judicial precedents and
discussions on the earlier enactment apply to the later enactments.
22. Section 83 of the Finance Act 2007 though a legislation by incorporation also takes care of
non-applicability of future amendments as it provides for applicability of the relevant sections of the
Central Excise Act 1944 as in force from time to time i.e. the future amendments in the provisions of
the Central Excise Act would also be applicable mutatis Mutandis to Service Tax. As noted above,
Section 12B of the Central Excise Act which applies to the Service Tax raises a presumption that the
incidence of duty has been passed to the buyer unless the contrary is proved. Thus in the absence of
a contract for the liability of a service tax, it will be presumed that the same has been passed over to
the service recipient.
23. Based on the rule of equity similar provision exists in the Sales of Goods Act, 1930, that is,
Section 64A. The Supreme Court in the decision reported as 2007 (8) SCC 466 Numaligarh Refinery
Ltd.vs.Daelim Industries Co.Ltd held that whether a party is entitled to be paid such tax or such
increase has to be ascertained from the intention of the parties to the contract and unless a different
intention appears from the terms of the contract in the case of imposition or increase in the tax after
the making of a contract the party shall be entitled to be paid such taxes or such increase. It was
held:
"18. In this connection, learned Counsel has invited our attention to Section 64A of
the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 which reads as under:
"64-A. In contracts of sale, amount of increased or decreased taxes to be added or
deducted.- (1) Unless a different intention appears from the terms of the contract, in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163623824/ 8Satya Developers Pvt Ltd vs Pearey Lal Bhawan Association on 13 October, 2015
the event of any tax of the nature described in Sub-section (2) being imposed,
increased, decreased or remitted in respect of any goods after the making of any
contract for the sale or purchase of such goods without stipulation as to the payment
of tax where tax was not chargeable at the time of the making of the contract, or for
the sale or purchase of such goods tax-paid where tax was chargeable at that time-
(a) if such imposition or increase so takes effect that the tax or increased tax, as the
case may be, or any part of such tax is paid or is payable, the seller may add so much
to the contract price as will be equivalent to the amount paid or payable in respect of
such tax or increase of tax, and he shall be entitled to be paid and to sue for and
recover such addition; and
(b) if such decrease or remission so takes effect that the decreased tax only, or no tax,
as the case may be, is paid or is payable, the buyer may deduct so much from the
contract price as will be equivalent to the decrease of tax or remitted tax, and he shall
not be liable to pay, or be sued for, or in respect of, such deduction.
(2) The provisions of Sub-section (1) apply to the following taxes, namely;-
(a) any duty of customs or excise on goods;
(b) any tax on the sale or purchase of goods.
This section also clearly says that unless a different intention appears from the terms of the contract,
in case of the imposition or increase in the tax after the making of a contract, the party shall be
entitled to be paid such tax or such increase. In this connection, the intention of the parties is to be
ascertained, as per the clauses mentioned above.
24. In the decision reported as 1997 (5) SCC 536 Mafatlal Industries Ltd.& Ors.vs. Union of India &
Ors. a nine judges Bench of the Supreme Court of India while dealing with the claim of refund held
that the same was maintainable by virtue of declaration contained in Article 265 of the Constitution
of India as also under Section 72 of the Contract Act subject to one exception. Noting that the duties
under the Central Excise and Customs are indirect taxes and supposed to be and are permitted to be
passed on to the buyers it was held:
"80. For the purpose of this discussion, we take the situation arising from the
declaration of invalidity of a provision of the Act under which duty his been paid or
collected, as the bases, inasmuch as that is the only situation surviving in view of our
holding on (I) and (II). In such cases the claim for refund is maintainable by virtue of
the declaration contained in Article 265 as also under Section 72 of the Contract Act
as explained hereinbefore subject, to one exception : where a person approaches the
High Court or Supreme Court challenging the constitutional validity of a provision
but fails, he cannot take advantage of the declaration of unconstitutionality obtained
by another person on another ground; this is for the reason that so far as he is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163623824/ 9Satya Developers Pvt Ltd vs Pearey Lal Bhawan Association on 13 October, 2015
concerned, the decision has become final and cannot be re-opened on the basis of the
decision on another person's case; this is the ratio of the opinion of Hidayatullah, CJ.
In Tilokchand Motichand and we respectfully agree with it. In such cases, the
plaintiff may also invoke Section 17(1)(c) of the Limitation Act for the purpose of
determining the period of limitation for filing a suit. It may also be permissible to
adopt a similar rule of limitation in the case of writ petitions seeking refund in such
cases. But whether the right to refund or restitution, as it is called, is treated as a
constitutional right flowing from Article 265 or a statutory right arising from Section
72 of the Contract Act, it is neither automatic nor unconditional. The position arising
under Article 265 is dealt with later in Paras 75 to 77. Here we shall deal with the
position under Section 72. Section 72 is a rule of equity. This is not disputed by Sri
F,S. Nariman or any of the other counsel appearing for the appellants-petitioners.
Once it is a rule of equity, it is un-understandable how can it be said that equitable
considerations have no place where a claim is made under the said provision. What
those equitable considerations should be is not a matter of law. That depends upon
the facts of each case. But to say that equitable considerations have no place where a
claim is founded upon Section 72 is, in our respectful opinion, a contradiction in
terms. Indeed, in Kanhaiyalal, the Court accepts that the right to recover the taxes -
or the obligation of the State to refund such taxes - under Section 72 of the Contract
Act is subject to "questions of estoppel, waiver, limitation or the like", but at the same
time, the decision holds that equitable considerations cannot be imported because of
the clear and unambiguous language of Section 72. With great respect, we think that
a certain amount of inconsistency is involved in the aforesaid two propositions.
"Estoppel, waiver...or the like", though rules of evidence, are yet based upon rules of
equity and good conscience. So is Section 72. We are, therefore, of the opinion that
equitable considerations cannot be held to be irrelevant where a claim for refund is
made under Section 72. Now, one of the equitable considerations may be the fact that
the person claiming the refund has passed on the burden of duty to another. In other
words, the person claiming the refund has not really suffered any prejudice or loss. If
so, there is no question of reimbursing him. He cannot be re compensated for what
he has not lost. The loser, if any, is the person who has really borne the burden of
duty; the manufacturer who is the claimant has certainly not borne the duty
notwithstanding the fact that it is he who has paid the duty. Where such a claim is
made, it would be wholly permissible for the court to call upon the
petitioner/plaintiff to establish that he has not passed on the burden of duty to a
third party and to deny the relief of refund if he is not able to establish the same, as
has been done by this Court in I.T.C. In this connection, it is necessary to remember
that whether the burden of the duty has been passed on to a third party is a matter
within the exclusive knowledge of the manufacturer. He has the relevant evidence -
best evidence - in his possession. Nobody else can be reasonably called upon to prove
that fact. Since the manufacturer is claiming the refund and also because the fact of
passing on the burden of duty is within his special and exclusive knowledge, it is for
him to allege and establish that he has not passed on the duty to a third party. This is
the requirement which flows from the fact that Section 72 is an equitable provision
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163623824/ 10Satya Developers Pvt Ltd vs Pearey Lal Bhawan Association on 13 October, 2015
and that it incorporates a rule of equity. This requirement flows not only because
Section 72 incorporates a rules of equity but also because both the Central Excises
duties and the Customs duties are indirect taxes which are supposed to be and are
permitted to be passed on to the buyer. That these duties are indirect taxes, meant to
be passed on, is statutorily recognised by Section 64A of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930.
25. Noting sub-section 2 of Section 64A of the Sales of Goods Act expressly made sub-Section 1 of
Section 64A applicable to duty of customs or excise on goods and referring to the decisions of the
Federal Court in AIR 1942 FC 33 The Province of Madras vs.Boddu Paidanna & Sons and the
Supreme Court reported as AIR 1962 SC 1281 R.C. Jall v. Union of India it was held in Mafat Lal
(supra) that in such a situation, it would be legitimate for the Court to presume, until the contrary is
established, that a duty of excise or a customs duty has been passed on. It is a presumption of fact
which a Court is entitled to draw under Section 114 of the Indian Evidence Act the same being
undoubtedly a rebuttable presumption but the burden of rebutting it lies upon the person who
claims the refund and it is for him to allege and establish that as a fact he has not passed on the duty
and, therefore, equity demands that his claim for refund be allowed.
26. Thus as a legislation by reference sub-Section (2) of Section 64A of the Sales of Goods Act
making applicable sub-Section (1) of Section 64A to any duty of Customs or Excise on goods and as a
legislation by incorporation Section 83 of the Finance Act making applicable Section 12B of the
Central Excise Act to Service Act, Section 64A(1) is applicable to Service Tax. From the provisions as
noted and the decisions of the larger benches it is evident that a service tax is a VAT which in turn is
a destination based consumption tax and is to be borne by the consumer of goods. Further unless
contracted to the contrary, the consumer of service is liable to refund the said tax to the service
provider who in turn is liable to pay to the government.
27. From the legal position as noted it is evident whether the service tax liability has been agreed not
to be passed on to the recipient of the service would depend on the interpretation of clauses entered
into between the parties. Before adverting to the relevant clauses inter se the parties in the present
case it would be appropriate to note a few decisions on the interpretation of a contract.
28. The House of Lords in [1998] 1 WLR 896 Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd. vs. West
Bromwich Building Society summarized the principle of interpretation of contractual documents as
under:
"(1) Interpretation is the ascertainment of the meaning which the document would
convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would
reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at
the time of the contract.
(2) The background was famously referred to by Lord Wilberforce as the "matrix of
fact," but this phrase is, if anything, an understated description of what the
background may include. Subject to the requirement that it should have been
reasonably available to the parties and to the exception to be mentioned next, it
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163623824/ 11Satya Developers Pvt Ltd vs Pearey Lal Bhawan Association on 13 October, 2015
includes absolutely anything which would have affected the way in which the
language of the document would have been understood by a reasonable man.
(3) The law excludes from the admissible background the previous negotiations of the
parties and their declarations of subjective intent. They are admissible only in an
action for rectification. The law makes this distinction for reasons of practical policy
and, in this respect only, legal interpretation differs from the way we would interpret
utterances in ordinary life. The boundaries of this exception are in some respects
unclear. But this is not the occasion on which to explore them.
(4) The meaning which a document (or any other utterance) would convey to a
reasonable man is not the same thing as the meaning of its words. The meaning of
words is a matter of dictionaries and grammars; the meaning of the document is what
the parties using those words against the relevant background would reasonably have
been understood to mean. The background may not merely enable the reasonable
man to choose between the possible meanings of words which are ambiguous but
even (as occasionally happens in ordinary life) to conclude that the parties must, for
whatever reason, have used the wrong words or syntax: see Mannai Investments Co.
Ltd. v. Eagle Star Life Assurance Co. Ltd. [1997] A.C. 749.
(5) The "rule" that words should be given their "natural and ordinary meaning"
reflects the common sense proposition that we do not easily accept that people have
made linguistic mistakes, particularly in formal documents.
On the other hand, if one would nevertheless conclude from the background that something must
have gone wrong with the language, the law does not require judges to attribute to the parties an
intention which they plainly could not have had. Lord Diplock made this point more vigorously
when he said in Antaios Compania Naviera S.A. v. Salen Rederierna A.B. [1985] A.C. 191, 201:
"if detailed semantic and syntactical analysis of words in a commercial contract is
going to lead to a conclusion that flouts business commonsense, it must be made to
yield to business commonsense."
29. In [2009] 2 All ER, 26 Durham vs. BAI (Run Off) Ltd.(in scheme of arrangement) & other cases
the Queen(cid:129)s Bench Division while dealing with the construction of commercial contracts noted:
"(203) A summary of helpful principles, drawn largely from the words of Longmore
LJ in Absalom (on behalf Lloyd's Syndicate 957) v. TCRU Ltd (2005) EWCA Civ 1586
at (7), (2006) 1 All ER (Comm) 375 at (7), (2006) 2 Lloyd's Rep 129, and based upon
submissions to me by counsel, which I had approved, in the recent case of Reilly v.
National Insurance *Guarantee Corporation Ltd (2008) EWHC 722 (Comm) at (13),
(2008) 2 All ER (Comm) 612 at (13), was again the subject matter of agreement, and I
repeat and incorporate it:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163623824/ 12Satya Developers Pvt Ltd vs Pearey Lal Bhawan Association on 13 October, 2015
„(a) Ordinary Meaning. There is a presumption that the words to be construed should
be construed in their ordinary and popular sense, since the parties to the contract
must be taken to have intended, as reasonable men, to use words and phrases in their
commonly understood and accepted sense. (See also para (7)(i)-
(iii) in the judgment of Longmore LJ and in particular:
"The object of the inquiry is not necessarily to probe the „real(cid:129) intention of the
parties, but to ascertain what the language they used in the document would signify
to a properly informed observer.")
(b) Businesslike Interpretation. It is an accepted canon of construction that a
commercial document, such as an insurance policy, should be construed in
accordance with sound commercial principles and good business sense, so that its
provisions receive a fair and sensible application. (See also the words of Lord Diplock
in Antaios Cia Navieras SA v. Salen Rederierna AB, The Antaios (1984) 3 All ER 229
at 233, (1985) AC 191 at 201 cited at (7)(iv) by Longmore LJ: If a "detailed semantic
and syntactical analysis of words in a commercial contract is going to lead to a
conclusion that flouts business common sense, it must be made to yield to business
common sense".)
(c) Commercial Object. The commercial object or function of the clause in question
and its relationship to the contract as a whole will be relevant in resolving any
ambiguity in the wording.
(d) Construction to avoid unreasonable results. If the wording of a clause is
ambiguous, and one reading produces a fairer result than the alternative, the
reasonable interpretation should be adopted. It is to be presumed that the parties, as
reasonable men, would have intended to include reasonable stipulation in their
contract."
30. In 2009 (5) SCC 713 Vimal Chand Ghevarchand Jain & Ors. vs. Ramakant Eknath Jajoo the
Supreme Court reiterated the principle of construction of a commercial contract by looking at the
document as a whole and construing it in its entirety.
31. Thus a contract has to be construed by looking at the document as a whole and the meaning of
the document has to be what the parties intended to give to the document keeping the background
in mind and conclusion that flouts business commonsense must yield unless expressly stated. In the
present case it will also have to borne in mind whether the parties intend to include taxes which
were not contemplated at the time of the agreement as indubitably the agreements between the
parties in the three suits were entered into prior to the Finance Act, 2007 coming into force w.e.f.
June 01, 2007.

32. In the agreement between HDFC Bank and Meattles Clause 4(v) imposes liability of municipal
taxes, rates, charges and other outgoings in respect of the demised premises that would be
determined/fixed/varied from time to time by the Municipal Corporation/Municipality/Gram
Panchayat or any other local authority only. It is well settled that the Municipal Corporation,
Municipality, Gram Panchayat or local authority is distinct from the government and thus the clause
inter se the parties cannot be said to cover the exemption of HDFC Bank to pay to Meattles service
tax paid by it to the government pursuant to the Finance Act, 2007.
33. As regards the lease deed and the agreement of maintenance of common services and facilities
between Satya and PLBA Clause 5 of the lease deed as noted above provides that the lessor shall
continue to pay all or any taxes, levies or charges imposed by the MCD, DDA, L&DO and or
Government, Local Authority etc. By use of the words "Lessor shall continue to pay" it is evident that
the parties contemplated the existing taxes, levies or charges and not future. Even as per the
agreement of maintenance of common service facilities though the same has no application to the
service tax however, still the said clause II(1) cannot be said to exclude HDFC Bank from paying
future service tax.
34. In view of the discussion aforesaid the judgments and the decrees passed by the learned Single
Judge in the three suits are upheld. Appeals are dismissed. Parties will bear their own costs.
35. We place on record our appreciation for the valuable assistance rendered by Mr. Balbir Singh,
Senior Advocate/learned Amicus Curiae.
