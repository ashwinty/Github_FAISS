Whether the Permanent Lok Adalat constituted under Section 22B of the Legal Services Authorities
Act, 1987 (hereinafter referred to as `the Act') has jurisdiction to entertain a claim for compensation
under the provisions of the Kerala Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is the question to be considered in these
cases. The learned Single Judge has held that the Permanent Lok Adalat under Section 22B of the
Act has no such jurisdiction and hence the appeal. (The decision of the learned Single Judge is
reported in New India Assurance Company Ltd. v. Jameela WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 2
(2009(1) KLT 153). Since the same issue was pending before the learned Single Judge in other writ
petitions, those cases also have been tagged along with the appeal.
2. Permanent Lok Adalat is a new concept introduced under the Legal Services Authorities Act,
1987, by Act 37 of 2002. The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 was enacted to constitute Legal
Services Authorities for providing free and competent legal service to the weaker sections of the
society to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of
economic or other disabilities, and to organize Lok Adalats to secure that the operation of the legal
system promotes justice on a basis of equal opportunity. The source of inspiration and the obligation
is Article 39A of the Constitution of India, which reads as follows:-
"39A. Equal justice and free legal aid.--The State shall secure that the operation of the
legal system promotes justice, on a basis of equal opportunity, and shall, in
particular, provide free legal aid, by suitable legislation or schemes or in any other
way, to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by
reason of economic or other disabilities."
WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 3
3. Lok Adalat is an old form of adjudicating system prevailed in ancient India. The
expression literally means 'people court'. People find solution by themselves,
appropriately aided by lawmen and elders. It provides for alternative resolution of
disputes. It has been found to be viable, economic, efficient and informal. Parties to
the dispute directly interact with the Presiding Officer and through such informal
discussions, arrive at a settlement. The compromise or settlement is made an award
of the Lok Adalat which has the status and force of a decree under the Code of Civil
Procedure. There is no rancour to any parties since both parties win and none goes as
vanquished. Thus unless there is compromise or settlement between the parties, the
Lok Adalat cannot pass an award and the case has to go back to the court or the
parties will have to be advised to seek their remedy in a court of competent
jurisdiction, in case the latter is a pre-
litigation adalat. In that background, it was thought that at least in the case of disputes pertaining to
notified public utilities, designated Lok Adalat can be given the jurisdiction to decide the disputes
involving a property dispute and valued upto Rs.10 lakhs WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 4 in the
event of the parties failing to reach a settlement despite the conciliation and Chapter VI-A was
introduced by way of an amendment comprising of Sections 22A to 22E. Section 22A deals mainly
with the definition of public utility service, which reads as follows :-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/975382/ 2Bhoopesh vs M/S.New India Assurance Co.Ltd. on 10 August, 2009
"22A.Definitions-In this Chapter and for the purposes of section 22 and 23, unless
the context otherwise requires,-
(a) -----
(b) "public utility service" means any-
(i) transport service for the carriage of passengers or goods by air, road or water; or
(ii) postal, telegraph or telephone service; or
(iii) supply of power, light or water to the public by any establishment; or
(iv) system of public conservancy or sanitation; or
(v) service in hospital or dispensary; or
(vi) insurance service, and includes any service which the Central Government or the
State Government, as the case may be, may, in the public interest, by notification,
declare to be a public utility service for the purposes of this Chapter."
Section 22B provides for establishment of permanent Lok Adalath which reads as follows :-
22B. Establishment of Permanent Lok Adalats.- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section
19, the Central Authority or, as the case may be, every State Authority shall, by notification, establish
WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 5 Permanent Lok Adalats at such places and for exercising such
jurisdiction in respect of one or more public utility services and for such areas as may be specified in
the notification.
(2) Every Permanent Lok Adalat established for an area notified under sub-section (1) shall consist
of--
(a) a person who is, or has been, a district judge or additional district judge or has held judicial office

and
(b) two other persons having adequate experience in public utility service to be nominated by the
Central Government or, as the case may be, the State Government on the recommendation of the
Central Authority or, as the case may be, the State Authority, appointed by the Central Authority or,
as the case may be, the State Authority, establishing such Permanent Lok Adalat and the other terms
and conditions of the appointment of the Chairman and other persons referred to in clause (b) shall
be such as may be prescribed by the Central Government. Section 22C deals with cognizance of
cases by Permanent Lok Adalat, which reads as follows:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/975382/ 3Bhoopesh vs M/S.New India Assurance Co.Ltd. on 10 August, 2009

thereof and furnish a copy of the same to each of the parties concerned.
(8) Where the parties fail to reach at an agreement WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 8 under
sub-section (7), the Permanent Lok Adalat shall, if the dispute does not relate to any offence, decide
the dispute.
4. As far as regular Lok Adalat under Chapter VI is concerned, the cognizance is under Section 20
coming under Chapter VI which reads as follows :-
20. Cognizance of cases by Lok Adalats.- (1) Where in any case referred to in clause
(i) of sub-section (5) of Section 19-
(i) (a) the parties thereof agree; or
(b) one of the parties thereof makes an application to the court, for referring the case
to the Lok Adalat for settlement and if such court is prima facie satisfied that there
are chances of such settlement; or
(ii) the court is satisfied that the matter is an appropriate one to be taken cognizance
of by the Lok Adalat, the court shall refer the case to the Lok Adalat:
Provided that no case shall be referred to the Lok Adalat under sub-clause (b) of
clause (i) or clause (ii) by such court except after giving a reasonable opportunity of
being heard to the parties.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force,
the Authority or Committee organizing the Lok Adalat under sub-
section (1) of Section 19 may, on receipt of an application from any one of the parties to any matter
referred to in clause (ii) of sub-section (5) of Section 19 WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 9 that
such matter needs to be determined by a Lok Adalat, refer such matter to the Lok Adalat, for
determination :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/975382/ 5Bhoopesh vs M/S.New India Assurance Co.Ltd. on 10 August, 2009
Provided that no matter shall be referred to the Lok Adalat except after giving a reasonable
opportunity of being heard to the other party.
(3) Where any case is referred to a Lok Adalat under sub-section (1) or where a reference has been
made to it under sub-section(2), the Lok Adalat shall proceed to dispose of the case or matter and
arrive at a compromise or settlement between the parties.
(4) Every Lok Adalat shall, while determining any reference before it under this Act, act with utmost
expedition to arrive at a compromise or settlement between the parties and shall be guided by the
principles of justice, equity, fair play and other legal principles.
(5) Where no award is made by the Lok Adalat on the ground that no compromise or settlement
could be arrived at between the parties, the record of the case shall be returned by it to the court,
from which the reference has been received under sub-section (1) for disposal in accordance with
law.
(6) Where no award is made by the Lok Adalat on the ground that no compromise or settlement
could be arrived at between the parties, in a matter referred to in sub-section (2), that Lok Adalat
shall advise the parties to seek remedy in a court.
(7) Where the record of the case is returned under sub-section (5) to the court, such court shall
proceed to deal with such case from the stage which was reached before such reference under
sub-section(1). WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 10 The essential difference between Section 20
Lok Adalat and Section 22B Lok Adalat is that in the former the Lok Adalat has to make an attempt
to arrive at a compromise or settlement between the parties guided by the principles of justice,
equity, fair play and other legal principles, whereas in the latter, the Permanent Lok Adalat has to
conduct conciliation proceedings between the parties in such a manner as it thinks appropriate,
taking into account the circumstances of the dispute. In the process, the Permanent Lok Adalat has
to make an attempt to reach an amicable settlement of the dispute in an independent and impartial
manner. The Permanent Lok Adalat has thereafter to formulate the terms of the possible settlement
of the dispute and the parties agreeing for the terms of settlement as formulated by the Lok Adalath,
should sign the settlement, and Permanent Lok Adalat passes an award in terms of the settlement.
Despite all the attempts for conciliated settlement, in case Permanent Lok Adalat fails to reach an
agreement as above, the Permanent Lok Adalat is given jurisdiction to decide the dispute, if the
dispute does not relate to an offence and of course WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 11 subject to
the monetary value of property being below Rs.10 lakhs. Under Section 22D of the Act, it has also
been prescribed that in the conciliation proceedings or in deciding a dispute on merits, the
permanent Lok Adalat shall be guided by the principles of natural justice, objectivity, fair play,
equity and other principles of justice. The award thus passed by the Permanent Lok Adalat is also
having the status and force of the decree.
5. Under Section 22B of the Act, the Permanent Lok Adalat has jurisdiction only in respect of one or
more of public utility services as defined under the Act. The dispute in the instant case is as to
whether under the notified public utility service-Insurance Service, the permanent Lok Adalat can
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/975382/ 6Bhoopesh vs M/S.New India Assurance Co.Ltd. on 10 August, 2009
entertain and decide a dispute relating to a claim for compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act.
The expression `Insurance Service' is not defined under the Act. The expression `service' is defined
under Section 2(1) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which reads as follows:-
2(1)(o) "service" means service of any description which is made available to
potential users and includes, but not limited to, the provision of facilities WA
NO.316/09 & connected cases 12 in connection with banking, financing, insurance,
transport, processing, supply of electrical or other energy, board or lodging or both,
housing, construction, entertainment, amusement or the purveying of news or other
information, but does not include the rendering of any service free of charge or under
a contract of personal service."
Thus Insurance Service can be understood as a service of any description which is made available to
potential users, and includes facilities in connection with insurance. `Deficiency' has also been
defined under Section 2(1)(g) as "any fault, imperfection, shortcoming or inadequacy in the quality,
nature and manner of performance which is required to be maintained by or under any law for the
time being in force or has been undertaken to be performed by a person in pursuance of a contract
or otherwise in relation to any service." As far as a claim before the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal
is concerned, it is a claim for compensation in respect of accidents involving the death of, or bodily
injury to, persons arising out of the use of motor vehicles, or damages to any property of a third
party so arising, or both. In Dhulabhai v. State of M.P. (AIR 1969 S.C.
78), the Supreme Court had occasion to consider the question of WA NO.316/09 & connected cases
13 jurisdiction of the special Tribunals. It has been held that "Where the statute gives a finality to the
orders of the special tribunals the civil courts' jurisdiction must be held to be excluded if there is
adequate remedy to do what the civil court would normally do in a suit. Such provision, however,
does not exclude those cases where the provisions of the particular Act have not been complied with
or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial
procedure". Thus when a statute creates a special tribunal, only that special tribunal has the
jurisdiction to deal with those matters for which the Tribunal is constituted and no other forum,
unless the power is specifically conferred on it. No doubt, under Section 25 of the Legal Services
Authorities Act, the Act has an overriding effect. Section 25 of the Act reads as follows :-
25. Act to have overriding effect.- The provisions of this Act shall have effect
notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained any other law for the
time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than
this Act.
But it has to be seen that the Act itself was introduced for imparting legal service and for organizing
Lok Adalats to secure WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 14 that the operation of the legal system
promotes justice. That justice is justice in accordance with law. Under law, the very concept of Lok
Adalat is compromise or settlement. There is no decision by the Adalat. However, Chapter VI-A has
been introduced by Act 37 of 2002, providing for "pre-litigation conciliation and settlement". To
refer to the statement of objects and reasons of the Amending Act 37 of 2002, it is seen that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/975382/ 7Bhoopesh vs M/S.New India Assurance Co.Ltd. on 10 August, 2009
Amending Act was intended only to petty cases pertaining to public utility services where there is
need for urgent settlement of the disputes so that people get justice without delay even at pre-
litigation stage. Paragraph 2 of the statement of objects and reasons of the Amending Act 37 of 2002
reads as follows :-
2. However, the major drawback in the existing scheme of organization of the Lok
Adalats under Chapter VI of the said Act is that the system of Lok Adalats is mainly
based on compromise or settlement between the parties. If the parties do not arrive
at any compromise or settlement, the case is either returned to the court of law or the
parties are advised to seek remedy in a court of law. This causes unnecessary delay in
the dispensation of justice. If Lok Adalats are given power to decide the cases on
merits in case parties fail to arrive at any compromise or settlement, this problem can
be tackled to a great extent. Further the cases which arise in relation to WA
NO.316/09 & connected cases 15 public utility services such as Mahanagar Telephone
Nigam Limited, Delhi Vidyut Board, etc. need to be settled urgently so that people get
justice without delay even at pre-litigation stage and thus most of the petty cases
which ought not to go in the regular Courts would be settled at the pre-litigation stage
itself which would result in reducing the workload of the regular Courts to a great
extent. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 to
set up Permanent Lok Adalat for providing compulsory pre-litigative mechanism for
conciliation and settlement of cases relating to public utility services.
6. The scheme of functioning of the Permanent Lok Adalat as envisaged in the Act would show that
it is not intended for adjudication. It is intended to settle the disputes through conciliation. After
following the elaborate procedure in the matter of conciliation and settlement of the dispute, in case
the parties fail to reach an agreement in respect of the terms of possible settlement as formulated
after conciliation, then alone the Permanent Lok Adalat is given power to decide the dispute. In this
context, it would be profitable to refer to the bench decision of the Punjab and Haryana High Court
reported in Union Territory, Chandigarh v. Permanent Lok Adalat & Another [AIR 2009 (NOC) 496
(Punjab & Haryana)]. It has been held in the WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 16 said decision at
paragraph 8 as follows :-
"The power to decide dispute under sub- section (8) is not plenary power but will
take its colour from the preceding provision of Section 22C."
It has also been held at paragraph 9 as follows :-
"9. The Act has been enacted as an alternative dispute resolution for resolving the
disputes in a spirit of conciliation outside the Court. Chapter VIA has been
introduced with the object that though the system of Lok Adalat is mainly based on
compromise or settlement between the parties but if the parties do not arrive at
compromise or settlement, the case is either returned to the Court of law or the
parties are advised to seek remedy in the Court of law. To avoid unnecessary delay in
the dispensation of justice, Lok Adalats were given the powers to decide the cases on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/975382/ 8Bhoopesh vs M/S.New India Assurance Co.Ltd. on 10 August, 2009
merit as well. Still further, the cases of public utility service need to be settled
urgently so that people can get justice and most of the petty cases which ought not to
go in the regular courts may settle at pre-litigation stage. Therefore, permanent Lok
Adalat though has the power to decide the cases on merit but such decision is at
pre-litigation stage and where relief claimed is urgent and in petty cases. In the
context of the aforesaid principle, present is a case where there are numerous civil
court decrees for and against the parties. The decrees cannot be said to be binding on
the parties which are not before the Court.
Such disputes are not intended to be decided by the Permanent Lok Adalat. Permanent Lok Adalats
are not alternative courts but have been established to provide immediate relief to the aggrieved
citizens against the inaction or wrongful action of the authorities dealing with public utility service
in day to WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 17 day life. The present dispute is beyond the scope of
Permanent Lok Adalats."(emphasis supplied) In United India Insurance Company Limited v. Ajay
Sinha and another [(2008)7 Supreme Court Cases 454], the Supreme Court had occasion to
consider the scope of the Permanent Lok Adalat. It has been held therein that "With respect to
public utility services, the main purpose behind Section 22-C(8) seems to be that most of the petty
cases which ought not go in the regular courts, would be settled in the pre-litigation stage itself." As
far as adjudication of claims for compensation is concerned, every claim will have to be considered
on merits and on an adversarial basis, the compensation will have to be fixed. That jurisdiction has
been exclusively conferred on the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals set up under Section 165 of the
Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The Supreme Court in Chairman, Thiruvalluvar Transport Corporation v.
Consumer Protection Council [1995(2) Supreme Court Cases 479] considered the question as to
whether the Forums under the WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 18 Consumer Protection Act had
jurisdiction to deal with claims for compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act. It has been held at
paragraph 6 of the judgment as follows :-
"We have, therefore, no manner of doubt that this case squarely fall within the ambit
of Section 165 of the 1988 Act and the Claims Tribunal constituted thereunder for the
area in question had jurisdiction to entertain the same. As pointed out earlier, the
1988 Act and, in particular, the provisions in Chapter XII thereof creates a forum
before which the claim can be laid if it arises out of an accident caused by the use of a
motor vehicle. That being a special law would prevail over the relevant general law
such as the 1986 Act ......"
Therefore, it is fairly clear that once the special tribunals under Section 165 of the Motor Vehicles
Act 1988 have been set up for deciding the claims for compensation arising out of the use of the
motor vehicle, no other forum has jurisdiction to adjudicate such claims, unless such power is duly
and specifically conferred on those Forum.
7. Then the question is whether "insurance service" as notified under Section 22A of the Act would
take in the claims against insurance companies, who have indemnified the owner of the motor
vehicle. We do not think that any elaborate discussion WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 19 is
required to answer the question in the negative since the service of insurance under Chapter VI-A of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/975382/ 9Bhoopesh vs M/S.New India Assurance Co.Ltd. on 10 August, 2009
the Act is one of the public utility services. The Supreme Court in United India Insurance Company
Limited v. Ajay Sinha and another (supra) has held that "Ordinarily, insurance service would not
come within the public utility service. But having regard to the statutory scheme, it must be held to
be included thereunder. It is one thing to say that an authority is created under a statute to bring
about a settlement through alternate dispute resolution mechanism but it is another thing to say
that an adjudicatory power is conferred on it." In view of the exclusive jurisdiction conferred on the
Tribunals set up under Section 165 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 to adjudicate motor accident
claims it has to be held that the insurance service contemplated under Section 22A of the Act would
only take in grievance on deficiency in service rendered by insurance companies to the policy
holders. Adjudication of claims for compensation on account of motor vehicle accident is outside the
purview of the Permanent Lok Adalat for public utility services. Thus we find it difficult to agree
with the view to the contra taken by the Jharkhand High Court in National Insurance Company Ltd.,
v. Vijay Kumar Sharma and others (2009 ACJ 403). With great respect, we may also note that there
are no detailed discussions on these aspects in the above decision.
8. For the above reasons, we do not find any merit in WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 20 the writ
appeal. The Permanent Lok Adalat does not have jurisdiction to entertain claim petitions for
compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Therefore, we dismiss the writ appeal and allow
the writ petitions, quashing the impugned orders. Learned counsel for the Insurance Companies
submit that they filed the writ petitions only on principle and except in the case of impugned orders
in W.P.(C) Nos.5887 and 9687 of 2009, they are prepared to pay the money, treating the cases as
duly settled between the parties. In view of the above submission, there will be a direction to the
Insurance Companies to pay the amounts as per the impugned orders, except in W.P.(C) Nos.5887
and 9687 of 2009 to the respective claimants, treating the claims as duly settled.
9. Before we part, we may note that Chapter VI-A of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 has
been introduced for pre-litigation conciliation and settlement. Any dispute before taking the shape
of a litigation should be attempted to be conciliated and settled at the pre-litigation stage, to the
extent permitted under Chapter VI-A of the Act. Under Chapter VI, Lok WA NO.316/09 & connected
cases 21 Adalats are constituted for compromise and settlement. The Permanent Lok Adalat is
manned by a person who has been a District Judge or Additional District Judge or a Judicial Officer
higher in rank than that of a District Judge as Chairman and two other persons having adequate
experience in public utility service. In case the District Legal Services Authority or for that matter,
the Kerala State Legal Services Authority is able to organise a regular Lok Adalat under Section 19 of
the Act by making use of the service of the Chairman of the Permanent Lok Adalat, it would be a
great help to the people and Insurance Companies, since 75% of the claims can be settled at the pre-
litigation stage, in case the Insurance Companies and parties cooperate. We are aware that the
Kerala State Legal Services Authority has taken steps to organise such a regular Lok Adalat under
Section 19 of the Act making use of the service of the Chairman and members. Therefore, it will be
open to the parties who intend to file claim petitions before the Motor Accidents Claim Tribunals in
Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam and Pathanamthitta Districts to first approach the Permanent Lok
WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 22 Adalat, Thiruvananthapuram, where there is also a regular
Lok Adalat in terms of Section 19 of the Kerala Legal Service Authorities Act for those districts.
Similarly, in the matter of other disputes also other than a case or matter relating to an offence not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/975382/ 10Bhoopesh vs M/S.New India Assurance Co.Ltd. on 10 August, 2009
compoundable under any law, falling within the jurisdiction of the three districts, the parties are
free to approach the same Lok Adalat for settlement or compromise. In the event of such petitions
being received in the Adalat, steps shall be taken promptly to see whether a settlement is possible.
Such steps shall be completed within six months from the date of receipt of the petitions. If a
settlement is arrived at, the Adalat shall pass awards and in case there is no settlement, the parties
shall be informed to pursue the matter before the respective Motor Accidents Claims
Tribunals/respective Tribunals/Courts.
10. It is brought to our notice that though the Government had proposed three Permanent Lok
Adalats- Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam and Kozhikode, only the one at Thiruvananthapuram
was established. We direct the Government to set up the remaining two at Ernakulam and
Kozhikode within WA NO.316/09 & connected cases 23 four months. A copy of this judgment shall
be communicated to the Chief Secretary forthwith.
