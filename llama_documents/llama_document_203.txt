PRESENT
HON'BLE DR. JUSTICE VINEET KOTHARI
REPORTABLE
Mr. M.C.Bhoot, Sr. Advocate along with
Mr. Surendra Singh, for the petitioner.
Mr. Himanshu Maheshwari, for the respondents.
BY THE COURT:
1. The petitioner, Jodhpur Development Authority, through its Commissioner, has approached this
Court by way of present batch of writ petitions, inter alia, claiming the quashing of judgment and
order dated 26/10/2009 passed by the District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum, Jodhpur on a

2. The facts giving rise to these writ petitions by a public body, Jodhpur Development Authority (
`JDA' for short) which substituted the Urban Improvement Trust, Jodhpur ( `UIT' for short) under
the Jodhpur Development Authority Act, 2009, are as under.
3. The land comprising of 46 khasras in khasra no. 771, 769 and 805/769 and khasra no. 751/43 in
Jodhpur was set apart for residential purposes and placed under the disposal of UIT, Jodhpur in
1974. Certain persons disputed the said land to be government land and claimed that they
purchased the land from khatedars and got the land converted under the relevant rules and
obtained Pattas from the Land Conversion Officer, Jodhpur.

Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum & Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011
4. Shorn of unnecessary details about litigations about these lands, the relevant facts would require
mention of a resolution passed on 9/1/1997 (Ex.1) by UIT, Jodhpur and 17 members of the UIT
headed by Mr.Damodar Bang as Chairman of the UIT, Jodhpur attended the said meeting and inter
alia it was decided that out of aforesaid 46 khasras leaving aside khasra no. 751/43 for the
residential colony Polo Link Society, for remaining khasra no. 771, 805/769, 809/771, 810/771,
811/771, 813/771 and 813/1/771 a map be prepared for developing this land and after leaving place
for public garden, roads and after removal of encroachments, patta holders may surrender their
respective title in favour of UIT & they would be reallotted the same as residential plots after
realizing a sum of Rs. 560/- per sq. mtr. so that said residential colony of these lands may be
developed to be named as `Samanvay Nagar' and `Shyam Nagar'. Broadly, it was decided that 20% -
25% of land would be reduced from their surrendered measurement of land, which will provide land
for development of roads etc.
5. The bone of contention in the present case between the parties is the part of this Resolution dated
9/1/1997 which said that if there is S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11 other
connected writ petitions ( See Schedule) Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State
Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum & Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 any encroachment on any plot of land in these two colonies known as
`Samanvay Nagar' and `Shyam Nagar', the liability to remove such encroachment will be that of the
lessee or patta holder himself and UIT, Jodhpur will only provide all possible cooperation for the
same.
6. It is not in dispute that complainant respondent was given a 99 years lease by the petitioner
Jodhpur Development Authority (the then UIT, Jodhpur) upon surrender of original title deed in
favour of UIT, Jodhpur and illustratively taking the facts of Civil Writ Petition No. 11316/2010, the
respondent no. 4 Shri Lakhpat Dhankani was given allotment of plot no. 35/2 measuring 343.35
sq.mtr. in khasra no. 771 vide allotment letter Ex.3 dated 26/3/2004.In the said allotment letter
dated 26/3/2004, the UIT, Jodhpur clarified that after developing roads and removal of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1047990/ 2Jodhpur Development Autho., ... vs State Consumer Disp. Red. Forum & ... on 11 October, 2011
encroachment from the plot of land in question, the demarcation of exact location of plot would be
made and as a result of that site plan attached with the lease deed may also require amendment
which will be acceptable to the allottee. Accordingly, for the area of land measuring 60x45 ft. allottee
- respondent no. 4 was called upon to deposit the sum of Rs.2,13,710/-, which he deposited and
condition no. 10 of the said allotment letter S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11 other
connected writ petitions ( See Schedule) Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State
Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum & Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 further required that the allottee shall have to raise construction within
five years from the date of giving of the possession, otherwise, the land will revert back to the UIT.
Thereafter, 99 years lease deed was executed between the parties on 31/3/2004.
7. The complainant respondent no.4 filed complaint under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection
Act against the UIT, Jodhpur vide Ex.5 that despite lease deed executed and full money taken, the
respondent UIT has failed to demarcate the exact plot of land and after removal of encroachment,
has failed to handover the physical possession of the plot no. 336 and, therefore, the actual
possession may be directed to be given to the complainant and if it is not possible to give possession
of the said plot of land, alternative plot of same measurement in same locality for the price already
paid may be allotted to him. Damages on account of harassment and litigation etc. was also claimed
amounting to Rs.63,000/-. The UIT contested the said complaint before the District Consumer
Disputes Redressal Forum - respondent no.2 and relied upon the aforesaid condition in the
Resolution dated 9/1/1997 that liability to remove the encroachment was on the complainant
himself and, therefore, there S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11 other connected writ
petitions ( See Schedule) Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State Consumer Disputes
Redressal Forum & Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 was no deficiency in service given by the respondent UIT, Jodhpur. It was
also contended that the complainant was neither the `consumer' nor the UIT, Jodhpur was a
`service' provider under the said Consumer Protection Act of 1986 and, therefore, the complaint
deserves to be rejected. The plea that the complainant was not a `consumer' and UIT, Jodhpur was
not a `service' provider was, however, not raised in reply filed on behalf of the UIT, Jodhpur vide
Ex.6. The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum vide its judgment dated 26/10/2009 held
that the UIT, Jodhpur (now Jodhpur Development Authority) is guilty of providing defective service
to the complainant and, therefore, directed that physical and vacant possession of the plot of land in
question should be handed over to the complainant and in case it is not possible due to any
encroachment on the said plot of land, an alternative plot in the same locality of the same
measurement may be allotted to the complainant and possession of the same may be handed over to
him. Compensation of Rs. 53,000/- was also awarded in favour of complainant and the Divisional
Commissioner - respondent no. 3 was directed to hold inquiry against the responsible officers and
employees of UIT, Jodhpur for deficiency in service and recover such S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION
NO. 11316/2010 & 11 other connected writ petitions ( See Schedule) Jodhpur Development
Authority, Jodhpur vs. State Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum & Ors.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1047990/ 3Jodhpur Development Autho., ... vs State Consumer Disp. Red. Forum & ... on 11 October, 2011
8. The petitioner, Jodhpur Development Authority, filed an appeal under Section 15 of the
Consumer Protection Act against the said judgment dated 26/10/2009 before the State
Commission.
9. In para no.9 of the said memo of appeal Ex.8, the JDA, Jodhpur also raised an objection that
neither the complainant was a `consumer' nor the petitioner UIT/JDA, Jodhpur was a `trader' or
`service' provider as defined in the Consumer Protection Act and, therefore, the complaint deserves
to be rejected as not maintainable.
10. By the judgment and order dated 6/1/2010 dismissing the appeal of Jodhpur Development
Authority, Jodhpur, the State Commission also affirmed the order of District Consumer Disputes
Redressal Forum, however, amount of compensation was reduced from Rs.53,000/- to Rs. 20,000/-
only and thus, for statistical purposes, the appeal was partly allowed to this extent.
11. Being aggrieved of these two orders, the Jodhpur Development S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.
11316/2010 & 11 other connected writ petitions ( See Schedule) Jodhpur Development Authority,
Jodhpur vs. State Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum & Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 Authority, Jodhpur has approached this Court way of present writ petition
& other connected writ petitions.
12. Before coming to the rival contentions, it would also be necessary to take note of the fact that in
one of the similar cases as arising at the instance of respondent no.4, Mr. Lakhpat Dhankani for the
same scheme under the same Resolution, another lease was executed in favour of one Mr. Laxman
Khetani, who is said to have been a member of UIT, Jodhpur at the relevant point of time. In his
case, when the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum similarly granted relief to the
complainant- Laxman Khetani vide order dated 25/11/2006 in complaint case no. 253/2006
(Laxman Khetani vs. Secretary, UIT, Jodhpur), the appeal filed by the UIT, Jodhpur namely; appeal
no. 415/2007 came to be dismissed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum on 5/3/2008
vide Ex. R/4/2. The revision petition against the said order of State Commission under Section 21
(b) of the Consumer Protection Act before the National Commission, New Delhi came to be filed by
UIT and besides assailing the orders on merits, the point relating to applicability of Consumer
Protection Act was also raised in the memo S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11 other
connected writ petitions ( See Schedule) Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State
Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum & Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 of revision petition vide ground no. (b) of the said memo vide Ex. R/4/3.
The National Commission also dismissed the revision petition of the Jodhpur Development
Authority vide order Annex.R/4/4 dated 15/4/2010 by a detailed order running into 8 pages. The
following extract from the order passed by the National Commission in that matter is reproduced
below for ready reference in which quoting from the order of State Commission, the National
Commission held that the petitioner UIT/JDA is clearly guilty of deficiency in service and changing
its stand from time to time to wriggle out of its commitment and since possession of plot of land was
not handed over to the respondent complainant, there is no merit in the revision petition and same
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1047990/ 4Jodhpur Development Autho., ... vs State Consumer Disp. Red. Forum & ... on 11 October, 2011
was accordingly dismissed. The State Commission in its order has also held that the condition
imposed in the resolution dated 9/1/1997 that the allottees/ lease holders will themselves be liable
to remove the encroachment was not palatable and no such condition could be imposed on the
lessees. Said relevant portion of the order of the State Commission quoted by the National
Commission & its own order is reproduced below for ready reference:
"We fail to understand how this condition S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11 other
connected writ petitions ( See Schedule) Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State
Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum & Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 could be imposed by the appellant. This appears to be a unilateral decision
taken by the Trust without taking the allottees into confidence. The allottees should have been
informed of the decision. It is a one side stand, which could not be made applicable to the
complainant. Even otherwise such a resolution was never brought to the notice of the learned
forum. If we look at the allotment letters issued in relation to the plots in question, we find that no
such condition was imposed. On the contrary it was made clear that the physical demarcation would
be possible only after the trespassers are removed from the site. This shows that the possession was
to be handed over after shifting the trespassers. The letters dated 14th May, 2004 and 2nd June,
2004 further go to show that the concerned officers were asked to assist the complainant in taking
the physical possession of land in question. As the possession has not yet been handed over to the
complainant, the order passed by the learned Forum cannot be said to be perverse or illegal. The
learned Forum has rightly awarded the amount of compensation to the complainant and it has also
rightly fastened the responsibility on the erring officers because of not handing over the possession
after removing the trespassers. Instead of taking a suitable action against the trespassers the
S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11 other connected writ petitions ( See Schedule)
Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum & Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 allottees are being asked to remove them at their own level, which shows
the callous attitude of the officers in not providing the required relief. In fact the officers of the Trust
have failed to discharge their duties in a right perspective. We also note that the complainant has
unnecessarily been dragged to this Commission by filing appeal, knowing fully well that the stand
taken before the Forum was contrary to the record."
Nothing has come on record that the petitioner had in any way provided any help to the respondent
in the eviction of the encroachment.
We agree with the view taken by the fora below.
Petitioner is clearly guilty of deficiency in service. Petitioner has been changing its stand from time
to time to wriggle out of his commitment. Possession was not handed over to the respondent even
after receiving full payment. No merit. Dismissed.

13. A Special Leave Petition was filed by the Jodhpur S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010 &
11 other connected writ petitions ( See Schedule) Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State
Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum & Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 Development Authority under Article 136 of the Constitution of India
before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India against the judgment and order of National Commission,
which SLP No. 499437/2010 (Jodhpur Development Authority vs. Laxman Khetani) was also
summarily dismissed by the Apex Court on 6/9/2010. CONTENTIONS OF PETITIONER JDA/UIT
14. Learned counsel for the petitioner- JDA, Mr. M.C.Bhoot, vehemently submitted as under:
(i) That the complainant respondent was bound by the condition contained in the Resolution dated
9/1/1997-Ex.1, which was not brought to the notice of the National Commission or Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Laxman Khetani, therefore, JDA cannot be held responsible for removal of
encroachment, if any, on the plot of land once lease deed was executed in favour of the complainant,
as per the said Resolution and it was his responsibility altogether and, therefore, the impugned
judgment of District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum as well as State Consumer Disputes
Redressal S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11 other connected writ petitions ( See
Schedule) Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum
& Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 Commission are bad in law and deserve to be quashed.
(ii) That neither the complainant is a `consumer' as defined in Section 2(d) of the Act nor the
petitioner - JDA is a `trader' or `service provider' as defined under Section 2(q) of the Act, nor any
service has been provided to the complainant as defined under Section 2(o) of the Act and,
therefore, the complaint filed under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act was not
maintainable and this issue having not been decided by the State Commission, this Court in the
present writ petitions can decide these questions and same deserve to be decided in favour of
petitioner JDA.
(iii) That the alternative remedy by way of civil suit for possession could be availed by the
complainant and in execution of decree only he could get the possession from third party, if it was
found that he was in possession of the said land and resort could not be made to the Consumer
Protection Act, 1986.
(iv) That prayer of allotment of alternative plot could not be simply made at all by the complainant,
as there was a clear stipulation S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11 other connected
writ petitions ( See Schedule) Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State Consumer
Disputes Redressal Forum & Ors.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1047990/ 6Jodhpur Development Autho., ... vs State Consumer Disp. Red. Forum & ... on 11 October, 2011
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 in the Resolution dated 9/1/1997 that in case the allottee does not want to
accept the allotment, he may seek the refund of his money for said plot and, therefore, the District
Forum has erred in directing the allotment of alternative plot of land to the respondent
complainant.
(v) That the petitioner - JDA was only bound to provide the necessary cooperation and support to
the complainant-lessee, if he avails legal remedy for removal of encroachment and petitioner JDA is
not bound in law to remove such encroachment and since in the said area `Kachhi Basti' known as
`Rajiv Gandhi Kachhi Basti' has come up in which around 3000 poor people are living, it is not
possible for the petitioner JDA to remove such encroachments and handover the vacant possession
of the plot of land in question to the complainant and, therefore, the execution as directed by the
District Forum and State Commission cannot be undertaken and no damages could have been
awarded against the employees of Jodhpur Development Authority to be recovered from their
salaries. CONTENTIONS OF RESPONDENT ALLOTTEES S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.

Judgment dt: 11/10/2011
15. On the other hand, Mr. Himanshu Maheshwari, learned counsel appearing for the
respondent-complainant vehemently submitted as under:
(i) That the issue regarding coverage of complainant and petitioner - JDA by the provisions of
Consumer Protection Act, 1986 stands concluded by the Apex Court of the country with the
dismissal of SLP against the order of National Commission in the case of Jodhpur Development
Authority vs. Laxman Khetani, who is similarly situated person of the same scheme and in the same
locality & even by series of other judgments cited hereinafter and, therefore, this issue cannot be
reopened in the present writ petition.
(ii) In the alternative, he urged that the petitioner JDA/ UIT, Jodhpur is undoubtedly a `service'
provider to the extent of taking a surrender of title by allottees under the residential colony schemes
framed by it for `Samanvay Nagar' and `Shyam Nagar' and then allotting such plots and taking full
price thereof @ Rs. 560/- per sq.mtr. & of which possession after proper demarcation, identification
with the removal of the encroachments, if any, was to be given by the JDA/UIT to the complainant.
The JDA/UIT has a statutory obligation S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11 other
connected writ petitions ( See Schedule) Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State
Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum & Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 of removal of encroachments of persons without any right, title or interest
and handover the vacant and peaceful possession of the allotted plot of land to the complainant
respondent and it cannot refuse to do so nor it can abdicate the same function to the allottee himself
as it has power as well as legal obligation to do so under Section 67 of the JDA Act, 2009 as well as
under the old UIT Act.

(iii) Mr. Himanshu Maheshwari also submitted that in other writ petitions also in PIL jurisdiction as
well as learned Single Judge of this Court have directed time and again the petitioner JDA/ UIT to
remove the encroachment in the form of `Rajiv Gandhi Kachhi Basti' from these two residential
localities known as `Samanvay Nagar' and `Shyam Nagar' existing on the aforesaid land but it is
surprising that JDA being a Public Body instead of complying with the directions of this Court is
contesting the said position and has simply refused to abide by these directions despite having lost
at all the judicial forums including upto Supreme Court, as aforesaid.
(iv) Learned counsel for the respondent complainant also submitted that since the lease land which
vested in the UIT/JDA is S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11 other connected writ
petitions ( See Schedule) Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State Consumer Disputes
Redressal Forum & Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 also `goods' as defined under Section 2(i) of the Act of 1986 which refers
to the definition of Sale of Goods Act and since JDA deals with the said plot of land as goods sold in
the trade or its `stock' of land bank, therefore, the petitioner JDA is not only a `service provider'
which is a widely defined term under Section 2(o) of the Act but it can also be construed to be
`trader' dealing with `goods' and on account of defective `goods' or `defect in services', the District
Forum and the State Commission have rightly directed the Jodhpur Development Authority either
to handover the vacant possession of the plot of land to the complainant and also to pay damages
and in the alternative to allot alternative plot of land to the complainant on the same terms.
16. I have heard the learned counsels at length, perused the record of the case, relevant provisions of
the enactments and the judgments cited at the bar.
17. The principal contention raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner JDA, Mr. M.C.Bhoot,
that the Consumer Protection Act is not applicable to the petitioner in the present case as the
complainant S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11 other connected writ petitions ( See
Schedule) Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum
& Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 was not a `consumer' nor the Jodhpur Development Authority was a
`service provider' was negatived and concluded against the petitioner JDA in the judgments relied
upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner himself.
CASE LAWS RELIED UPON BY PETITIONER JDA/UIT DISCUSSED
18. Mr. M.C.Bhoot relied upon the decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of UT Chandigarh
Administration & anr. vs. Amarjeet Singh & ors- (2009) 4 SCC 660,in which relying upon the
previous decision in the case of Municipal Corporation, Chandigarh vs. Shantikunj Investment (P)
Ltd. (2006) 4 SCC 109, the Apex Court has distinguished the two types of development and
allotment of sites for the purpose of housing colonies and the Hon'ble Apex Court has held that
where a public development authority invites the applications for allotment of sites in a lay out to be
formed or for houses to be constructed and delivered, fails to deliver possession by forming the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1047990/ 8Jodhpur Development Autho., ... vs State Consumer Disp. Red. Forum & ... on 11 October, 2011
layout of sites or by constructing the houses within the stipulated period, the delay may amount to a
deficiency in service by S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11 other connected writ
petitions ( See Schedule) Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State Consumer Disputes
Redressal Forum & Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 treating the development authority as a service provider and the allottee as
the consumer. On the other hand, in an existing site where such land or plot of land as an
immovable property is put up for sale or lease by public auction by the owner (including private
residential colony developers) and the sale/lease is confirmed in favour of the highest bidder, the
resultant contract relates to sale or lease of immovable property and there is no hiring or availing of
services by the person bidding at the auction nor the seller or lessor, a trader who sells or distributes
`goods' and, therefore, while the first category would be covered by the provisions of Consumer
Protection Act, the second category would not be so covered. To extract the relevant portion from
para 19 from the decision of Apex court in UT Chandigarh Administration & anr. vs. Amarjeet Singh
& ors (supra) would be useful:
"Where a developer carries on the activity of development of land and invites
applications for allotment of sites in a developed layout, it will amount to `service',
that when possession of the allotted site is not delivered within the stipulated period,
the delay may amount to a deficiency or denial of service, and S.B.CIVIL WRIT
PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11 other connected writ petitions ( See Schedule)
Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State Consumer Disputes Redressal
Forum & Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 that any claim in regard to such delay is not in regard to the immovable
property but in regard to the deficiency in rendering service of a particular standard, quality or
grade. The activity of a developer, that is development of land into layout of sites, inviting
applications for allotment by assuring formation of a lay out with amenities and delivery of the
allotted sites within a stipulated time at a particular price, is completely different from the auction of
existing sites either on sale or lease. In a scheme for development and allotment, the allottee has no
choice of the site allotted. He has no choice in regard to the price to be paid. The development
authority decides which site should be allotted to him. The development authority fixes the uniform
price with reference to the size of plots. In most development schemes, the applications are invited
and allotments are made long before the actual development of the lay out or formation of sites.
Further the development scheme casts an obligation on the development authority to provide
specified amenities. (The present case falls in this category).Alternatively the developer represents
that he would provide certain amenities, in the Brochure or advertisement. In a public auction of
sites, the position is completely different. A person interested can inspect the sites offered and
choose the S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11 other connected writ petitions ( See
Schedule) Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum
& Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 site which he wants to acquire and participate in the auction only in regard
to such site. Before bidding in the auction, he knows or is in a position to ascertain, the condition
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1047990/ 9Jodhpur Development Autho., ... vs State Consumer Disp. Red. Forum & ... on 11 October, 2011
and situation of the site. He knows about the existence or lack of amenities. The auction is on `as is
where is basis'. With such knowledge, he participates in the auction and offers a particular bid.
There is no compulsion that he should offer a particular price. When the sites auctioned are existing
sites, without any assurance/representation relating to amenities, there is no question of deficiency
of service or denial of service. Where the bidder has a choice and option in regard to the site and
price and when there is no assurance of any facility or amenity, the question of the owner of the site
becoming a service provider, does not arise."
19. Similarly, in Secretary, Bhubaneshwar Development Authority vs. Susanta Kumar Misra -
(2009) 4 SCC 684, the Hon'ble Apex Court held that any fora under the Consumer Protection Act,
1986 before granting any relief to a complainant, should be satisfied that the complaint relates to
any of the matters specified in Section 2(1) ( c ) of the Act and that the complainant has alleged and

Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 made out either unfair or restrictive trade practice by a trader, or defects
in the goods sold, or any deficiency in a service rendered and upholding the liability to pay interest
by the lessee, the Court concluded that a lessee signs without protest an agreement agreeing to pay
interest at a given rate from a given date in given circumstances and does not contend that the term
relating to installments or interest is invalid or inequitable, it is not open to the Consumer Forum to
grant any relief.
20. In the earlier decision in the case of Municipal Corporation, Chandigarh vs. Shantikunj
Investment (P) Ltd. (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that in a case where the private party
contends that since under Rule 12 (2) of the Chandigarh Lease-hold of Sites and Building Rules,
1973, the first installment fell due one year after the date of allotment, the said rule should be
construed to mean that there was an implied covenant that the authorities would provide all
necessary amenities in the meantime, which according to complainant included the roads, water
supply, etc. and, therefore, since such amenities were not provided, the allottee did not pay the
installment due to be paid, negativing the contention of the complainant allottee, S.B.CIVIL WRIT

Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum & Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the allottees could not take upon
themselves not to pay the lease amount and take recourse to say that since all the facilities were not
provided, they were not under any obligation to pay the installment, interest and penalty, if any, as
provided under the Act and the Rules since providing of all the facilities or amenities were never the
condition precedent. The Apex Court, however, allowed the High court, where the matter was
remanded back, that since some of the sectors have been fully developed and some sectors have
been less developed and it is not possible to work out the factual matrix, the High Court may grant
the allottees the proportionate relief for the sectors for which facilities like kutcha road, drainage,
drinking water, sewerage, street lighting have not been provided.

21. In the present case before this Court, it is beyond pale of doubt that the allotment made in favour
of respondent complainant was not in the nature of sale of plot of land in an existing site by the
developer in a public auction where such sites could be examined by the intending bidder and upon
public auction held on `as-is-where-is basis', if they are purchasing such plot of land with open eyes,

Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 cannot raise any grievance about not giving the possession within the time
schedule. On the other hand, the petitioner JDA itself knew that there are encroachments on the
land in question, still the lands were required to be surrendered by the title holders and 20-25%
lesser land was allotted back to such applicants upon payment of price to be fixed by the UIT/JDA
and a proper layout plan was to be prepared and possession of such land in question was required to
be given to such allottees after removal of encroachments & demarcation of plots and allottees were
further required to complete the construction within a period of five years from the date of
demarcation of exact plot of land and giving of vacant possession. Therefore, this kind of
development of land and allotment of plots clearly fell within the first category of cases as held by
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of UT Chandigarh Administration vs. Amarjeet Singh (supra)
and, therefore, there is no shadow of doubt in the present case that JDA would be covered within the
ambit and scope of Consumer Protection Act as a `service provider' and the complainant would be a
`consumer' and, thus, applicability of the Consumer Protection Act in the present case is
unequivocal and clear.

22. Moreover, this issue having been raised by the petitioner JDA/UIT before the State Commission,
National Commission and Supreme Court of India in one of these matters in the case of Laxman
Khetani, as aforesaid, and with the dismissal of SLP No. 499437/2010 (Jodhpur Development
Authority vs. Laxman Khetani) on 6/9/2010 against the judgment of National Commission dated
15/4/2010 in Revision Petition no.4161/2009, this issue is not even open for the JDA to be raised
before this Court. In fact, this court could not have been called upon to decide this issue once the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in one of the group matters has already concluded the same by dismissal of
SLP, however, even upon examination of this question on merits, this Court, in view that aforesaid
Supreme Court decision in UT Chandigarh vs. Amarjeet Singh, is of the clear view that provisions of
the Consumer Protection Act did apply and were rightly applied to the present case.
23. Now coming to the merits of the contentions raised before the fora under the Consumer
Protection Act and this Court that in view of the condition in the resolution dated 9/1/1997-Ex.1 that

Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 allotted/leased plot of land and JDA/UIT would only cooperate in the
matter and, therefore, for failure to give vacant & peaceful possession of the land after demarcation
of the plot of land after removal of encroachment, the same did not amount to deficiency in service
on the part of the UIT/JDA, this Court is of the clear opinion that such a condition itself in the
Resolution dated 9/1/1997 was void and against the public policy and cannot be enforced against the
complainants in view of the statutory as well as contractual obligation upon the UIT/JDA to remove
such encroachments by rank trespassers and clearly demarcate and identify the plot of land in
question and then handover the vacant & peaceful possession of the same to allottees/complainants.
It may be noted here that the complainants had surrendered their title documents of the land in
favour of the JDA/UIT and land of lesser measurement was allotted to them & that too upon
payment of price or premium fixed by the UIT/JDA, which admittedly was paid by the complainants
but the UIT/JDA has failed to remove the encroachment of `kachhi Basti' known as `Rajiv Gandhi
Kachhi Basti' from the said land and after clear demarcation and identification, the plots of land
were never handed over to the complainant-respondents. In the face of the same, filing of the

Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 complaint in the present case for defective services provided by the
UIT/JDA was perfectly justified and the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum and State
Commission cannot be faulted in giving the relief to the complainants and directing the UIT/JDA to
either hand over the vacant and peaceful possession of the assigned & allotted plot of land or in the
alternative to allot and handover alternative plot of land of same size in the same locality, at the
same price and also to pay compensation and damages.
24. Section 67 of the Jodhpur Development Authority Act, 2009 clearly provides for removal of
encroachment on the public land and makes it a cognizable offence, punishable with not less than
one month and upto two years of imprisonment and fine which may extend to Rs. 20,000/-.
Sub-section (3) of Section 67 clearly empowers the JDA or any officer authorized by it in this behalf
to remove any such obstruction or encroachment and the expenses of such removal shall be paid by
the person who had caused the said obstruction or encroachment. The said provision even provides
for attachment of property found on such land and confiscation thereof.

25. In view of these provisions, it is undeniable that there was a statutory obligation on the part of

EARLIER ORDERS OF THIS COURT

26. As a matter of fact, this Court in some of the writ petitions in PIL jurisdiction and otherwise have
directed on number of occasions the petitioner - JDA/UIT to remove such encroachments of rank
trespassers for this very case of encroachments and it would be appropriate to reproduce one such
order given in Writ petition no. 6172/2006 - Rajiv Gandhi Colony Hitkari Samiti & Ors. vs. State of
Rajasthan & Ors. dated 29/4/2010 :
"It is made clear that if such litigations on the basis of title of the persons, are
pending in the court of law or have been decided against the UIT/JDA, obviously till
such litigations take final shape, such plaintiffs or decree holders cannot be removed
from S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11 other connected writ
petitions ( See Schedule) Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State
Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum & Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 the land in question to the extent of area of the land over which there is
evidence of title in their favour. However, it is made clear that other than such persons, all persons
who have illegally encroached over the land merely on the basis of his/her so called possession over
the said land, will be treated as rank trespasser and such illegal encroachments deserve to be
removed from the said place immediately. This Court is not inclined to have any misplaced
sympathy with such rank trespassers or encroachees irrespective of the length of their possession
over the land in question while being conscious of the fact that they may be poor people and loss
may be caused to them by such removal from the land in question.
10. It is further made clear except in the cases of litigation or decree against the State/UIT/JDA on
the basis of title of plaintiff, no other stay order of any Court or Tribunal subordinate to High Court
shall come in the way of the respondent- JDA or its officials and other officers of the State in
removing such illegal encroachments, for which this Court has consistently given directions time
and again including the last date i.e. 21.04.2010 in the present case.

Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 officials of the JDA, Jodhpur and other Government Departments who are
directed to work in tandem with JDA, Jodhpur for removal of such encroachments, the directions
have already been given in this regard, and are reiterated and they are expected to be followed with
more vigour and force, if necessary.
14. While referring to the decision dated 24/25.05.2003 of then UIT referred to at page 170 of the
application filed today by the JDA with a report for shifting of these encroachees to an alternative
location has also been framed by the said Trust, however, the learned counsel do not have any such
scheme available with him. He prayed for sometime to produce that also. In the light of this
submission, it is directed that if any such scheme is already available with the JDA, Jodhpur they are
free to shift the illegal encroachees and they may also notify in the local newspaper to this effect that
unless there is a litigation pending with State/JDA on the basis of title over the land as claimed by

27. In a Public Interest Litigation Petition ( D.B.Civil Writ Petition No. 3736/2000 - Jugal Kishore
vs. UIT & Ors.), the Division Bench of this Court dealing with the same colony, namely; Samanvay
Nagar and Shyam Nagar, as is involved in the present case, held as under:-
"The writ petition is alleged to be a public interest litigation by a public minded
citizen for restraining the UIT From parting with the lands placed at its disposal by
the State Government in pursuance of Annexure-2, resolution No.8 dated 9.1.96 and
Annexure-3 resolution No.13 (12) dated 9.1.97 and the Press Note, Annexure-4 for
giving effect to the aforesaid resolution. The contention of the learned counsel for the
petitioner is that the UIT has no authority to pass the resolutions in questions for
fixing the price of the land which has been placed at its disposal in 1978. In doing so,
it is not discharging its functions of developing the land in accordance with the
provisions and objects of Urban Improvement Trust Act, 1959.......
S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11 other connected writ petitions ( See Schedule)
Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum & Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 Having examined the contentions raised before us and perusing the
resolutions, we are of the opinion that it is apparently, we are of the opinion that it is apparently an
attempt by the UIT, Jodhpur to minimise the litigation and to settle the disputes raised by the
persons claiming to be in possession of the land on the basis of their title by requiring them to
surrender the land to the UIT resulting in perfecting the title of UIT and subjecting the occupants to
the title of UIT and in view of settling such disputes without litigation, the claimants who
surrendered such land to UIT, were to be allotted the same land at a price determined under the
resolution. Thus the resolution in terms settles the disputes about the title of the UIT in lieu of
allotting the land to the persons surrendering the claim to title to the UIT and obtaining right
continued possession and is under a title from UIT on payment of a price fixed under the resolution.
The perusal of section 96 of the Urban Improvement Act also leaves no room of doubt that it is not a
pre-condition for settling a dispute that it must be pending before any court. As was suggested by
learned counsel for the petitioner it is enough if there is a bona fide debatable claim, raised by a
claimant to S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11 other connected writ petitions ( See
Schedule) Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum
& Ors.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1047990/ 14Jodhpur Development Autho., ... vs State Consumer Disp. Red. Forum & ... on 11 October, 2011
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 the land in question. In such event the Urban Improvement Trust has
necessary authority to settle such disputes to prevent litigation by securing its own title perfected by
surrender of the and in its favour and in lieu thereof to allot the land, which is not falling within the
zone of specific purpose excluded from Resolution, by the UIT on its own terms.
In these circumstances, we do not see that any question of public interest is involved in adopting the
procedure countenanced by statutory provision. We do not find reference made to any particular
instance of entertaining bogus claims under the guise of existing title in abuse of its authority
conferred through resolutions in questions. If specific instances of abuse of power is brought to
notice the same can be examined but no exercise of groping in dark can be made. The court will not
ordinarily be entertaining petition on vague allegations that such and such resolutions are contrary
to the limits of authority conferred on the UIT. In reply to the petition it has been clearly stated by
the respondent UIT that particularly one of the case which we have referred to above, speaks for
itself about the nature of dispute which was pending litigation and which has been included in the
press-note. Moreover it is the case of S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11 other
connected writ petitions ( See Schedule) Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State
Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum & Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 the respondents and those facts have not been denied that most parcels of
the and under the press note are prone to litigation on account of the long possession held by
different persons claiming title in the land and constructions have come existence for long time, on
such land.
As a result, we do not find any merit in this writ petition and the same is hereby rejected."
28. Thus, the context in which the Division Bench of this court also dealt with the aforesaid PIL
petition and held that the UIT could make such allotment even upon perfecting its title upon
surrendering the title deed by the earlier title holders and allot the same to them, it is clear that not
handing over of the vacant possession of the demarcated plot of land to the complainant
respondents resulted in defective service provided by the UIT/JDA - the `service provider'.
29. Therefore, this Court is of the clear opinion that the said condition in the Resolution dated
9/1/1997 is ultra vires and contrary to its statutory obligation of removal of encroachments and
handover the vacant and peaceful possession of the land to the allottees. In the absence of same, the
directions of District Consumer Disputes S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11 other

Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 Redressal Forum and State Commission under the Act of 1986 to hand
over the alternative plot of land in the same locality also cannot be said to be without jurisdiction
but on the contrary is just and proper.
30. As far as question of damages as awarded by the State Commission is concerned, some of the
case law relied upon by the learned counsel for the complainant, Mr. Himanshu Maheshwari clearly
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1047990/ 15Jodhpur Development Autho., ... vs State Consumer Disp. Red. Forum & ... on 11 October, 2011

INDIAN CASE LAW REGARDING COMPENSATION &
DAMAGES:
31. In Secretary, Thirumurugan Cooperative Agricultural Credit Society vs. M. Lalitha & Ors. -
(2004) 1 SCC 305, the complainant approached the Hon'ble Supreme Court with the following case:
"The respondents, being the members of the appellant-society, had pledged paddy
bags for obtaining loan. The appellant-society issued notices to S.B.CIVIL WRIT
PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11 other connected writ petitions ( See Schedule)
Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State Consumer Disputes Redressal
Forum & Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 the respondents demanding payment of loan amount with
interest thereon. The respondents filed petitions in the District Consumer Disputes
Redressal Forum, Thiruchirapally seeking direction to the appellant to release the
paddy bags pledged on receipt of the loan amount or in the alternative to direct the
appellant to pay the market value of the paddy bags with interest thereon from the
date of pledging till the date of release and also to pass an order for compensation for
mental agony and suffering. The appellant contested the claims of the respondents
before the District Forum raising a preliminary objection that Consumer Forum had
no jurisdiction to decide the dispute between members and cooperative society in
view of Section 90 of the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies Act, 1983."
The Hon'ble Supreme upheld the applicability of Consumer Protection Act 1986 to the Housing
Cooperative Society covered under the provisions of T.N.Cooperative Societies Act, 1983 and held in
para 12,18 & 19 as under:-
"12. Having due regard to the scheme of the Act and purpose sought to be achieved to
protect the interest of the consumers better, the provisions are to be interpreted
broadly, positively and purposefully in S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010
& 11 other connected writ petitions ( See Schedule) Jodhpur Development Authority,
Jodhpur vs. State Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum & Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 the context of the present case to give meaning to additional/extended
jurisdiction, particularly when Section 3 seeks to provide remedy under the Act in addition to other
remedies provided under other Acts unless there is a clear bar. Under the 1986 Act the court has to
consider as regards the additional jurisdiction conferred on the Consumer Forums and not their
exclusion.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1047990/ 16Jodhpur Development Autho., ... vs State Consumer Disp. Red. Forum & ... on 11 October, 2011
18. The remedies that are available to an aggrieved party under the 1986 Act are wider. For instance
in addition to granting a specific relief the forums under the 1986 Act have jurisdiction to award
compensation for the mental agony, suffering, etc., which possibly could not be given under the Act
in relation to dispute under Section 90 of the Act. Merely because the rights and liabilities are
created between the members and the management of the society under the Act and forums are
provided, it cannot take away or exclude the jurisdiction conferred on the forums under the 1986
Act expressly and intentionally to serve a definite cause in terms of the objects and reasons of the
1986 Act. When the decision of Dhulabhai's case was rendered the provisions similar to 1986 Act
providing additional remedies to parties were neither available nor S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.

Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 considered. If the argument of the learned counsel for the appellant is
accepted it leads to taking away the additional remedies and forums expressly provided under the
1986 Act, which is not acceptable.

House Building Coop. Society, (2003) 2 SCC 412, relied on.
19. If the parties approach both the forums created under the Act and the 1986 Act, the question of
conflict of decisions may not arise. It is for the forum under the 1986 Act to leave the parties either
to proceed or avail the remedies before the other forums, depending on the facts and circumstances
of the case."

"The common characteristics of goods and services are that they are supplied at a
price to cover the costs and generate profit or income for the seller of goods or
provider of services. But the defect in one and deficiency in other may have to be
removed and compensated differently. The former is, normally, capable of being
replaced and repaired whereas the other may be required to be compensated by
award of the just equivalent of the value or damages for loss. 'Goods' have been

defined by clause (i) and have been assigned the same meaning as in Sale of Goods
Act,1930. But the submission that the applicability of the Act having been confined to
movable goods only a complaint filed for any defect in relation to immovable goods
such as a house or building or allotment of site could not have been entertained by
the Commission is not well founded. The consumer respondents were aggrieved
either by delay in delivery of possession of house or use of substandard material etc.
and therefore they claimed deficiency in service rendered by the appellants. The
jurisdiction of the Commission could not be ousted on ground that even though it
was service it related to immovable property.
S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11 other connected writ petitions ( See Schedule)
Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum & Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 The legislative intention is clear to protect a consumer against services
rendered by statutory bodies. The legislature expanded the meaning of the word `service' in Section
2(o) to even such facilities as are available to a consumer in connection with banking, financing etc.
Each of these activities are discharged both by statutory and private bodies. In absence of any
indication, express or implied, there is no reason to hold that authorities created by the statute are
beyond purview of the Act. The test is not if a person against whom complaint is made is a statutory
body but whether the nature of the duty and function performed by it is service or even facility.
The Act requires provider of service to be more objective and care taking. It is still more in public
services. When private undertakings are taken over by the Government or corporations are created
to discharge what is otherwise State's function, one of the inherent objectives of such social welfare
measures is to provide better, efficient and cheaper services to the people. Any attempt, therefore, to
exclude services offered by statutory or officials bodies to the common man would be against the
provisions of the Act and spirit behind it. A government or semi-government body or a local
authority is as much amenable to the Act as any other S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010
& 11 other connected writ petitions ( See Schedule) Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs.
State Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum & Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 private body rendering similar service.
Construction of a house or flat is for the benefit of person for whom it is constructed. He may do it
himself or hire services of a builder or contractor. The latter being for consideration is service as
defined in the Act. Similarly when a statutory authority develops land or allots a site or constructs a
house for the benefit of common man it is as much service as by a bidder or contractor. The one is
contractual service and other statutory service. If the service is defective or it is not what was
represented then it would be unfair trade practice as defined in the Act. Any defect in construction
activity would be denial of comfort and service to a consumer. When possession of property is not
delivered within stipulated period the delay so caused is denial of service. Such disputes or claims
are not in respect of immovable property as argued but deficiency in rendering of service of
particular standard, quality or grade. Such deficiencies or omissions are defined in sub-clause (ii) or
clause (r ) of Section 2 as unfair trade practice. If a builder of a house uses substandard material in

33. While dealing with the accountability of public authorities for their arbitrary and even ultra vires
actions, the Hon'ble Supreme Court upholding the compensation awarded against such Housing
Cooperative Society by the fora under the Consumer Protection Act, held in para no.5 and 8 in case
of Lucknow Development Authority vs. M.K.Gupta (supra) as under:-
"8. The administrative law of accountability of public authorities for their arbitrary
and even ultra vires actions has taken many strides. It is now accepted that the State
is liable to compensate for loss or injury suffered by a citizen due to arbitrary actions
of its employees. It is not necessary, `to consider whether there is any rational
dividing line between the so-called sovereign and proprietary or commercial
functions for determining the liability of the State'. In any case the law has always
maintained that the public authorities who are entrusted with statutory function
cannot act negligently. Under our S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11
other connected writ petitions ( See Schedule) Jodhpur Development Authority,
Jodhpur vs. State Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum & Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 Constitution sovereignty vests in the people. Every limb of the
constitutional machinery is obliged to be people oriented. No functionary in exercise of statutory
power can claim immunity, except to the extent protected by the statute itself. Public authorities
acting in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions oppressively are accountable for their
behavior before authorities created under the statute like the commission or the courts entrusted
with responsibility of maintaining the rule of law. Each hierarchy in the Act is empowered to
entertain a complaint by the consumer for value of the goods or services and compensation.
5. This takes us to the larger issue if the public authorities under different enactments are amenable
to jurisdiction under the Act. It was vehemently argued that the local authorities or government
bodies develop land and construct houses in discharge of their statutory function, therefore, they
could not be subjected to the provisions of the Act. The learned counsel urged that if the ambit of the

protect a consumer against malpractices in
business. The argument proceeded on complete
misapprehension of the purpose of Act and even its explicit language. In fact the Act requires
provider of service to be more objective and care taking. It is still more so in public services. When
private undertakings are taken over by the Government or corporations are created to discharge
what is otherwise State's function, one of the inherent objectives of such social welfare measures is
to provide better, efficient and cheaper services to the people. Any attempt, therefore, to exclude
services offered by statutory or official bodies to the common man would be against the provisions
of the Act and the spirit behind it."
ENGLISH CASE LAW ON COMPENSATION & DAMAGES
34. Now certain references to English Law on the compensation under the Torts law can also be
discussed in the context of present case.
Compensation includes both the just equivalent for loss of goods or services and also for sufferance
of injustice. In a case S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11 other connected writ
petitions ( See Schedule) Jodhpur Development Authority, Jodhpur vs. State Consumer Disputes
Redressal Forum & Ors.
Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 where the Commission directed the Bangalore Development Authority to
pay Rs.2446 to the consumer for the expenses incurred by him in getting the lease-cum-sale
agreement registered as it was additional expenditure for alternative site allotted to him. No
misfeasance was found. The moment the authority came to know of the mistake committed by it, it
took immediate action by alloting alternative site to the respondent. It was compensation for exact
loss suffered by the respondent. It arose in due discharge of duties. For such acts or omissions the
loss suffered has to be made good by the authority itself. But when the sufferance is due to malafide
or oppressive or capricious acts etc. of a public servant, then the nature of liability changes. The
Commission under the Act could determine such amount if in its opinion the consumer suffered
injury due to what is called misfeasance of the officers by the English Courts. Even in England where
award of exemplary or aggravated damages for insult etc. to a person has now been held to be
punitive, exception has been carved out if the injury is due to, 'oppressive, arbitrary or
unconstitutional action by servants of the Government' (Salmond and Heuston on the Law of Torts).
Misfeasance in public office is explained by Wade in his book on Administrative Law thus:

Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 Even where there is no ministerial duty as above, and even where no
recognized tort such as trespass, nuisance, or negligence is committed, public authorities or officers
may be liable in damages for malicious, deliberate or injurious wrong-doing. There is thus a tort
which has been called misfeasance in public office, and which includes malicious abuse of power,
deliberate maladministration,and perhaps also other unlawful acts causing injury.

Lord Hailsham in Cassell & Co. Ltd. v. Broome (1972 AC 1027) on the principle that, an award of
exemplary damages can serve a useful purpose in vindicating the strength of law'. An ordinary
citizen or a common man is hardly equipped to match the might of the State or its instrumentalities.
That is provided by the rule of law. It acts as a check on arbitrary and capricious exercise of power.
In Rookes v. Barnard (1964 AC 1129) it was observed by Lord Devlin, 'the servants of the
government are also the servants of the people and the use of their power must always be
subordinate to their duty of service'. A public functionary if he acts maliciously or oppressively and
the exercise of power results in harassment and S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 11316/2010 & 11

protection against it. He who is responsible for it must suffer it.
In Farrington vs. Thomson (1959 UR 286) the Supreme Court of Victoria awarded damages for
exercising a power the authorities knew they did not possess. A licensing inspector and a police
officer ordered the plaintiff to close his hotel and cease supplying liquor. He obeyed and filed a suit
for the resultant loss. The Court observed:
""Now I take it to be perfectly clear, that if a public officer abuses his office, either by
an act of omission or commission, and the consequence of that is an injury to an
individual, an action may be maintained against such public officer."
In Wood v. Blair (The Times, July 3, 4, 5, 1957 [Hallet J & Court of Appeal] a dairy farmer's
manageress contracted typhoid fever and the local authority served notices forbidding him to sell
milk, except under certain conditions. These notices were S.B.CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.

were invalid and that the plaintiff was entitled to damages for misfeasance. This was done even
though the finding was that the officers had acted from the best motives.
35. It is unfortunate that matters which require immediate attention linger on and the man in the
street is made to run from one end to other with no result. The culture of window clearance appears
to be totally dead. Even in ordinary matters a common man who has neither the political backing
nor the financial strength to match the inaction in public oriented departments gets frustrated and it
erodes the credibility in the system. Public administration, no doubt involves a vast amount of
administrative discretion which shields the action of administrative authority. But where it is found
that exercise of discretion was mala fide and the complainant is entitled to compensation for mental
and physical harassment then the officer can no more claim to be under protective cover. When a
citizen seeks to recover compensation from a public authority in respect of injuries suffered by him
for capricious exercise of power and the Consumer Forum finds it duly proved then it has a statutory

36. Similarly, Division Bench of Calcutta High Court in the case of Mandira Mookerjee vs. District
Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum - AIR 2005 Calcutta 108, held as under:
"The flat being an immovable property, may not come within the definition of `goods'
within the meaning of S.2(1) of the 1986 Act to mean, goods as defined in the sale of
Goods Act, 1930. But since the transaction contemplated, though related to
immovable property, consists of various other obligations and performance and
services in relations to thereto comprising series of contracts combined into one, the
property sought to be transferred having an element of immovable property would
not preclude the other part of the contract which may consist of the performances or
services which the writ petitioner or the owner is obliged to perform or provide, the
jurisdiction of the Consumer Forum cannot be excluded."

Judgment dt: 11/10/2011 Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum and the Civil Courts, the Calcutta
High Court observed as under:-
"The Civil Court can try all kinds of suits even then specific forums are created with
specific purpose related to specific matters. There is no bar in establishing parallel
forum or by express or implied provisions to bar the jurisdiction of the Civil Court
through legislation. The legislation of the 1986 Act is a valid piece of legislation
creating specific Forum for specific purpose in relation to specific matters. The Court
is not supposed to limit the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the wisdom of the
legislature unless it offends any statute or some other law. We are, however, of the
view that these provisions of 1986 Act do not offend any statute or any other law. Our
attention has not been drawn to any such situation. On the other hand, Section 3 of
the 1986 Act provides that the provisions of the said Act shall be in addition to and
not in derogation of the provisions of any other law."
37. This Court respectfully agrees with the aforesaid views of English Courts, Apex Court of our
country & Calcutta High Court.
