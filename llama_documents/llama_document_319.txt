ORAL JUDGMENT
(PER : HONOURABLE MS. JUSTICE SONIA GOKANI) C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED:
09/12/2022
1.This appeal arises from the judgment and decree passed by the trial Court in Regular Civil Suit
No.2245 of 1998, which resulted in form of the original plaintiff and original defendant.
Factual Matrix:
2. Brief facts in capsulized form are as follow:
2.1 The appellants Nos.1 to 3 are the original defendants and the respondent No.1 is the original
plaintiff. Respondent Nos.2/1 and 2/4 are the heirs of the deceased defendant No.4 and they are
joined after the demise of the original defendant No.4, who is the father of the appellant. Appellants
and respondents shall be referred to as the defendant and plaintiff C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT
DATED: 09/12/2022 respectively for the sake of convenience hereinafter.
2.3 It is the case of the plaintiff that the suit property was purchased in the year 1990 in her name
through power of attorney- the defendant No.1. Because of the good family relations, the plaintiff
with the consultation of her husband Mr.Mayur Sheth (since deceased) permitted all the defendants
including her father-in-law to reside in the said house as defendants did not have personal property
to reside. As and when the plaintiffs visited India, they also resided in the same house.
2.4 In the year 1996, when they visited India on 02.12.1996 to attend the marriage of Manushi, the
daughter of defendant No.1 C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 which was held on
05.12.1996, some news were received by them regarding the alleged transaction that might be
entered by the defendant No.1 regarding the suit property on the basis of the power of attorney
which was given to the defendant No.1. Therefore, on 08.12.1996 a letter was issued to the
defendant No.1 and sent through the simple post cancellilng the power of attoreney. The plaintiff
with her husband had left India on 11.12.1996. On 12.12.1996 and 23.12.1996 they had issued the
Registered A.D. Notice to the defendant No.1 through learned advocate and along with that also, the
very letter issued on 08.12.1996 regarding cancellation of power of attorney was sent.

2.5 Thereafter, on 09.12.1996, the
defendant No.1 is alleged to have
fraudulently executed two registered sale deeds of suit property in favour of defendant Nos.2 and 3,
his wife and son. It is also alleged that the plaintiff had not received any consideration shown in the
sale deed. It is alleged that both the sale deeds are fraudulently made, without the consent of the
plaintiff and therefore, two suits for cancellation of sale deed and to get back the possession from
the defendant No.1 were preferred.
2.6 In the written statement, the defendant No.1 had taken a clear stand that as per the family
settlement between defendant No.4 as the father and karta of C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT
DATED: 09/12/2022 the family with both his sons i.e. defendant No.1 and husband of the plaintiff,
transaction regarding the sale deed in favour of defendant Nos.2 and 3 had taken place. The
defendants also narrated the entire background of the family in detail and pointed out that there
were many family businesses in which the husband of the plaintiff was actively involved. Because of
the financial crunch and the litigation regarding the family business, the family decided to send the
husband of the plaintiff Mr.Mayur Sheth to United States of America so that one member can earn
handsomely and thereafter can help the family. Even the adoption of Mr.Mayur Sheth by his
paternal uncle Mr.Jayantibhai was also a part of the family settlement and it C/FA/1076/2019
JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 is clear that the plaintiff and her husband resided in a joint
family property throughout.

defendant No.2 and 3?
(4) Whether the plaintiff proves that in alternative, he is entitled to recover Rs.60
Lacs from the defendant No.1 along with 20% interest from the date of suit?

JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 in favour of defendant NO.1 was irrevocable and

5. The Court after noticing that all issues are interconnected, to avoid repetition of the reason has
discussed all of them together and eventually answered each one of them and allowed the suit of the
plaintiff and decreed the same. It was declared that the defendant No.1 had no authority under the
power of attorney dated 19.01.1983 to sell the suit property to defendant Nos.2 and 3 as has been
done by C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 him with a further declaration that the
plaintiff being the true and lawful owner of the suit property, continued to be the owner despite of
the sale deed executed by the defendant No.1 in favour of defendant Nos.2 and 3. It is further
declared that the sale effected by the defendant No.1 in favour of the defendant No.2 for half of the
portion of suit property by registered conveyance deed dated 09.12.1996 is illegal, unauthorized and
without any have been directed to handover the vacant and peaceful possession of the suit property
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43814866/ 5Prakash Babulal Sheth vs Shashikalal Mayur Sheth on 9 December, 2022
to the plaintiff within a period of three months. The further transfer of the property in any mode of
manner has been also particularly prohibited. This has C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED:
09/12/2022 aggrieved the defendants, who are before this Court by way of this present first appeal.
6. We have heard the learned advocates, Mr.Jigar Raval with Mr.Vasim Mansuri for the appellant
and learned senior advocate, Mr.Mihir Joshi with learned advocate, Mr.Salil Thakore for the
defendant No.1 and learned advocate, Mr.Vaibhav Goswami represented the defendant Nos.2.2 to
2.4. They have also given their written submissions and substantiated their version with case laws
decided by the Court. There may not be requirement of reproduction of the submissions, it would
suffice to note down the authorities submitted by both the sides.
C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 6.1 On behalf of the defendants, reliance is
placed on the following decisions: (1) State of Rajasthan and others vs. Basant Nahata, reported in

C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022
7. On the strength of the submissions as well as the evidence oral as well as documentary which have
come on the record, the issues which had been framed by the Court will need to be regarded.
Issue No.1: Ownership.
7.1 Issue No.1 is as to whether the plaintiff is the owner of the suit property is concerned, which is
answered in affirmation by the trial Court.
7.2 The property is situated at Sub-plot No.2-A of Final Plot No.795 of Ellisbridge, sq.yard i.e. 481
square meters of area on which the bungalow is constructed which shall be referred to as the suit
property. 7.3 It appears that the defendant No.1 is a C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED:
09/12/2022 son of defendant No.4 Babulal Laxmichand Sheth and defendant No.2 is the son of
defendant No.1 and defendant No.3 is the wife of defendant No.1. Plaintiff is the wife of the brother
of the defendant No.1. Mr.Mayur Sheth and thus, husband of the plaintiff and defendant No.1 are
the real brothers and Mr.Babulal Laxmichand Sheth is the father-in-law of plaintiff. The plaintiff
and her husband are residing abroad. It is the say of the family that they went abroad so that they
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43814866/ 6Prakash Babulal Sheth vs Shashikalal Mayur Sheth on 9 December, 2022
can earn for the family and the family can prosper. According to the plaintiff, as she and her
husband are residing abroad, there was a need for giving power of attorney to defendant No.1 for
managing the bungalow as he is the sibling of her husband and the C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT
DATED: 09/12/2022 same was given on 19.01.1983 to manage the property. The power of attorney
had been executed on 05.01.1983 before the notary public Mr.B.F.Ujjaini where powers were given
by the husband of the plaintiff to the defendant No.1. It is a matter of record and not being disputed
that the suit property was purchased by the plaintiff from Mrs.Saralaben Hasmukhbhai Shah,
Mr.Sunil Hasmukhbhai Shah, Miss Sonia Hasmukhbhai Shah and Miss Bela Hasmukhbhai Shah by
a deed of conveyance on 08.02.1990 for a total consideration of Rs.16,50,000/-.
7.4 Defendant No.1 as the constituted attorney of the plaintiff had also got the names of the plaintiff
and her husband C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 mutated in the Government
Record. It appears that another original supplementary agreement of sale Exhibit 194 which was
executed by those very owners in favour of the plaintiff on 14.12.1989 with regard to the suit
property and the period of agreement dated 13.09.1989 had been extended upto 31.01.1990 as the
vendors were not in a position to handover the suit property to the purchaser. The plaintiff had
produced the registration fees receipt No.557015 and thus, it is clear that the property had been
purchased by the plaintiff in the year 1989.
7.5 From the Tax Receipt, Municipal Corporation Tax Bills and various other documentary
evidences from the Government C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 and Municipal
Corporation would reveal that suit property was purchased by the plaintiff and her husband and
defendant Nos.1, 2 and 3, who are residing in the suit property and plaintiff and her husband since
were residing in USA, whenever they visited India, they would also reside with the family as the
relationships were very cordial.
7.6 The Court on the strength of the registration receipt issued by the Sub- Registrar vide Exhibit 211
and all other documents including the Index Copy of Registration issued by the Sub-Registrar vide
Exhibit 212 has rightly and unequivocally held that the suit property is owned by the plaintiff and
her husband.
C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 7.7 The plaintiff has brought on the record the
income tax return of various years jointly filed by the plaintiff and her husband in USA vide Exhibit
115 to 118.
It appears that these returns are
indicative of their income in USA which
they are handsomely earned in USA. The
certified copy of the letter issued by
Charles J.Prathhas Principal Hellam Version and Company has reflected the income through loan of
plaintiff and her husband. Certified copy of the letter issued by Mr.Shailesh Shah stated that he had
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43814866/ 7Prakash Babulal Sheth vs Shashikalal Mayur Sheth on 9 December, 2022
wired 1,00,000 Pounds on 30.01.1990 to the plaintiff and her husband at Commerce Bank of
Washington in USA vide Exhibit 103. 7.8 The plaintiff has brought on the C/FA/1076/2019
JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 record the certificate of foreign inward remittance issued by the
Andra Bank (Exhibit 107). The remittance of the foreign currency in US $6000/- through DD
No.11019 on 29.08.1989 from the Bank of India to San Francisco USA is also on record. The
permission issued by the Reserve Bank of India under Section 31(1) of the Foreign Exchange
Regulation Act, 1973 ('the FERA' Act hereinafter) to acquire immovable property in India dated
28.12.1989 also is indicative of the fact that the purchase of the suit property is made in December
1989 through the Foreign Currency. The valuation report in respect of the suit property as approved
by the Government Registered valuer is also on record vide Exhibit 131. Mr.Paras Rangwala
C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 also has deposed vide Exhibit 124 that the suit
property was constructed in the year 1983-1984 and in the year 1996, the total value of the suit
property was around Rs.60,26,000/-. It is in a posh locality of Ahmedabad and the value of the
same was Rs.60,26,000/- in the year 1996.
7.9 As a US citizen, the plaintiff needed to seek permission of Reserve Bank of India under Section
31 of the FERA Act which has come on record. Even the permission for selling the property under
Section 31(1) of the FERA Act was necessary as the person who is not the Indian citizen, even for
transfer of such property the Reserve Bank permission is necessary. However, that aspect would be
dilated while coming other C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 issues.
7.10 It is thus more than clear and got established that the plaintiff Shasikala Mayur Sheth is the
owner of the suit property and hence, there is no requirement for any interference so far as the issue
No.1 is concerned.
8. This brings this Court to the Issue No.2, 3 and 4 with regard to the sale made by the defendant
No.1 of the property in question in his capacity as power of attorney to defendant Nos.2 and 3 his
own wife and son on 09.12.1986 and whether the same is without the authority!! And whether the
defendant is entitled to the possession of the property because of the family understanding of the
parties!! C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 8.1 The major & principal grievance
on the part of the plaintiff is in respect of this sale, which had been made by the defendant No.1 in
favour of defendant Nos.2 and 3. It appears that in December 1996, when the plaintiff and her
husband visited India in a normal course, they had stayed at the property owned by them and which
was otherwise used by defendant No.1 and his family. The plaintiff got suspicious about the activity
of the defendant No.1 and therefore, communication was sent to the defendant No.1 to cancel the
power of attorney dated 08.12.1996 through M/s.C.C.Gandhi and Company and thus, the original
power of attorney was cancelled by the plaintiff as per his say.
C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 8.2 After the receipt of the letter, the defendant
No.1 on 09.12.1996 executed two sale deeds in favour of defendant Nos.2 and 3 his son and the wife
for their own benefit. It appears that the plaintiff and her husband were in India from 02.12.1996 to
11.12.1996. The passports of plaintiff and her husband Exhibit 113 and 114 are on record. Visa stamp
by the US Government and the Indian Government are indicative of the fact that they were in India
from 02.12.1996 to 11.12.1996.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43814866/ 8Prakash Babulal Sheth vs Shashikalal Mayur Sheth on 9 December, 2022
8.3 The Court must also take a note of the fact that in the written statement itself the defendant had
taken a stand of oral understanding where the plaintiff's husband had agreed to provide for a house,
purchase C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 price of the same was Rs.16.50 Lakh
and additional money of Rs.50 Lakh to defendant No.1.
8.4 A heavy reliance is placed on the written statement and the letter of defendant No.4 Mr.Babulal
Sheth the father of defendant No.1 and plaintiff's father- in-law. Defendant No.4' written statement
is similar to the written statement of defendant No.1. So far as the letter dated 02.03.1998 of
defendant No.4 is concerned, is not an exhibited document. Moreover, the letter is not referred to in
defendant No.4's written statement nor was it produced by the defendant No.4 in the suit. However,
in a list dated 07.01.2010/ 11.02.2010 after about 11 years of filing C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT
DATED: 09/12/2022 of the suit, the same had been produced. The defendant No.4 has not stepped
into the witness box.
8.5 From the year 2005 onwards, as per the cross examination of defendant No.1, he was living
separately in a flat at Paldi. He lived with defendant No.4 from 1999 to 2005 then he lived in a flat
opposite Dharnidhar Derasar. He passed away in the year 2019 and thus he lived separately from
defendant No.1 for the last about 15 years.
8.6 Worthwhile also would be to consider the contention of the defendant No.1 that cancelled power
of attorney letter dated 08.12.1996 is not exhibited and therefore, cannot be looked into by the
Court, this includes the plaintiff's letter dated C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022
23.12.1996 (Exhibit 144). It is not in dispute that the plaintiff's letter which canceles the power of
attorney is already exhibited and the cancelled power of attorney can be looked into in plaintiff's
cross examination, the same is put to the plaintiff by defendant No.1 and thus, the same has been
referred to during the cross examination and therefore also there will be a need to look into the
same.
8.7 It is thus not about the Court having relied upon the letter dated 08.12.1996 in respect of the
legality of sell, however, while discussing all the issues simultaneously it has taken note of basic
principle of agency and fiduciary relationship which necessiates that the C/FA/1076/2019
JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 power of attorney given in a trust requires to be used for benefit
of the principal and not for the benefit of oneself or the relative. The cencellation of power of
attorney is one of the grounds noted by the Court. However, it has also simultaneously taken note of
the dubious nature of the transaction in favour of the wife and son of defendant No.1 without the
consent of the principal as also the absence of any consideration not to talk about the valuation as
per the report of the Government Approved Valuer.
8.8 Noticing the fact that the operation of Bank Account by the power of attorney himself and the
transactions shrouded with suspicion and ambiguities. Let the Court to C/FA/1076/2019
JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 refer to the fact that the plaintiff was in India when the sale deed
was executed in favour of close relative of defendant No.1 his wife and his son.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43814866/ 9Prakash Babulal Sheth vs Shashikalal Mayur Sheth on 9 December, 2022
8.9 In the opinion of this Court, the sale deed has been set aside on various grounds and not only on
the ground of cancellation of power of attorney. Even otherwise, Order XLI Rule 27 of the Code of
Civil Procedure permits the Court to confirm the decree on the grounds other than those on which
the Civil Court has passed the decree. The Appellate Court has in various decisions emphasised that
the remand should be the last resort as that has a tendency of causing undesirable delay and
prejudice to the party.
C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 8.10 So far as the cancellation of power of
attorney is concerned, it is the defence of the defendant that the learned judge has set aside the sale
deeds only on the ground of cancellation of power of attorney by a letter dated 08.12.1996 and it is
undisputedly made clear that only the grounds appealed is the letter dated 08.12.1996 regarding the
cancellation of power of attorney by the plaintiff before execution of the sale deed on 09.12.1996.
8.11 It is also the defence put-forth that the communication dated 08.12.1996 is not exhibited and
not proved. According to the defendants, at the time of filing the written statement, 15 documents
had been produced vide Exhibit 41. Four documents in C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED:
09/12/2022 original form were produced along with examination in chief (Exhibit 142) with postal
receipts (Exhibit 141). The request is made to the trial Court to exhibit those documents. This
contained the communication by the original defendant No.2 to the plaintiff and her husband on
11.01.1997, a letter dated 18.02.1997 and the third letter by the father-defendant No.4 to the plaintiff
and her husband on 02.03.1998 (list Exhibit 41/1,41/3 and 41/13). They are original
communications which were identified by the defendant in the examination in chief, which ought to
have been executed by the trial Court and taken into consideration. However, when the same has
not been done,there is a need for considering this request afresh and C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT
DATED: 09/12/2022 therefore, the remand of the matter shall be necessary.
8.12 It is also the case of the
defendant No.1 that the father of the
plaintiff-husband defendant No.4 always
felt that it was his responsibility to
settle all the children in different
vocations and certain understanding and
settlement had been arrived at. It was
decided that the husband of the plaintiff and his family were well settled in USA. They should be
separated from defendant No.1 and defendant No.4 would stay with the family of the defendant No.1
along with their mother.
8.13 Thus, family settlement was made orally as per the deposition vide Exhibit C/FA/1076/2019
JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 142 in order to work out the settlement, house was required to be
provided to the defendant No.1 for his children and parents and the amount of Rs.50 Lakh or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43814866/ 10Prakash Babulal Sheth vs Shashikalal Mayur Sheth on 9 December, 2022
equivalent was to be paid by Mr.Mayur Sheth and for that very purpose the power of attorney was
executed on 19.01.1983 and the purchase of the property was as per the understanding of the parties
in the name of the plaintiff as some tax benefit was to be derived from USA and on account of some
litigations pending against the defendant No.4, Mr.Mayur Sheth the brother of the defendant No.1
and the husband of the plaintiff had sent $ 1,00,000/- and the purchase of the property was made in
the name of the plaintiff. This understanding was verbal and hence, the same is not on record.
C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022
9. According to the plaintiff, this is all a story made out after once the defendant No.1 has misused
the power of attorney given to him. The property was not purchased in the name of the plaintiff's
husband Mr.Mayur Sheth, but instead it is purchased in the name of the plaintiff. There is no
document indicating any pending litigation against the defendant No.4. It is also their say that the
property was purchased in the year 1989 for the consideration of Rs.16.50 Lakh whereas the
remittance from the husband of the plaintiff was of Rs.50 Lakh ($ 1,00,000/-), the detail of
remaining amount has not forthcoming.
10. It appears from the deposition of C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 Mr.Paras
Rangwala, who has given the valuation of suit property being a Registered Government Valuer that
he visited the property on 25.03.2009 and value he has assessed in the year 2009 is Rs.60 Lakh.
11. It is necessary to make a mention here that the defendant No.4 Mr.Babulal Laxmichand Sheth,
the father of Mr.Mayur Sheth and defendant No.1 was quite annoyed with the conduct of his son
Mayur and his wife Shasikala Mayur Shah the plaintiff. He therefore, filed an application to be
impleaded as a party respondent, which was allowed by the Court and the same was challenged in
the Revision before the Gujarat High Court which had failed. C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT
DATED: 09/12/2022 11.1 He then filed his written statement at Exhibit 36 stating therein that
Mr.Mayur Sheth was a partner in all the firms run by joint family and hence, he visited India for
more than 18 times. In the year 1996, mother of Mr.Mayur Sheth and Mr.Prakash Sheth, the wife of
the defendant No.4 passed away. Mr.Mayur Sheth had suggested the the bungalow to be sold of
without disturbing the occupancy of the defendant Nos.1 and 4 and the purchase price thereof may
be invested in a manner as would fetch the return equivalent to the expenses as there were
overheads which were not possible to be met with.
11.2 In September 1996, defendant No.3 suggested that he and his family members should not be
allowed to feel that they are C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 a burden as the
bungalow with the occupancy had not been sold. The defendant No.4 continued his occupancy as of
right, and therefore, it was decided that the bungalow should be purchased by one or more of the
family members for the suitable price. After Mr.Mayur Sheth left for USA, the issue was discussed
many a times and phone calls also were made and it was agreed that Mr.Mayur Sheth and his wife
Mrs.Shashikala Sheth that the family members may purchase the property at such price as may be
quoted or agreed by the defendant No.4 as a head of the family and his decision would be binding
upon one and all. The defendant No.1 since had a general power of attorney, the transaction has
been completed even without the presence of the plaintiff and C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43814866/ 11Prakash Babulal Sheth vs Shashikalal Mayur Sheth on 9 December, 2022
DATED: 09/12/2022 Mr.Mayur Sheth and when they were scheduled to visit India in December
1996 to attend the marriage of Manushi, the daughter of defendant No.1, they attended the same on
05.12.1996, when everything was discussed on telephone was refreshed and after the marriage the
papers were completed and in favour of defendant Nos.2 and 3, this registration had been done.
11.3 The plaintiff and Mr.Mayur Sheth were in a hurry to leave India therefore, they requested the
defendant No.1 to complete the transaction as was decided under the guidance of defendant No.4.
He also left it to the discretion of the defendant No.4 to decide the price and hence, the conveyance
was executed. Both C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 defendant Nos.2 and 3 had
paid Rs.10 Lakh as a price of consideration. In the overall interest of the family and as per the wish
of the defendant No.4, this amount was decided to be the amount of consideration. They also had
expressed the wish to send more amount from USA for the betterment of the family. Thus, it was the
say of the defendant No.1 in his deposition that the reason for use of the power of attorney and the
sale of property in question in favour of his wife and son was in this background. The copy of the
sale deed Exhibits 225 and 226 have been produced on record.
11.4. The version puts forth creates a
serious doubt as held by the Court
concerned rightly this wise that if there C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 was an
oral understanding amongst the family members, there was no requirement for the sale deed to be
executed by way of a family settlement or a gift deed, the transfer could have been easily made
possible. The Court cannot be oblivious of the fact that the plaintiff had already issued a notice to
the defendant No.1 for cancellation of power of attorney on 08.12.1996 declaring the power of
attorney as cancelled. He being an agent by virtue of such power of attorney could not have executed
sale deed in favour of his own wife and son by Registration Nos.4474 and 4475 dated 09.12.1996.
11.5 Again, the plaintiff and her husband were in India and they resided with C/FA/1076/2019
JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 the defendant and therefore, there was no earthly reason for
them not to be the part of this transaction. Again, the amount of Rs.20 Lakh, which has been paid by
way of sale consideration by various cheques each of Rs.2 Lakh also has a history for which the Bank
employee was needed to be examined.
12. The defendant No.3 paid Rs.10 Lakh by cheque No.206636, 206637, 206638, 206639 and
206640 on 09.12.1996, each of Rs.2 Lakh. The amount had been deposited in the Bank on
10.12.1996 and on the very day the same had been withdrawn. The defendants did not produce the
Bank Statement of theirs on their own.
12.1 Apt would be to refer here to the C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022
deposition of the Bank employee and the statement of account of Andhra Bank from 10.12.1996 to
05.08.2002 produced by the plaintiff of the account No.S.B.NRO/1/1.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43814866/ 12Prakash Babulal Sheth vs Shashikalal Mayur Sheth on 9 December, 2022
The account holder is plaintiff Mrs.Shashikala Mayur Sheth and account is operated by Mr.Prakash
Babulal Sheth defendant No.1 as a power of attorney holder. Two times Rs.10 Lakh had been
credited in the account on 10.12.1996 by way of transfer and the same was withdrawn on the very
day on 10.12.1996 by self. The defendant No.1 argued that the plaintiff withdrew this amount by self.
Contrary to this submission, it is all along on record that the power of attorney holder defendant
No.1 was operating the account. A copy of ledger and account of statement issued by
C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 the Andhra Bank have also come on the record.
13. The Bank Account of plaintiff in the Bank Statement specifies at the top "General Power of
Attorney Holder; Mr.Prakash B. Sheth". Withdrawal of money by the plaintiff is not even contended
in the written statement. As rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for the plaintiff that the
defendant No.1 had claimed that Mr.Mayur Sheth while leaving India has expressed the desire to
send further amount for the comfort of Mr.Babulal Sheth. If that was his desire, as expressed by the
defendant No.1, it would demolish his case that the plaintiff had withdrawn the money from her
Bank C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 account on 10.12.1996 as on one hand
Mr.Mayur Sheth would be withdrawing this amount of consideration and on the other hand
expressed his desire to send the further amount. Assuming that two could not be correlated, it is also
the say of the defendant No.1 that Mr.Mayur Sheth needed to pay Rs.50 Lakh more as per the oral
family arrangement. Had that been the case and if the plaintiff and her husband has no objection to
such a transfer, there could not have been the withdrawal of Rs.20 Lakh as averred by defendant
No.1.
13.1 Again, as mentioned above so far as sale deed No.4474 is concerned, the amount of
consideration is Rs.10 Lakh by way of five cheques each of Rs.2 Lakh written on C/FA/1076/2019
JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 09.12.1996. However, the sale deed No.4475 indicates that the
amount of Rs.10 Lakh was received by five cheques of Rs.2 Lakh each dated 09.12.1996. In the Bank
Statement instead of 10 cheques of Rs.2 Lakh each, only two credit entries of Rs.20 Lakh each and
no 10 entries of Rs.2 Lakh each is reflected. This also is arising serious doubt about the genuineness
of the transaction. This withdrawal behind the back of the plaintiff and her husband who were very
much in India speaks a volume about the conduct of the parties.
13.2 Again, as per the report of Government Registered and Approved Valuer, Mr.Paras Rangwala
the value was at least of Rs.60 Lakh of the property whereas what has C/FA/1076/2019
JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 been found here is that the sale deeds have been executed
without consideration and if at all the sale consideration has been paid, it is much below what the
market value of the property was.
13.3 Again, the plaintiff being the citizen of USA as discussed above is obligated to seek prior
permission of Reserve Bank before the sale is made by her. No such permission was taken prior to
the sale in the year 1996, which again is in violation of Section 31 of the FERA Act. Any such
transaction without the permission of Reserve Bank would be violative of Section 31 of the FERA
Act.

14. In these circumstances, the Court needs to regard the principle of agency which is
C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 well established and pressed into service for
and on behalf of the respondent- original plaintiff. Agent is not required to use the power of attorney
for his own benefit and if he so does it, the burden of proving that this transaction was made in a
good way and is fair and reasonable would always be on a person who claims the same to be a
genuine transaction. Otherwise also, it is for the agent to establish that the action was with the
consent of the principal and the price paid was of a full value of the property so purchased.
15. The Apex Court in case of State of Rajasthan and others vs. Basant Nahata, reported in (2005) 12
SCC 77 has made it clear that the power of attorney holder C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED:
09/12/2022 acts in a fiduciary capacity and he cannot use the power for his own benefit.
15.1 The Apex Court has held and
observed thus:
"52.Execution of a power of attorney in terms of the provisions of the Contract Act as also the
Powers-of- Attorney Act is valid. A power of attorney, we have noticed hereinbefore, is executed by
the donor so as to enable the donee to act on his behalf. Except in cases where power of attorney is
coupled with interest, it is revocable. The donee in exercise of his power under such power of
attorney only acts in place of the donor subject of course to the powers granted to him by reason
thereof. He cannot use the power of attorney for his own benefit. He acts in a fiduciary capacity. Any
act of infidelity or breach of trust is a matter between the donor and the donee.
15.2 The Apex Court in case of Krishna Mohan Kul alias Nani Charan Kul and another vs. Pratima
Maity and other, reported in (2004) 9 SCC 468 also has held C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT
DATED: 09/12/2022 that when a person in a fiduciary relationship with another is in a position of
active confidence, it will be his onus to prove that there is a absence of fraud, misrepresentation and
undue influence and that the transaction was fair and real and genuine as well. The burden of
proving the good faith of the transaction is thrown upon the dominant party, the party who is in a
position of active confidence.
"12. As has been pointed out by the High Court, the first Appellate Court totally
ignored the relevant materials and recorded a completely erroneous finding that
there was no material regarding age of the executant when the document in question
itself indicated the age. The Court was dealing with a case where an old, ailing
illiterate person was stated to be the executant and no witness was examined to prove
the execution of the deed or putting of the thumb impression. It has been rightly
noticed by the High Court that the courts below have wrongly placed onus to prove
execution of the deed by Dasu Charan Kul on the plaintiffs.
C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 There was challenge by the plaintiffs to validity
of the deed. The onus to prove the validity of the deed of settlement was on defendant No. 1. When
fraud, mis-representation or undue influence is alleged by a party in a suit, normally, the burden is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43814866/ 14Prakash Babulal Sheth vs Shashikalal Mayur Sheth on 9 December, 2022
on him to prove such fraud, undue influence or misrepresentation. But, when a person is in a
fiduciary relationship with another and the latter is in a position of active confidence the burden of
proving the absence of fraud, misrepresentation or undue influence is upon the person in the
dominating position, he has to prove that there was fair play in the transaction and that the
apparent is the real, in other words, that the transaction is genuine and bona fide. In such a case the
burden of proving the good faith of the transaction is thrown upon the dominant party, that is to
say, the party who is in a position of active confidence. A person standing in a fiduciary relation to
another has a duty to protect the interest given to his care and the Court watches with zealously all
transactions between such persons so that the protector may not use his influence or the confidence
to his advantage. When the party complaining shows such relation, the law presumes everything
against the transaction and the onus is cast upon the person holding the position of confidence or
trust to show that the transaction is perfectly fair and reasonable, that no advantage has been taken
of his position. This principle has been engrained in Section 111 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (in
short the 'Evidence Act'). The rule C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 here laid
down is in accordance with a principle long acknowledged and administered in Courts of Equity in
England and America. This principle is that he who bargains in a matter of advantage with a person
who places a confidence in him is bound to show that a proper and reasonable use has been made of
that confidence. The transaction is not necessarily void ipso facto, nor is it necessary for those who
inpeach it to establish that there has been fraud or imposition, but the burden of establishing its
perfect fairness, adequacy and equity is cast upon the person in whom the confidence has been
reposed. The rule applies equally to all persons standing in confidential relations with each other.
Agents, trustees, executors, administrators, auctioneers, and others have been held to fall within the
rule. The Section requires that the party on whom the burden of proof is laid should have been in a
position of active confidence. Where fraud is alleged, the rule has been clearly established in
England that in the case of a stranger equity will not set aside a voluntary deed or donation,
however, improvident it may be, if it be free from the imputation of fraud, surprise, undue influence
and spontaneously executed or made by the donor with his eyes open. Where an active, confidential,
or fiduciary relation exists between the parties, there the burden of proof is on the donee or those
claiming through him. It has further been laid down that where a person gains a great advantage
over another by a voluntary instrument, the burden of proof C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED:
09/12/2022 is thrown upon the person receiving the benefit and he is under the necessity of
showing that the transaction is fair and honest."
15.3 In case of Sri U. Vijaya Kumar and another vs. Smt.Malini V.Rao, reported in ILR 2016 KAR
2670 a deed was executed by the attorney in favour of his own wife. The Court after examining the
provisions of Indian Contract Act particularly Section 215 of the Indian Contract Act has held that it
is clear that the sale deed was executed without the plaintiff's knowledge and consent and the same
is disadvantageous to the plaintiff. The defendants had concealed the same from her and hence, the
plaintiff has repudiated the transaction. The Court held that the agent is bound not only not to
injure the interest of his C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 principal, but also to
further it. He is not to place himself in a position where his interest might be adverse to that of the
principal.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43814866/ 15Prakash Babulal Sheth vs Shashikalal Mayur Sheth on 9 December, 2022
"29. In the instant case, there is no dispute that the plaintiff was the owner of 'A'
schedule property and the sale deeds stand in her name. The possession of the
property is with the 1st defendant; he is also the Power of Attorney Holder of the
plaintiff. The plaintiff is a resident of USA and the 1st defendant by virtue of the
Power of Attorney, is managing the schedule 'A' property. Now, under the same
Power of Attorney the 1st defendant has executed a sale deed in his wife's favour in
respect of the 'B' schedule property for a consideration of Rs.5,00,000/- without the
knowledge and consent of the plaintiff. The 1st defendant being the agent is now
claiming adverse interest of his own in the property. By such transaction, a cloud is
cast upon the title of the plaintiff over the 'B' schedule property.
30. From the evidence on record it is clear that the sale deed was executed without the plaintiff's
knowledge and consent and it is disadvantageous to her. The defendants concealed the same from
her and therefore the plaintiff has repudiated the transaction. The defendants are since
C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 asserting title over 'B' schedule property by
denying the plaintiff's title, it has become necessary for the plaintiff to seek a declaration that the
said sale deed is null and void and does not bind her. Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act confers on
the plaintiff a right to seek such declaration.
***
37. An agent is bound not only not to injure the interest of his principal, but also to further it. This
means that the agent should not place himself in a position where his interest might be adverse to
that of the principal. No agent will be permitted to put himself in a position where his interest
conflicts with his duty and therefore, he must not enter into any transaction which is likely to
produce such results. If an agent desires to do so, he must confide in the principal and must obtain
his prior consent. An agent cannot, without the knowledge or consent of his principal, be allowed to
make any profit out of the subject matter of his agency beyond the proper remuneration as an agent.
An agent therefore, may not use his position as an agent or his principal's property, or confidential
information arising from the agency for making a profit for himself.
38. Where an agent employed to sell, becomes the purchaser himself, then he must show beyond
reasonable doubt, that this was with the knowledge and consent of C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT
DATED: 09/12/2022 the Principal and that the price paid was the full value of the property so
purchased. Thus, in order to set-aside a transaction by an agent dealing on his own account, the
agent should have concealed material fact dishonestly or that the dealing should have been to the
disadvantage of the principal.
39. A principal who seeks to set-aside a transaction on the ground that the provisions of Section 215
of Indian Contract Act have been violated must take proceedings for that purpose within a
reasonable time after becoming aware of the circumstances relied on. The burden of proof lies on
the agent to prove full disclosure or that the transaction is not disadvantageous to the principal.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43814866/ 16Prakash Babulal Sheth vs Shashikalal Mayur Sheth on 9 December, 2022
40. What is disadvantageous to the principal and what is not depends upon the facts of each case.
Anyone standing in the position of an agent cannot be allowed to put his duty in conflict with the
principal's interest. If the principal proves that his consent had not been obtained for such an act
and that the agent had not acquainted him with all material circumstances, it is not further
necessary for him to establish any dishonest concealment by the agent or that the transaction was to
his disadvantage. Any transaction creating conflict between the agent's duty and the interest of the
principal, must be presumed to be disadvantageous to the principal who is not informed of the fact.
When there is no disclosure, the C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 fairness of the
transaction is immaterial and such transaction should be voidable at the principal's option.
41. In the instant case, admittedly the plaintiff who is the owner of 'A' schedule property executed a
General Power of Attorney in favour of her brother, the first defendant on 15.07.1995. The evidence
on record shows that a portion of the 'A' schedule property measuring about 12,070 square feet as
described in the 'B' schedule is sold by the first defendant in favour of his own wife, the second
defendant for a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- while the market price of the property as per Government
guidelines was Rs.96,56,000/-. This would demonstrate that the transaction between the
defendants is a nominal one and in fact, the 1st defendant has purchased the property for himself
and his wife is only a name lender.
42. The material on record discloses that Ex.P3, the MOU between the plaintiff and the 1st
defendant is silent about the plaintiff agreeing for such sale. In Ex.P18, e- mail dated 08.01.2009 the
1st defendant requests the plaintiff to sacrifice 30% of the sale value of 'A' schedule property to him
and his family and to decide the sale price. He has also advised the plaintiff not to go for distress sale
of the said property owing to bad condition of real estate market. He had even advised her to wait
for two years and to permit him to run the industry for two years. In this background if one were to
consider the C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 defense put forth by the 1st
defendant, it would be patently fallacious and unacceptable.
43. It is also seen from the evidence on record that an attempt was made by the defendants to
conceal the sale transaction in question, after depositing Rs.5,00,000/- into her account, by erasing
her name in the statement of accounts and inserting the 2nd defendant's name in that place. So that
she would not come to know about such deposit and take any action against the defendants
immediately. Not only this, the 1st defendant has sold a property worth Rs.96,00,000/- just for
Rs.5,00,000/- and this could by no stretch of imagination be said to be advantageous to the
plaintiff. The plaintiff thus has every right to repudiate the transaction and such a statutory right is
conferred upon the principal under Section 215 of the Indian Contract Act. The trial court, after
appreciating the legal evidence on record, has come to the right conclusion and we do not find any
reasons to interfere with the same."
15.4 In case of Mathra Das-Jagan Nath vs. Jiwan Mal-Gian Chand, reported in ILR 1927 Lahore 7
the Court was examining the power of attorney, his conduct of entering C/FA/1076/2019
JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 into the transaction where his personal interest conflicted his
duty towards the principal, to hold that except with the consent of the latter, he would not be
permitted to enter into any such transaction.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43814866/ 17Prakash Babulal Sheth vs Shashikalal Mayur Sheth on 9 December, 2022
15.5 The Court also referred to the decision of Lagunas Nitrate Coy. vs. Lagunas Syndicate where the
Court has held that it is an equitable rule, which has always been guarded and enforced with utmost
jealousy, that no fiduciary agent shall intentionally place himself in a position in which his interest
may conflict with his duty.
15.6 In case of Nabi Khan (since deceased) through Lrs and ors. vs. Roojdar C/FA/1076/2019
JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 and ors, reported in (2010) SCC OnLine Raj 604 the transaction
by a person in his own favour had been set aside by the Court.
"13. I have given my thoughtful consideration to the rival submissions and I have
perused the record. In the present case it is not in dispute that as per the plaintiff
Nabi Khan, an agreement for sale was entered into by Khurshid, the power of
attorney holder of the defendant Chand Mal for the sale of the land in dispute.
Khurshid is the son of the plaintiff and on the basis of the power of attorney executed
by the defendant Chand Mal in favour of Khurshid, the agreement to sell of the land
in dispute has been executed by the Khurshid on behalf of the defendant Chand Mal.
Even if the other evidence and the fact as to whether the deceased defendant Chand
Mal only executed the power of attorney for the purpose of effecting the partition of
the land in dispute and for representing the deceased defendant in various courts and
offices for the said purpose in favour of Khurshid as the deceased defendant Chand
Mal was residing in the State of Haryana at the relevant time is ignored for the time
being and only the validity of the agreement and whether specific performance of the
same can be asked for in the facts of the case read with Section 215 of the Contract
Act, 1872, I am inclined to agree with the submissions of the learned
C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 counsel for the
defendant-respondents that the provisions of Section 215 of the Indian Contract Act,
1872 are attracted in the present case. Section 215 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872
reads as follows:-
"215. Right of principal when agent deals, on his own account, in business of agency
without principal's consent. If an agent deals on his own account in the business of
the agency, without first obtaining the consent of his principal and acquainting him
with all material circumstances which have come to his own knowledge on the
subject, the principal may repudiate the transaction, if the case shows, either that any
material fact has been dishonestly concealed from him by the agent, or that the
dealings of the agent have been disadvantageous to him."
14. A look at the above provision together with the Illustration (a) below the Section
215 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 which his as follows:-
"(a) A directions B to sell A's estate. B buys the estate for himself in the name of C. A,
'on discovering that B has bought the estate for himself, may repudiate the sale, if he
can show that B has dishonestly concealed any material fact, or that the sale has been
disadvantageous to him."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43814866/ 18Prakash Babulal Sheth vs Shashikalal Mayur Sheth on 9 December, 2022
15. It is clear that the said provision is attracted to C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT
DATED: 09/12/2022 the facts of the present case.
16. It is not the case of the plaintiff nor so stated by the power of attorney PW-2
Khurshid that he had apprised Chand Mal about the transaction with Nabi, the
plaintiff, and obtained his consent because the power of attorney holder PW-2
Khurshid was none other than the son of the plaintiff Nabi Khan. In the transaction
the interest of Khurshid, the agent of the defendant, was inherent at the land was
agreed to be sold to his father.
17. Applying the facts of the present case, it is clear from the evidence of the plaintiff
himself that at the relevant time of the execution of the alleged agreement for sale on
17.02.1986 the price of land was much higher than Rs.6,000/- per bigha which was
agreed to by the power of attorney holder Khurshid, the son of the plaintiff while
entering into the agreement for sale with the plaintiff. Thus, the agreement having
been made at a price much below what was the price of land at the relevant time, as
admitted by the plaintiff of Rs.50,000/- in 1992 the price could safely have been
Rs.20,000/- as determined by the learned trial court in 1986. The said agreement
was definitely disadvantageous to the principal in the facts and circumstances of the
case. On account of the above, the principal (deceased defendant Chand Mal) was
entitled to repudiate the contract.
C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022
18. Looking at it from another angle, the son Khurshid, the power of attorney holder had entered
into an agreement with the plaintiff Nabi Khan who is none other than the father of the power of
attorney holder Khurshid it can safely be inferred that the agreement had been entered into by the
agent creating an interest in his own favour. There is no evidence in the present case to suggest that
Khurshid while doing so had taken the consent of the deceased defendant Chand Mal. Thus, both
the conditions which are there under Section 215 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 are attracted to
the facts and circumstances of the present case. In that view of the matter, the plaintiff is not
entitled to have the specific performance of the agreement (Exhibit-2)"
15.7 In case of Central Board of Secondary Education and another vs. Aditya Bandopadhyay and
others, reported in (2011) 8 SCC 497 the idea of fiduciary relationship has been explained in detailed
by the Apex Court.
"38.The term 'fiduciary' and 'fiduciary relationship' refer to different capacities and
relationship, involving a common duty or obligation.
C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 38.1 Black's Law Dictionary defines 'fiduciary
relationship' thus:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43814866/ 19Prakash Babulal Sheth vs Shashikalal Mayur Sheth on 9 December, 2022
"A relationship in which one person is under a duty to act for the benefit of the other
on matters within the scope of the relationship. Fiduciary relationships - such as
trustee-beneficiary, guardian-ward, agent- principal, and attorney-client - require the
highest duty of care. Fiduciary relationships usually arise in one of four situations :
(1) when one person places trust in the faithful integrity of another, who as a result
gains superiority or influence over the first, (2) when one person assumes control and
responsibility over another, (3) when one person has a duty to act for or give advice
to another on matters falling within the scope of the relationship, or (4) when there is
a specific relationship that has traditionally been recognized as involving fiduciary
duties, as with a lawyer and a client or a stockbroker and a customer."
38.2 American Restatements (Trusts and Agency) define 'fiduciary' as one whose intention is to act
for the benefit of another as to matters relevant to the relation between them. The Corpus Juris
Secundum attempts to define fiduciary thus :
"A general definition of the word which is C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022
sufficiently comprehensive to embrace all cases cannot well be given. The term is derived from the
civil, or Roman, law. It connotes the idea of trust or confidence, contemplates good faith, rather
than legal obligation, as the basis of the transaction, refers to the integrity, the fidelity, of the party
trusted, rather than his credit or ability, and has been held to apply to all persons who occupy a
position of peculiar confidence toward others, and to include those informal relations which exist
whenever one party trusts and relies on another, as well as technical fiduciary relations.
The word 'fiduciary,' as a noun, means one who holds a thing in trust for another, a trustee, a person
holding the character of a trustee, or a character analogous to that of a trustee, with respect to the
trust and confidence involved in it and the scrupulous good faith and candor which it requires; a
person having the duty, created by his undertaking, to act primarily for another's benefit in matters
connected with such undertaking. Also more specifically, in a statute, a guardian, trustee, executor,
administrator, receiver, conservator, or any person acting in any fiduciary capacity for any person,
trust, or estate. Some examples of what, in particular connections, the term has been held to include
and not to include are C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 set out in the note."
38.3 Words and Phrases, Permanent Edition defines 'fiducial relation' thus :
"There is a technical distinction between a 'fiducial relation' which is more correctly
applicable to legal relationships between parties, such as guardian and ward,
administrator and heirs, and other similar relationships, and 'confidential relation'
which includes the legal relationships, and also every other relationship wherein
confidence is rightly reposed and is exercised.
Generally, the term 'fiduciary' applies to any person who occupies a position of
peculiar confidence towards another. It refers to integrity and fidelity. It
contemplates fair dealing and good faith, rather than legal obligation, as the basis of
the transaction. The term includes those informal relations which exist whenever one
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43814866/ 20Prakash Babulal Sheth vs Shashikalal Mayur Sheth on 9 December, 2022
party trusts and relies upon another, as well as technical fiduciary relations."
38.4 In Bristol and West Building Society vs. Mothew the term fiduciary was defined thus :
"A fiduciary is someone who has undertaken to act for and on behalf of another in a
particular matter in circumstances which give rise to a relationship of
C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 trust and confidence. The
distinguishing obligation of a fiduciary is the obligation of loyalty..... A fiduciary must
act in good faith; he must not make a profit out of his trust; he must not place himself
in a position where his duty and his interest may conflict; he may not act for his own
benefit or the benefit of a third person without the informed consent of his principal."
38.5 In Wolf vs. Superior Court the California Court of Appeals defined fiduciary relationship as
under :
"any relationship existing between the parties to the transaction where one of the
parties is duty bound to act with utmost good faith for the benefit of the other party.
Such a relationship ordinarily arises where confidence is reposed by one person in
the integrity of another, and in such a relation the party in whom the confidence is
reposed, if he voluntarily accepts or assumes to accept the confidence, can take no
advantage from his acts relating to the interests of the other party without the latter's
knowledge and consent."
39. The term 'fiduciary' refers to a person having a duty to act for the benefit of another, showing
good faith and condour, where such other person reposes trust and special confidence in the person
owing or discharging the duty. The term 'fiduciary relationship' is used to describe a
C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 situation or transaction where one person
(beneficiary) places complete confidence in another person (fiduciary) in regard to his affairs,
business or transaction/s. The term also refers to a person who holds a thing in trust for another
(beneficiary). The fiduciary is expected to act in confidence and for the benefit and advantage of the
beneficiary, and use good faith and fairness in dealing with the beneficiary or the things belonging to
the beneficiary. If the beneficiary has entrusted anything to the fiduciary, to hold the thing in trust
or to execute certain acts in regard to or with reference to the entrusted thing, the fiduciary has to
act in confidence and expected not to disclose the thing or information to any third party." 15.8 The
Apex Court in case of Ashwinkumar K. Patel vs. Upendra J. Patel and others, reported in AIR (1999)
SC 1125 held thus:
"5. The High Court, while dealing with this appeal preferred by defendants 15 to 19,
observed that the trial Court had mainly relied upon a compromise decree dated
14.8.1992 between the owners(defendants 1 to 14) and defendants 20 to 25 in an
earlier suit, bearing Suit No.1384/88 filed by defendants 20 to 25 against the owners
on the basis of an agreement dated 14.10.1980, allegedly executed by the same
owners. According to the High Court, while it was true that the said defendants 20
C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 to 25 accepted the possession of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43814866/ 21Prakash Babulal Sheth vs Shashikalal Mayur Sheth on 9 December, 2022
the owners defendants 1 to 14, the said admission related to the date of compromise
dated 26.4.1990 and not to 14.8.1992 when the compromise was recorded and hence
the trial Court was wrong in thinking that the present defendants 15 to 19 could not
have come into possession on 16.7.1991 from the owners. According to the High
Court, the Trial Court was wrong in thinking that there was an admission by
defendants 20 to 25 of the possession of the owners, defendants 1 to 14 as on 14.8.92,
the date when the compromise was recorded and also in thinking that defendants 15
to 19 could not have come into possession on 16.7.1991. The admission, if any, related
to 26.4.90 the date of compromise and there was, according to the High Court, no
inconsistency with the case of defendants 15 to 19 of possession being given to them
under the agreement dated 16.7.1991. Further, the finding of the trial Court that the
property was new tenure was challenged even by the plaintiff by filing A.O. 476 of
1997. The High Court said that `this also makes the factual foundation of the trial
Court's order erroneous'. For the above reasons, the High Court set aside the order of
the trial Court and remitted the matter for fresh decision. It is against the above order
that the plaintiff has preferred this appeal.
6.The point for consideration is whether the order of the C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED:
09/12/2022 High Court in remitting the matter to the trial Court was necessary? Question also is
whether this court should remand the case to the High Court in the event of this Court holding that
the remand by the High Court was not called for? If not, whether the order of the trial Court is to be
sustained?
7. In our view, the High Court should not ordinarily remand a case under Order 41 Rule 23 CPC to
the lower Court merely because it considered that the reasoning of the lower Court in some respects
was wrong. Such remand orders lead to unnecessary delays and cause prejudice to the parties to the
case. When the material was available before the High Court, it should have itself decided the appeal
one way or other. It could have considered the various aspects of the case mentioned in the order of
the trial Court and considered whether the order of the trial Court ought to be confirmed or reversed
or modified. It could have easily considered the documents and affidavits and decided about the
prima-facie case on the material available. In matters involving agreements of 1980 (and 1996) on
the one hand and an agreement of 1991 on the other, as in this case, such remand orders would lead
to further delay and uncertainty. We are, therefore, of the view that the remand by the High Court
was not necessary."
C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 15.9 In case of Municipal Corporation,
Hyderabad vs. Sunder Singh, reported in (2008) 8 SCC 485 the Apex Court has held and observed
as follow:
"18.It is now well settled that before invoking the said provision, the conditions
precedent laid down therein must be satisfied. It is further well settled that the court
should loathe to exercise its power in terms of Order XLI Rule 23 of the Code of Civil
Procedure and an order of remand should not be passed routinely. It is not to be
exercised by the appellate court only because it finds it difficult to deal with the entire
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43814866/ 22Prakash Babulal Sheth vs Shashikalal Mayur Sheth on 9 December, 2022
matter. If it does not agree with the decision of the trial court, it has to come with a
proper finding of its own. The appellate court cannot shirk its duties.
***
33.Order XLI rule 23A of the Code of Civil Procedure is also not attracted. The High
Court had not arrived at a finding that a re-trial was necessary. The High Court again
has not arrived at a finding that the decree is liable to be reversed. No case has been
made out for invoking the jurisdiction of the Court under Order XLI Rule 23 of the
Code.
34. An order of remand cannot be passed on ipse C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED:
09/12/2022 dixit of the court. The provisions of Order II Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure as
also Section 11 thereof could be invoked, provided of course the conditions precedent therefor were
satisfied. We may not have to deal with the legal position obtaining in this behalf as the question has
recently been dealt with by this Court in Dadu Dayalu Mahasabha, Jaipur (Trust) v. Mahant Ram
Niwas & anr."
16.The defendants having failed to prove that the transactions was made in good faith, bona-fide for
fair consideration in the interest of the principal, and with the plaintiff's knowledge he being the
agent, this transaction of sale to his own wife and son surely can not be sustained to be a genuine
sale.
17. Reference would be apt at this stage to the application moved by the plaintiff vide Exhibit 132 for
issuing the witness summons to the Assistant General Manager, Andhra C/FA/1076/2019
JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 Bank, Parimal Society, C.G.Road, Ahmedabad. She had stated
that the certified copies of the statements of two of her accounts, NRO account No.1/1 and NRE
No.1/5 had been obtained. She would require the presence of Assistant General Manager, Andhra
Bank to produce the statement of the account of both NRO and NRE accounts by an authorized
representative as per the Banking Books of Evidence Act and to give deposition. The Court had
accordingly issued the summons.
18. Vide Exhibit 134, the plaintiff's witness Mr.Vadali Gangadhar Narayan Shashtri serving as a
Senior Manager of Andhra Bank had deposed that original Books of Accounts are in the custody of
the Bank, he verified the copy. All the three documents, the account of SBNRO 1/1, C/FA/1076/2019
JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 account No.NRE/1/5 and the ledger of NRE account No.1/5 have
been produced by him. He had verified them and these documents have been exhibited at Exhibit
136, 137 and
138. His attention was drawn to the document at Exhibit 137 which according to him is operated by
the power of attorney, it does not speak about the power of attorney and his attention was drawn to
the document at Exhibit 138 that also is the account operated by the power of attorney. In his cross
examination, this witness had agreed that in particular column 'self' is shown at Exhibit 137. In
ledger it is not clear that on 10.12.1996 whether it was a transfer or by self transaction. There could
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43814866/ 23Prakash Babulal Sheth vs Shashikalal Mayur Sheth on 9 December, 2022
be a possibility that it may be a transfer entry, the original ledger, C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT
DATED: 09/12/2022 according to him, is in the Branch. According to him, all the three documents
are the original true copies of the original account ledger.
19. Exhibit 136 when is seen, it is
reflecting the entry of Rs.20 Lakh on
10.12.1996, which had been withdrawn by
self. These are certified to be the true copies of the account/ledger/books maintained in ordinary
course of the business of the Bank. These are all accounts held by Mrs.Shashikala Mayur Sheth and
the General Power of Attorney Mr.Prakash B.Sheht defendant No.1. This, of course, is reflective of
the fact that the defendant No.1 Mr.Prakash Sheth is a General Power of Attorney and this
C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 withdrawal of the amount of Rs.20 Lakh is
through the self. This will assume importance in as much as the transfer has been effected on
09.12.1996 and the cancellation of the power of attorney was by a letter dated 08.12.1996. The stay
of the plaintiff and her husband in India because of her niece's wedding was from 02.12.1996 to
11.12.1996.
20. As mentioned above, it is not the case in the written statement also of the defendant No.1 that
the amount of consideration of Rs.20 Lakh had been withdrawn by the plaintiff, on the contrary,
heavy reliance is placed on the communication of defendant No.4 father of defendant No.1 and
father-in-law of the C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 plaintiff Shashikalaben,
who had insisted that the entire transaction of transfer of property had taken place pursuant to the
oral agreement and the family arrangement that had been made. In fact, from the beginning it is
emphasised that the family interest had resulted into transfer of the property.
21. It is necessary to make a mention of the cross examination of the defendant No.1, who had been
questioned seriously and vociferously that Laxmichand Godhardas Sheth had no HUF business at
any point of time. The business was started according to the defendant No.1, around 1945 and he
was not born also. The cotton-waste business of HUF had also resulted into its paying
C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 income tax which these persons did not have.
This business was closed 35 years back and he was 28 years of age. Defendant No.1 and the husband
of the plaintiff Mr.Mayurbhai Sheth both had gone to USA for their study and once again,
Mr.Mayurbhai went to USA in January 1972.
21.1 The defendant No.4 had two other brothers Mr.Jayantilal and Mr.Rameshbhai. On 26.06.1974,
Mr.Mayurbhai Sheth was given in adoption by defendant No.4 to his own brother Mr.Jayantibhai
and from 26.06.1974 Mr.Mayurbhai Sheth shifted to Mr.Jayantibhai's residence at 16, Subhasnagar,
Shahibaug area. He with his wife had continued to reside there till 1980 and the plaintiff gave birth
to two C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 children in the meantime. He was also
cross examined on the business of Security Equipment Private Limited and other businesses started
at GIDC, Plot NO.47/A. According to him, he had joined the business in the year 1971.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43814866/ 24Prakash Babulal Sheth vs Shashikalal Mayur Sheth on 9 December, 2022
21.2 There were other family members who were the share holders, which included his
grandmother, Mr.Mayurbhai Sheth and his wife defendant No.2. He had no written details or any
document to show that Mr.Mayurbhai was the share holder there. He agreed that Shri Jayantibhai
Laxmichand Sheth had cotton-waste business as a proprietor. The business of Security Equipment
Private Limited had run into rough weather because of the liver problems C/FA/1076/2019
JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 and was closed down in the year 1979. It was for the treatment of
the son of Mr.Mayurbhai who had meningitis that plaintiff and Mr.Mayurbhai, her husband had
shifted to America in February 1980 where the son was operated and Mr.Mayurbhai decided to
settle in USA only. According to the defendant No.1, he and Mr.Mayurbhai Sheth both were the
HUF member of Babulbhai Laxmichand HUF and till his brother was given into adoption, he
continued to be the member of HUF.
22. There appears to be an emotional appeal by defendant No.4-the father to his son Mr.Mayur
Sheth and to the plaintiff, who is respondent herein, where he speaks of the general and broad
understanding as C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 well of the family
arrangement. That according to him, which had resulted into the buying of the suit property as well
as the transfer of the same in the name of the defendant Nos.2 and 3. He also speaks of this
arrangement being the result of understanding of family that the defendant No.1 and his family
needed the place to reside and his having agreed to that. Again, over and above that, the amount of
Rs.50 Lakh he had agreed to contribute towards the need of the family.
23. However, the facts remains that this is all oral family arrangement which is being talked about,
there is nothing in the writing nor any valid document is put-forth to substantiate their version.
Even if, it is presumed that it was understood by C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED:
09/12/2022 everyone that the defendant No.1 as the brother and son of defendant No.4 would
continue to reside with his family members at the suit property and the power of attorney was given
to him for that purpose, there is bound to be cogent and acceptable evidence to that effect. It is not
unusual in a joint family in Indian society to continue to have internal arrangement along the things
however, till everything gets worked out smoothly, it is however, once there is a challenge before the
Court, it shall need to regard essentially the documentary as well as oral evidences on the basis of
the exhibited documents. Oral evidence which has come on the record and the chronology of events
which have taken place, if cumulatively, are examined, this C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED:
09/12/2022 appears unfailingly to be an action on the part of an agent in breach of the settled
principle of law where the agent is expected to act as per the expressed consent and nod of the
principal. He cannot in a fiduciary relationship divert the property for his own benefit. An attempt
was made on the part of the trial Court and this Court also to ensure that the parties amicably
resolve the disputes, considering closeness of relationship however, that has surely not happened
and therefore, the law shall need to take its own course.
23. The Trial Court has committed no error in setting aside the sale and directing the defendant to
handover the possession of the suit property in the stipulated time C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT
DATED: 09/12/2022 period. All the issues are answered correctly and in accordance with law.

24. We notice that this Court was requested by the appellant to direct maintenance of the status quo
in relation to the title, possession and the nature of the suit property at the time of admission. This
Court (Coram:Dr.Justice Vineet Kothari and Justice B.N.Karia) in its order dated 02.08.2021 with
certain directions for amicable settlement had granted the status quo order dated 15.07.2021 to be
confirmed till the disposal of the appeal.
25. We inquired from the learned counsels on both the sides to note that the disputes between the
family has not ended amicably as otherwise was proposed. Any of the parties, if has deposited any
sum pursuant to the C/FA/1076/2019 JUDGMENT DATED: 09/12/2022 direction of this Court, let
the amount be returned to the concerned party with accrued interest.
26. With the aforesaid discussion, Appeal fails and stands dismissed.
27. Civil Application is also stands disposed of in wake of disposal of the appeal.
(SONIA GOKANI, J) (HEMANT M. PRACHCHHAK,J) After the pronouncement of the judgment,
appellant has sought the time of eight (8) weeks to stay the judgment and order to enable the
appellant to challenge this appeal, which is not necessary.
