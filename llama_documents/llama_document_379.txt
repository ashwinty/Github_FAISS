Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124109/ 1Smt. G. Kusuma Devi vs Smt. Gowramma And Ors. on 1 August, 2006
It is the case of the plaintiffs that they executed an unregistered lease deed in favour
of defendant on 1-8-1986 leasing the suit property measuring 150' x 150' in Sy. Nos.
38/2 and 46/2 of Chikkabidarakallu Village of Dasanapura Hobli, Nelamangala
Taluk, Bangalore Rural District for a period of 30 years to enable the defendant to
put up a Petrol Bunk on a monthly rent of Rs. 1.750/- by taking security deposit of Rs.
25.000/- from the defendant; that in pursuance to said lease, the defendant was put
in possession of the suit schedule land who in turn put up a Petrol Bunk thereon and
is running the said petrol bunk and is paying the rents every month as on today; that
one of the condition of the said lease deed is that the lessee shall leave 20' width
space as passage for the usage of the plaintiffs on the eastern side to go to their land
which is situated behind the demised property; that since the defendant did not leave
any space as agreed on the eastern side, there is a violation of the terms and
condition of the lease; that the defendant has trespassed into the land of the plaintiff
to the extent of 6M> x 150 East-West and 7 1/2 x 150 foot towards North-South in B
Schedule land; that as the defendant has committed breach of terms of lease deed, a
statutory notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 was issued
by the plaintiffs to the defendant to quit the property and thereafter, the present suit
came to be filed for getting back the possession of the demised suit premises.
4. The defendant resisted the suit by contending that there is no breach of terms of lease and there is
no illegal construction or encroachment on Schedule 13' property as alleged by the plaintiffs; that
though there is an agreement between the parties to leave 20' width space on the eastern side so as
to enable the plaintiffs to approach their remaining land which is situated behind the suit schedule
property, the defendant has left about 20' width space on the western side in pursuance to the
subsequent oral request of the plaintiffs inasmuch as, leaving the said space on the western side
instead of eastern side would be convenient to them; that as there is no breach of any of the
conditions contained in the lease deed, there cannot be termination of the lease within the period of
thirty (30) years. Thus, the defendant prayed for dismissal of the suit.
5. In support of the case of the plaintiffs, one witness was examined and five documents were got
marked at Exs. P. 1 to P. 5. On behalf of defendant, one witness was examined and two documents
were got marked at Exs. D. 1 and D. 2. The Trial Court after appreciating the oral and documentary
evidence adduced by the parties, dismissed the suit by its judgment and decree dated 14-12-1994 in
O.S. No. 12 of 1992. However, on appeal by the plaintiffs, the judgment and decree of the Trial Court
was reversed by the First Appellate Court by its judgment dated 16-7-2001 and consequently, suit
came to be decreed. It is held by the First Appellate Court that the lease is a monthly lease and that
lease is validly terminated by issuing 15 days notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property
Act. It is also held that lease is to be treated as lease for a period less than one year and that the
condition in the lease deed that it is for thirty years will not be of any help to the defendant in view
of non-registration of lease deed. Hence, this second appeal by the defendant.
6. Before adverting to the merits of the appeal, it is relevant to note here itself that, on the earlier
occasion as against the judgment and decree of the First Appellate Court dated 6-12-1997, the
defendant-appellant herein preferred appeal in R.S.A. No. 343 of 1998 before this Court. As the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124109/ 2Smt. G. Kusuma Devi vs Smt. Gowramma And Ors. on 1 August, 2006
lease deed in question which is necessary and relevant to decide the question involved in the matter
was not produced and marked before the Trial Court, this Court remanded the matter back to the
First Appellate Court by the judgment dated 13-7-1999 with a specific direction to consider the
amendment application filed by the defendant to amend the written statement and to allow the
parties to adduce the additional evidence if any, on their behalf and thereafter decide about the
admissibility of the lease deed in question. But, the First Appellate Court, after remand, did not
allow the request of the defendant for production of xerox copy (photocopy) of the lease deed, since
the original was not produced. Thus, the said lease deed was not brought on record before the First
Appellate Court. However, the lower Appellate Court allowed the application for amendment of
written statement. On the basis of the material available on record, the First Appellate Court
decreed the suit by allowing the appeal filed by the plaintiffs.
7. In this second appeal, the defendant-appellant herein has filed an application praying for
permission to produce the xerox copy of the lease deed as additional evidence before this Court. The
said application is heard along with main appeal. During the course hearing, a memo is filed by the
plaintiffs which reads as under:
Memo filed by the respondents The respondents submit that the photocopy of the
unregistered lease deed dated 1-8-1987 may be marked as Exhibit D. 3 (subject to
objection regarding admissibility) in the above case.

Advocate for Respondents Respondent 2
Bangalore
Date: 4-7-2006
Thus, the plaintiffs-respondents herein submitted that they have no objection (but
subject to the question of admissibility) for marking the said lease deed as Ex. D. 3.
Both the learned Advocates submitted before this Court that by exhibiting the said
lease deed as Ex. D. 3, the matter may be heard on merits and that it is not necessary
to once again remit the matter to the lower Appellate Court for the purpose of
marking the document. Hence, this appeal is heard on merits by marking the said
lease deed as Ex. D. 3.
8. Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the defendant-appellant herein vehemently contended
that the First Appellate Court is not justified in decreeing the suit by holding that the lease
transaction between the parties is a monthly lease and that the term relating to the period of lease of
thirty (30) years cannot be looked into, in view of non-registration of the said lease deed. According
to the defendant-appellant, the lease deed Ex. D. 3 can be looked into for collateral purposes, which
means and includes the term relating to lease period of thirty years also; that when once the parties
have agreed that the lease period would be for thirty years, it is not open for the
plaintiffs-respondents herein to terminate the tenancy within the said period, particularly in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124109/ 3Smt. G. Kusuma Devi vs Smt. Gowramma And Ors. on 1 August, 2006
absence of any breach of terms of the lease; that though it is agreed between the parties that 20'
width space has to be left on the eastern side of the suit schedule property so as to enable the
plaintiffs to go their land, subsequently, the plaintiffs themselves have requested the defendant to
leave 20' width space on the western side instead of eastern side, inasmuch as, the same would be
convenient to the plaintiffs; thus, on the request made by the plaintiffs, the defendant has left 20'
width space on the western side of the suit schedule property. In view of the same, there is no breach
of any of the conditions as alleged by the plaintiffs.
It is further contended on behalf of the defendant-appellant that he is entitled to continue in
possession of the property for period of 30 years inasmuch as, he has got right to protect his
possession till then, in view of Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act. That the lease deed in
question may be treated as an agreement of lease and as the lessee has performed his part of the
contract viz., taking possession and paying rents, the possession of the lessee shall be protected in
pursuance of Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act.
9. Per contra, it is contended by the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the
plaintiffs-respondents that because of non-registration of the document, the lease cannot treated as
the lease exceeding one year and that the instrument became unless insofar as creation of lease for a
period of 30 years is concerned; that at the most, the lease can be treated as a monthly lease and
that therefore, termination of lease by issuing 15 days quit notice under Section 106 of the Transfer
of Property Act is just and proper. He further points out that there is a breach of a condition of the
lease by the defendant-appellant in not leaving the passage of 20' width on the eastern side of the
suit schedule land, as agreed in the lease deed and therefore, the defendant is liable to be evicted
from the suit schedule land because of the forfeiture of tenancy.
It is further contended by the learned Counsel for the plaintiffs-respondents that Section 53-A of the
Transfer of Property Act will not be of any help to the defendant, inasmuch as, the transaction in
question is a lease and not an agreement of lease; that it is not anybody's case that the transaction is
an incomplete transaction and that looking to the deed in question it is clear that it is a completed
transaction of lease; even otherwise, agreement of lease also shall have to be treated a lease deed in
view of provision of Section 2(7) of the Registration Act, 1908, for the purpose of Section 17(1)(d) of
the Registration Act; that even assuming that the defendant has got right to continue in the
property, he can do so till he is evicted from the suit schedule property in due process of law.
10. In view of the aforesaid contentions of the parties and the material on record, the following
substantial questions of law arise for consideration in this appeal:
(a) Whether the First Appellate Court is justified in construing the lease as a month
to month lease, in view of non-registration of lease deed?
(b) Whether the First Appellate Court is justified in holding that the lease in question
is for a period of less than one year, despite the condition in the lease deed that the
lease is for a period of thirty years? And whether the defendant shall be protected
from eviction for thirty years in view of Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act ?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124109/ 4Smt. G. Kusuma Devi vs Smt. Gowramma And Ors. on 1 August, 2006
As these questions are inter-linked, they are taken up together for consideration.
11. It is well-settled that unregistered lease deed can be looked into for collateral purposes, such as,
to know the nature and character of possession. In the instant case also, as the defendant has
entered into possession of the suit schedule property by virtue of unregistered lease deed, it can be
safely said that he is in possession of the property as a lessee. Thus, his possession will be lawful till
he is evicted in due process of law. Learned Counsel for appellant-lessee relies upon proviso to
Section 49 of the Registration Act, which permits admission of an unregistered document for the
purpose of Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act. The lessee is entitled to prove the document
as a contract for the purpose of Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act and take shelter to
protect his possession. In other words, Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act can be used by
the transferee as "shield" to defend his right and he can resist the attack made by the transferor. But
the mute question that still remains is as to whether lessee is entitled to continue for a period of 30
years, as agreed by the parties in unregistered lease deed, under the protected umbrella of Section
53-A of the Transfer of Property Act.
12. Sri M.P. Eshwarappa, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant argued that
the conditions of Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act are fully satisfied and therefore, the
plaintiff cannot eject the defendant for thirty years, i.e., the agreed period of lease, on the ground
that the lease deed is not registered. He relies upon the following judgments in support of his
contention:
(i) Maneklal Mansukhbhai v. Hormusji Jamshedji Ginwalla and Sons AIR 1950 SC :
1950 SCJ 317;
(ii) Lal Behari Sasmal v. Kanak Kanti Roy ;
(iii) Conceicao Antonio Fernandas v. Dr. Arfano De Lovola Patricia Furtado and Anr.
AIR 1975 Goa, Daman and Diu 27;
(iv) T.S. Karthikeya Mudaliar v. Singaram Pillai and Anr. AIR 1956 Mad. 693;
(v) Ramkrishna Singh v. Mahadei Haluai and Anr. ;
(vi) B.P. Sinha v. Soni Nath ;
(vii) Shrimant Shamrao Suryavanshi and Anr. v. Prahlad Bhairoba Suryavanshi
(dead) by L.Rs and Ors. .
By placing reliance on the above judgments, he contended that the lessee obtaining possession of
the property in part performance of the agreement of lease can defend his possession in a suit for
recovery of possession filed by the lessor, for thirty years in this case.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124109/ 5Smt. G. Kusuma Devi vs Smt. Gowramma And Ors. on 1 August, 2006
13. In the judgments of various High Courts cited in the cases of Conceicao Antonio Fernandes; T.S.
Karthikeya Mudaliar; Ramkrishna Singh and B.P. Sinha, the High Courts have laid down the
principle that proviso to Section 49 of the Registration Act specifically permits admission of an
unregistered document for the purpose of Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act. That the
lessee will not be able to claim any right under the terms of the lease but he will be entitled to prove
the document as a contract for the purpose of Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act and can
take shelter to protect his possession. There cannot be any dispute about the aforesaid proposition.
If the requirements as contemplated under Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act are fulfilled,
the transferee is entitled to get the benefit of protection from eviction under the said section. But in
the aforesaid judgments, the High Courts were not called upon to decide the question as to what
would be the effect of lease period exceeding one year, which is created under an unregistered lease
deed. In the aforesaid matters, the High Courts have merely held that the tenant has got the
protection from eviction though the lease is created under unregistered lease deed. Thus, the
question, as to whether the lease for the fixed period exceeding one year created under unregistered
lease deed can be acted upon to protect the possession for the said fixed period was not decided by
the High Courts in the aforesaid judgments.
14. The Apex Court in the case of Shirmant Shamrao Suryavanshi, held that person obtaining
possession of the property in part performance of an agreement of sale, can defend his possession in
a suit for recovery of possession filed by the transferor or by subsequent transferee of the property,
even if a suit for specific performance of the agreement of sale has become barred by limitation. It is
further held therein that if the conditions enumerated under Section 53-A of the Transfer of
Property Act are fulfilled, the provisions of said section can be invoked to defend or protect the
possession of the transferee and that the law of limitation does not apply to a plea taken in defence
of the defendant. In the said case, the question involved was as to whether the defendant-transferee
can defend on protect his possession over the suit property obtained in pursuance of a part
performance of an agreement to sell under Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act, even if a
suit for specific performance of agreement of sell is barred by limitation. There, the Apex Court has
dealt with the question relating to possession of the transferee under an agreement of sell. But in the
case on hand, the question involved is as to whether the lessee under an unregistered lease deed
creating lease for 30 years can protect his possession by taking shelter under Section 53-A of the
Transfer of Property Act, for thirty years.
15. The Apex Court in the case of Maneklal Mansukhbhai, has held that though the registered lease
deed was not executed by the Government in favour of the defendant, once the terms of the lease
had been reduced to writing, the said terms of the lease themselves should be treated as lease deed
and the benefit of proviso to Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act is extendable to the
defendant. The Apex Court observed that as the conditions of Section 53-A of the Transfer of
Property Act are fully satisfied, the plaintiff cannot eject the defendant on the ground that there is
no registered lease. Based on the said dictum laid down by the Apex Court, the Calcutta High Court
in the case of Lai Behari Sasmal has also held that though the lease deed was unregistered, the terms
of patta (lease deed) itself can be treated as lease inasmuch as, the terms necessary to constitute a
transfer can be ascertained with reasonable certainty and as the defendant has performed his part of
the contract, the plaintiff is debarred from enforcing against the defendant any right other than the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124109/ 6Smt. G. Kusuma Devi vs Smt. Gowramma And Ors. on 1 August, 2006
right expressly provided by the terms of the contract. Thus, the Calcutta High Court, in the said
judgment held that the defendant should remain in premises undisturbed till the expiry of 25 years
i.e., the term prescribed in the patta (lease deed).
16. It is no doubt true that the Apex Court in the case of Maneklal Mansukhbhai, as well as the
Calcutta High Court in the case of Lai Behari Sasmal have held that the transferee is entitled to
protect his possession for the lease period agreed upon by the parties, even under an unregistered
lease deed, in view of proviso to Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act. However, it is
necessary to note the subsequent enunciation of the law by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on the
subject, in order to come to just conclusion.
17. The Apex Court in the case of Burmah Shell Oil Distributing now known as Bharat Petroleum
Corporation Limited v. Khaja Midhat Noor and Ors. , has held as under:
In view of the paragraph 1 of Section 107 of the Act, since the lease was for a period
exceeding one year, it could only have been extended by a registered instrument
executed by both the lessor and the lessee. In the absence of registered instrument,
the lease shall be deemed to be "lease from month to month". It is clear from the very
language of Section 107 of the Act which postulates that a lease of immoveable
property from year to year, or for any term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly
rent, can be made only by a registered instrument. In the absence of registered
instrument, it must be a monthly lease. The lessee and the sub-lessee in the facts of
this case continued to remain in possession of the property on payment of rent as a
tenant from month to month. The High Court so found. We are of the opinion that
the High Court was right.
It is clear from the aforesaid dictum that in the absence of registered lease deed, the
lease shall be deemed to be lease from month to month, as contemplated under the
provision of Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act which reads thus:
107. Leases how made.A lease of immovable property from year to year, or for any
term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent, can be made only by a registered
instrument.
All other leases of immovable property may be made either by a registered instrument or by oral
agreement accompanied by delivery of possession.
Where a lease of immovable property if- made by a registered instrument, such instrument or,
whore there are more instruments than one, each such instrument shall be executed by both the
lessor and the lessee:
Provided that the State Government may, from time to time, by notification in the
Official Gazette, direct that leases of immovable property, other than leases from year
to year, or for any term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent, or any class of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124109/ 7Smt. G. Kusuma Devi vs Smt. Gowramma And Ors. on 1 August, 2006
such leases, may be made by unregistered instrument or by oral agreement without
delivery of possession.
18. It is clear from plain language of Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act that the lease of
immovable property for any term exceeding one year can be made only by registered instrument. In
the absence of registered instrument, the lease must be a monthly lease and not yearly lease or a
lease beyond one year. In this case also, as the lease is for a period beyond one year and as the same
is created by unregistered instrument, it shall have to be construed only as monthly lease and not
yearly lease or a lease beyond one year and therefore, the termination of lease would be only by
giving 15 days quit notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. It is not in dispute that
quit notice is issued under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act by the plaintiffs calling upon
the defendant-lessee to quit and vacate the premises, in this matter.
In the case of Satish Chand Makhan and Ors. v. Govardhan Das Byas and Ors. , it is held as under:
The unregistered draft lease agreement Ex. B. 2 was clearly inadmissible in evidence
under Section 49 of the Registration Act, except for the collateral purpose of proving
the nature and character of possession of the defendants. The document Ex. B. 2 was
admissible under the proviso to Section 49 only for a collateral purpose of showing
the nature and character of possession of the defendants. The proviso to Section 49
was however not applicable in the present case inasmuch as the terms of a lease are
not a "collateral purpose" within its meaning. It follows that the unregistered draft
lease agreement Ex. B. 2 was inadmissible in evidence to prove the transaction of
lease. It was also ineffectual to create a valid lease for a renewed term of nine years
for want of registration as required under Section 17(1)(d) of the Registration Act.
19. In the case of Mis. Bajaj Auto Limited v. Behari Lal Kohli , the Apex Court has observed thus:
The contention of the learned Counsel for the respondent that the aforesaid clause
cannot be looked into for want of registration of the lease deed appears to be correct.
Reliance has been placed on the observations of Fazal Ali, J. in Sachindra Mohan
Ghose v. Ramjash Agarwalla AIR 1932 Pat. 97, that if a decree purporting to create a
lease is inadmissible in evidence for want of registration, none of the terms of the
lease can be admitted in evidence and that to use a document for the purpose of
proving an important clause in the lease is not using it as collateral purpose.
The learned Counsel for the appellant attempted to meet the point by saying that so
far the consent of the landlord permitting sub-letting is concerned, it does not require
registration and clause, therefore, must be excepted from the requirement of
registration and consequent exclusion from evidence. We do not see any force in this
argument. The question whether a lessee is entitled to create a sub-lease or not is
undoubtedly a term of the transaction of lease, and if it is incorporated in the
document it cannot be disassociated from the lease and considered separately in
isolation. If a document is inadmissible for non-registration, all its terms are
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124109/ 8Smt. G. Kusuma Devi vs Smt. Gowramma And Ors. on 1 August, 2006
inadmissible including the one dealing with landlord's permission to his tenant to
sublet. It follows that the appellant cannot, in the present circumstances, be allowed
to rely upon the clause in his unregistered lease deed.
(emphasis supplied) Thus, it is clear from the aforesaid judgments of the Apex Court
that if the lease deed is unregistered, none of the terms of the lease can be admitted
in evidence and that therefore, the defendant cannot rely upon the said clause
relating to thirty years lease period by using the same under the garb of collateral
purpose. The term relating to period of lease is not a collateral purpose within the
meaning of proviso to Section 49 of the Registration Act. Collateral purpose is only to
see the nature and character of possession. As aforesaid, the unregistered lease deed
can be used by transferee only to show that he is in possession of the property as a
lessee. Thus, none of the terms of the lease including the clause relating to the period
of leasing the property for a period of thirty years can be admitted in evidence, for
want of registration of the document.
Again in the case of Rajendra Pratap Singh v. Rameshwar Prasad , the Apex Court
held as under:
Barring the proviso which enables the State Government to relax the conditions,
Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act consists of 3 paragraphs. The middle
paragraph contains an exception to the first paragraph. The wording of the first
paragraph shows that it is mandatory that if a lease is to be created for any term
exceeding one year, it can be made "only by a registered instrument". If the
instrument is not registered, the corollary is that no lease exceeding one year is
created at all. Such an instrument if not registered cannot be admitted as evidence in
view of Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908 either for proving the terms of the
lease or otherwise.
(emphasis supplied) Thus, it is clear that the Apex Court, subsequent to 1950 time
and again has reiterated the position of law that if the lease to be created for a term
exceeding one year, it can be done only by a registered instrument. If such an
instrument is not registered, it cannot be admitted in evidence for proving the terms
of the lease. Thus, in the instant case, any of the terms of the lease including the term
relating to period of lease for a period of thirty years cannot be said have been
proved.
20. In the case of Samir Mukherjee v. Davinder K. Bajaj and Ors. , the Apex Court has laid the
following dictum:
Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act lays down a rule of construction, which is
to apply when the parties have not specifically agreed upon as to whether the lease is
yearly or monthly. What this section does is to prescribe the duration of the period of
different kinds of leases by legal fiction leases for agricultural or manufacturing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124109/ 9Smt. G. Kusuma Devi vs Smt. Gowramma And Ors. on 1 August, 2006
purposes shall be deemed to be lease from year to year and all other leases shall be
deemed to be from month to month. Existence of a valid lease is prerequisite to
invoke the rule of construction embodied in Section 106.
Under Section 107 of the Act parties have an option to enter into a lease in respect of
an immovable property either for a term less than a year or from year to year, for any
term exceeding one year or reserving a yearly rent. If they decide upon having a lease
in respect of any immovable property from year to year or for any term exceeding one
year, or reserving yearly rent, such a lease has to be executed by a registered
instrument. In the absence of a registered instrument no valid lease from year to year
or for a term exceeding one year or reserving a yearly rent can be created. If the lease
is not a valid lease within the meaning of the opening words of Section 106 the rule of
construction embodied therein would not be attracted. This is the legal position on a
harmonious reading of both the sections.
In the present case, though the appellant has claimed that it was a lease for
manufacturing purpose, admittedly there was no registered written lease. Therefore,
the rule of construction as envisaged in Section 106 would not be applicable as the
statutory requirement of Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act has not been
satisfied. The plea of the appellant that 15 days' notice terminating the present
tenancy is bad in law would not be sustainable.
In the aforesaid judgment, though the lessee claimed that it was of lease for
manufacturing purpose (yearly lease), the Apex Court held that the same cannot be
treated as annual lease inasmuch as, the lease deed is not a registered one.
Consequently, the Apex Court held that 15 days notice issued by the lessor to the
lessee under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act for terminating the tenancy
is legal and justified.
Further, in the case of Anthony v. K.C. Ittoop and Sons and Ors. , the matter was
referred to Larger Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in view of conflicting
opinions rendered by the Benches consisting of two Judges. Ultimately, after
considering several of its earlier judgments on the subject, the Apex Court observed
thus:
The lease deed relied on by the plaintiff was intended to be operative for a period of
five years. It is an unregistered instrument. Hence, such an instrument cannot create
a lease on account of three pronged statutory inhibitions. The first interdict is
contained in the first paragraph of Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882
(for short, the TP Act'), which reads thus:
107. A lease of immovable property from year to year, or for any term exceeding one
year, or reserving an yearly rent, can be made only by a registered instrument.

The second inhibition can be discerned from Section 17(1) of the Registration Act, 1908 and it reads
thus (only the material portion):
17. Documents of which registration is compulsory.(1) The following documents shall
be registered, if the property to which they relate is situated in a district in which, and
if they have been executed on or after the date on which, Act No. XVI of 1864, or the
Indian Registration Act, 1866, or the Indian Registration Act, 1871 or the Indian
Registration Act, 1877, or this Act came or comes into force, namely.
(a) to (c) x x x x xxx
(d) leases of immoveable property from year to year, or for any term exceeding one
year, or reserving a yearly rent.
The third interdict is contained in Section 49 of the Registration Act which speaks about the fatal
consequence of non-compliance of Section 17 thereof, Section 49 reads thus:
49. Effect of non-registration of documents required to be registered.No document
required by Section 17 or by any provision of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 to be
registered shall.
(a) affect any immoveable property comprised therein; or
(b) confer any power to adopt; or
(c) be received as evidence of any transaction affecting such property or conferring
such power, unless it has been registered:
Provided that an unregistered document affecting the immovable property and
required by this Act or the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, to be registered may be
received as evidence of a contract in a suit for specific performance under Chapter II
of the Specific Relief Act, 1877, or as evidence of part performance of a contract for
the purposes of Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, or as evidence of
any collateral transaction not required to be effected by registered instrument.
No endeavour was made by the Counsel to obviate the said interdict with the help of
the exemptions contained in the proviso.
The resultant position is insurmountable that so far as the instrument of lease is
concerned there is no scope for holding that the appellant is a lessee by virtue of the
said instrument. The Court is disabled from using the instrument as evidence and
hence it goes out of consideration in this case, hook, line and sinker.

Taking a different view would be contrary to the reality when parties clearly intended
to create a lease though the document, which they executed had not gone into the
processes of registration. That lacuna had affected the validity of the document, but
what had happened between the parties in respect of the property became a reality.
Non-registration of the document had caused only two consequences. One is that no
lease exceeding one year was created. Second is that the instrument became useless
so far as creation of the lease is concerned. Nonetheless the presumption that a lease
not exceeding one year stood created by conduct of parties remains unrebutted.
(emphasis supplied)
21. Thus, it is clear from the aforesaid dictums laid down by the Apex Court that non-registration of
the lease deed cannot create lease for a period exceeding one year. Thus, in view of non-registration
of the document, no lease exceeding one year is said to have been created. However, the
presumption is that the lease not exceeding one year stood created by conduct of parties. In this
matter also, though the lease deed specifies the period of lease as thirty (30) years, in view of
non-registration of the lease deed (Ex. D. 3) no lease exceeding one year is said to have been created.
Thus, the tenancy in question would be only month to month tenancy and not the tenancy beyond
one year.
22. At this stage, it is relevant to note another judgment of the Apex Court (rendered by the three
Hon'ble Judges) in the case of Rana Vidyabhushan Singh and Anr. v. Rati Ram (1969) 1 SCWR 341,
which is directly on the point involved in this matter, wherein it is held thus:
The agreement was unregistered. It could not create in favour of the defendant the
right of a tenant for a period of fifteen years. The agreement was on that account
inadmissible in evidence to support that claim. But in support of the plea that his
possession was that of a tenant the defendant was entitled to rely upon the recitals
contained in that agreement of lease. Section 49 of the Indian Registration Act, 1908
insofar as it is relevant provides. A document required by law to be registered, if
unregistered, is inadmissible as evidence of a transaction affecting immovable
property, but it may be admitted as evidence of collateral facts, or for any collateral
purpose, that is for any purpose other than that of creating, declaring, assigning,
limiting or extinguishing a right to immovable property.
(emphasis supplied) This Court in the case of Abdul Razack Sab v. H.K. Gopal Shetty
1973(1) Mys. L.J. 541 : AIR 1974 Mys. 7, while dealing with the question relating to
Section 49 of the Registration Act and admissibility of the unregistered documents
for collateral purposes has observed thus:
4. In the instant case, the document relied on by the plaintiff purports to create a
lease for a period of 4 years. It is no doubt true that it cannot be relied upon by either
party to establish the lease for a period of 4 years. But as observed by the Supreme
Court in the above decision, it can be relied upon to prove that the respondent is a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124109/ 12Smt. G. Kusuma Devi vs Smt. Gowramma And Ors. on 1 August, 2006
tenant.
The dictum laid in the aforesaid two judgments by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and this Court make
it amply clear that the term relating to the period of lease created under an unregistered lease deed
cannot be relied upon to establish the fact that the lease is for a period of thirty years. However, said
lease deed however can be relied upon only to prove that the transferee is a tenant. If the said clause
relating to thirty years lease period cannot be relied on by the defendant-appellant herein, it is open
for the plaintiff to file suit for eviction by treating the lease as the lease within the period of one year
i.e., monthly lease. Consequently, the lease between the parties being only a monthly lease which
can be terminated by issuing 15 days notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. As
aforesaid, there is no dispute that 15 days quit notice as contemplated under Section 106 of the
Transfer of Property Act is issued by the lessor (plaintiffs) to the lessee (defendant), in this case for
terminating the lease.
It is also not disputed by the lessee that he has not left space of 20' width as passage on the eastern
side of the property so as to enable the plaintiffs-respondents to go to their land which is situated
behind the suit schedule property, as agreed between the parties in the lease deed. The contention of
the defendant that in pursuance to the subsequent oral request of the plaintiffs, he has left the 20'
width space on the western side instead of eastern side is not accepted by the Court below on
appreciation of facts. On reconsideration of the material, I agree with the said finding of fact.
Consequently, it is to be held that the defendant has failed to prove his contention. Thus, there is
breach of condition of lease deed as well.
23. Thus, in view of aforesaid discussion, it has been held that the terms of the lease deed in
question including the term of lease period of 30 years cannot be looked into because of
non-registration of the document (Ex. D. 3). It is also to be held that no lease exceeding one year is
created by virtue of unregistered lease deed. The lease between the parties is a monthly lease and the
term stipulated in the lease deed fixing the period of lease as thirty (30) years will not be of any help
to the defendant, as the same is inadmissible on account of non-registration of the lease deed. In
view of the above, the defendant cannot take advantage of the provisions of Section 53-A of the
Transfer of Property Act to protect his possession for 30 years.
Thus, the appeal filed by the defendant is devoid of merits and consequently, the same is liable to be
dismissed. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
However, having regard to the fact that the defendant-appellant herein is running a petrol bunk over
the suit schedule property, two years time is granted to him to quit, vacate and deliver the vacant
possession of the suit schedule property to the plaintiffs subject to condition of payment of rents
regularly. Under the facts and circumstances of the case, the parties are directed to bear their own
costs.
