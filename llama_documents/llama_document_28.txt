2. Para 16 of the plaint which deals with cause of action reads as under:-
“16. The cause of action for the suit arose on February 2015 when the Plaintiff came
across the defendants goods bearing the Trade Mark SPRINKLERS along with the
house name CATCH which is similar to the Plaintiff’s registered Trademark
SPRINKLE. The defendant is likely to increase its advertisements and expand its
business activities. Therefore the plaintiff is constrained to file this suit for
infringement of its Registered Trade Mark and passing off. This Hon’ble Court has
got the jurisdiction to entertain and try the suit under Section 134 of the Trademarks
Act, 1999 with respect to infringement of registered trademark since the plaintiff has
its office at Chennai within the jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court. The defendant’s
product SPRINKLERS are being marketed widely _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 within the
jurisdiction of this Hon’ble Court through stockists and distributors. A few sample
invoices are filed as proof of sale. Therefore the jurisdiction with respect to passing
off also arises within the territorial limits of this Hon’ble Court. The plaintiff is filing
an application for joinder of cause of action with respect to the relief of passing off
since the defendants are carrying on business outside the jurisdiction of this Hon’ble
Court.
3. O.A.Nos.942 and 943 of 2015 were filed in the present suit by the plaintiff for interim injunction
to restrain the defendants from using the trade marks SPRINKLERS/SPRINKLE towards the
manufacturing, selling, advertising of its goods and towards business marketing, selling advertising
in trade literature, invoices, websites, etc., respectively.
4. This Court vide its order dated April 21, 2016 was pleased to dismiss the said Applications filed by
the plaintiff holding that “this Court observing that the respondents are manufacturing and working
products like salt and spices by using their trade mark “CATCH” and the respondents pleaded and
proved that it was only to describe the nature of product inside, the word “SPRINKLERS” has been
used, and the words “SPRINKLERS” and “SPRINKLE” are commonly used words connected to
goods, which are by nature capable of sprinkling over a surface or _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 droplets over something. It is
therefore essential a generic word and there is no merit in the contention that the word
“SPRINKLERS” is a specific word and the applicant has a right to use that word to the exclusion of
all others and the applicant is therefore not entitled to an injunction to restrain the defendants from
using the word “SPRINKLERS”.”
5. Aggrieved by the above dismissal order, plaintiff filed an appeal bearing O.S.A.Nos.158 and 159 of
2016, before this Hon’ble Court. By judgement dated July 14, 2016, the Division Bench of this
Hon’ble Court disposed the said appeals of the plaintiff, holding that “… the conclusion in the
impugned order is liable to be sustained on account of the fact that the respondents are selling salt
and spices under their trade mark “CATCH” and the expression “SPRINKLERS” is used as an
adjective for the act of sprinkling”

6. Thus, no order of injunction was operating against the defendants in the suit. Both plaintiff and
defendants have been carrying on their _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 respective business during the last 7 years since the above suit was
instituted, without any prejudice to the rights of each other. After the pleading were completed, the
Court vide framed the following issues in the present suit vide order dated July 29, 2022:-
i. Whether the mark “sprinklers” is distinctive and entitled to protection under the
Trade Marks Act, 1999?
ii. Whether the plaintiff is the prior user of the trade mark “Sprinklers”?
iii. Whether the defendants is using the word “Sprinklers” as a mark in relation to its
goods? iv. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to relief in respect of alleged infringement?
v. Whether the defendants is passing off its goods as those of the plaintiff by selling
products by using the terms “Catch Sprinklers”? vi. Whether the defendants is
passing off its goods as those of the plaintiff by selling products by using the terms
“Catch Sprinklers”? vii.Whether the parties are entitled to any other reliefs?
7. After the above issues were framed on 29.07.2022, both the parties expressed their intention to
not to adduce any oral evidence as is recorded vide order dated 29.07.2021. Since the Application
No.4561 of 2021 was filed on 18.12.2021 and came to be allowed vide order dated 22.12.2021, the
case was thereafter posted before the Additional Master for marking of documents.

corresponding advertising expenses incurred by them from 2005-2006 to 2014-2016 in their
Written Statement.
34. As far as the complaint of the plaintiff that the use of the word “SPRINKLERS” either violating
or infringing the plaintiff Trademark “SPRINKLE”. It is submitted that the case of the defendants
that the word “SPRINKLERS” is a generic word used commonly in the salt trade.
35. It is submitted that the word “SPRINKLERS” is popularly and commonly used since ages to refer
to and describe a dispenser, small container or bottle or pack made of plastic or glass or stainless
steel with perforations or holes in the cap with a rotating lids to facilitate easy sprinkling i.e., free
flow of grains of salt or spices over food.
36. It is submitted that there are a number of salt manufacturers and _______________

countries who pack and sell their salt and spice products in such small containers/dispensers with
perforations on the cap and call them “SPRINKLERS”. A few examples cited are as follows:-

CHOICE g. MALDON
37. It is submitted that the word “SPRINKLER” is derived from the English word
“SPRINKLE” and commonly means a device perforated with small holes on the cap,
which is used to scatter water or particles over something. Various English
dictionaries of the word such as Collins, Merriam Webster, Random House,
Cambridge, Oxford, Macmillan, commonly define the words SPRINKLE and
SPRINKLER as follows:-
_______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 a. Collins
Sprinkle- to scatter (liquid, powder, etc. in tiny particles or droplets over something), to drizzle
lightly.
Sprinkler – a device perforated with small perforations that is attached to a garden hose…, a person
or thing that sprinkles.
b. Macmillian Sprinkle- to shake small amounts of a liquid or a substance such as sugar over the
surface of something.
Sprinkler – A piece of equipment used for automatically sprinkling water on plants or grass in a
garden.
c. Cambridge Sprinkle – to drop a few pieces or drops of something over a surface Sprinkler – a

of something over something.
38. It is further submitted that the word SPRINKLE is very closely _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 connected with the salt product
(and spices) since one of the ways to add salt or spices to the food is to sprinkle and it is can be
described as an act of sprinkling salt. It is reiterated that salt can only be sprinkled on the food as
the word “sprinkled” does not have any synonym, which can appropriately describe such an act.
While the words such as scatter, smatter or disperse may come close to mean such an act, it is the
word “sprinkle” which by custom and usage has come to be associated and is solely associated with
and used to describe the act of adding grains of salt to food.
39. It is further submitted that the word “SPRINKLERS” has a generic connotation, inter alia, in the
salt trade is lucidly illustrated by the fact that various online trade directories like Trade India,
Panjiva have a separate listing for manufacturers and suppliers of salt sprinklers.
40. It is further submitted that the word “SPRINKLER” is so closely connected and associated with
the salt product as explained above _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103368932/ 12M/S.Veppolodai Chemicals vs Ds Spiceco Private Limited on 21 April, 2016
C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 and therefore it would be unjust and unfair to allow a single trader
to monopolize the said word to the exclusion of others in respect of any salt related product. It
would be further unjust and unfair to allow a single trader to register and obtain exclusive rights in
the word SPRINKLE in respect of salt product so that he can prevent honest traders from using its
derivatives such as “SPRINKLERS” in respect of small bottles or containers with perforations on the
cap commonly and widely used to dispense and add salt to food.
41. It is further stated that the respondents/defendants are merely using generic word
“SPRINKLERS” to refer to a small dispenser/container of salt manufactured and marketed under its
well known and famous brand name and trademark CATCH. The said fact is apparent exclusive
rights in the word “SPRINKLE” in respect of salt product so that he can prevent honest traders from
using its derivatives such as “SPRINKLERS” in respect of small bottles or containers with
perforations on the cap commonly and widely used to dispense and add salt to food.
_______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015
42. It is further stated that the defendants are merely making generic use of the word
“SPRINKLERS” to refer to its small containers of salt manufactured and marketed under its well
known and famous brand name and Trademark CATCH. The said fact is apparent not only from the
use of the mark on its packaging but also from the references made to the word “SPRINKLERS” on
its website and promotional material. Sprinklers has been mentioned as a product category in its
spice range along with straight spices, blended spices, straight premium spices and Hin (asafoetida).
43. It is further stated that the plaintiff has been making generic use of the word “SPRINKLE” in
advertising its salt product. The advertisements filed as documents clearly show that the plaintiff is
promoting its salt product as “Iodised and prepared for sprinkling”. It also claims that its salt is
without any lumps and “For sprinkling easily”.
44. It is submitted that The said advertisement clearly shows the _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 plaintiff’s double standards that
while on the one hand it makes generic use of the word “SPRINKLE” in its advertisement and on the
other it has obtained registration of the said word and is preventing other traders from making the
legitimate use of the same or its derivatives such as “SPRINKLERS” as a descriptor or generic word
in the trade.
45. It is submitted that, in fact the plaintiff is estopped from exercising any monopoly rights, it may
have in view of the fact that it has itself used the word “SPRINKLE” in a generic sense in its
advertisements.
46. The plaintiff also filed its Reply Statement on 24.02.2016, when it was stated that some facts
stated in the defendants Written Statement had to be dealt by way of a Reply Statement but the
same was returned for certain compliance. Owing to the delay in representation of the Reply
Statement, an Application No.875 of 2021 in the subject suit was filed by the plaintiff on 15.11.2017
to condone the delay in representation of the Reply Statement.

47. The said application was allowed by an order dated 29.06.2021 in spite of objections raised by
the defendants through their counter affidavit dated 25.06.2021, thereby condoning the delay in
representing the Reply Statement.
48. The Plaintiff also filed an Application No.4561 of 2021 in the subject suit on 18.12.2021 to
receive additional documents; ‘Sample Sales Invoices (2009-2021)’ & ‘Sample Advertisement and
Advertising invoices (2002-2018)’. On being satisfied with the relevancy, proof and admissibility of
the above documents, this Court also allowed the said application in Application No.4561 of 2021,
vide order dated 22.12.2021, and as a result, these documents were marked as Exhibits P6 & P7,
respectively.
49. It is further stated that the defendants have failed to make out a case to dismiss the suit. The
plaintiff has filed necessary documents and established the contentions in the plaint and are seeking
a decree as prayed for.
_______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015

53. It is stated that the defendants are the proprietors of the country’s leading Food and Beverage
brand CATCH and manufacture and sell a whole variety of products under the Trademark CATCH
including salt, pepper, spices, seasonings, packaged natural spring water, soda, tonic, water, gold
and silver vark, etc. Salt and spices sold under the Trademark CATCH are known for their matchless
product quality, original aroma and wholesome flavor of authentic spices. The defendants’
_______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 CATCH
branded products are of the highest standards and are identified as such by the trade and public.
54. It is stated that a large variety of CATCH spices are sold in different packaging of small boxes,
sachets and sprinklers. The defendants use sprinkler packs primarily for Table salt, Chat masala,
Black pepper, Black salt, Dahi masala and Sendha namak, whereas kitchen range of blends, pure
spices and whole spices are sold in boxes and sachets.
55. The defendants submit that the word “SPRINKLERS” is not distinctive and the plaintiff is not
entitled to protection under the Trade Mark Act, 1999; and the defendants are not using the word
“SPRINKLERS” as a mark in relation to its goods.
56. On behalf of the defendants, at the outset, it is respectfully submitted that the plaintiff has filed
the present suit on baseless grounds which have no merit in law merely with an intent to cause
harassment to the defendants and secure a monopoly over generic and descriptive term in the trade
“SPRINKLER” and is presenting an inaccurate and distorted _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 picture regarding use of the
word “SPRINKLERS” by the defendants.
57. It is a settled position that descriptive and generic common words are not entitled to protection
under the Act. They are hit by Section 9(1) of the Act. In so far as the word
“SPRINKLE/SPRINKLER” is concerned, it is submitted that the same is both a generic and common
word as used in the trade of salt and spice manufacturing and marketing, it is also generally used to
refer to an describe a small container or bottle with perforations or holes in the cap to facilitate
sprinkling, i.e., the free flow of grains or salt or spices over food.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103368932/ 15M/S.Veppolodai Chemicals vs Ds Spiceco Private Limited on 21 April, 2016
58. It is stated that in the case of Standard Electricals Limited vs. Rocket Electricals and Ors.,(2004)
72 Del 794, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court has held that, “The word STANDARD is a common
English language word and is highly laudatory and is incapable of being appropriated by any single
person/company.”
59. It is submitted that in the case of Asian Paints Limited vs. Home Solutions Retail (India)
Limited, 2007 (35) PTC 697, the _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 Bombay High Court held that, “The expression “Home Solutions”
was inherently incapable of becoming distinctive of any single person with respect of any single
product or service. It is generic and publici juris. It describes the nature of services offered. Thus
understood, at this stage of the proceedings, it was held that it was not possible to accept the
plaintiff’s claim that it has unique enviable reputation and exclusive goodwill to the mark “HOME
SOLUTIONS”.”
60. Further, it was submitted by the Supreme Court, in the case of Skyline Education Institute
Private Limited vs. S.L.Vaswani and Others, (2010) 2 SCC 142, held that “the word ‘Skyline’ was a
generic word because the same is being used by thousands of persons and institutions as part of
their trading name or business activities”. It was therefore submitted that a generic descriptive word
was inherently incapable of gaining distinction in favour or any single person with respect to any
product and exclusionary rights cannot be afforded to the holder of such a generic/descriptive mark,
the plaintiff herein. _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.)
No.713 of 2015
61. Contrary to the plaintiff’s submissions in the Reply Statement, it is respectfully submitted that
the defendants are not attributing the meaning of SHAKER to SPRINKLERS. It is blatantly
incorrect to state that word SPRINKLER is ‘only’ attached to a garden hose and in relation to
liquids. It is submitted that the word SPRINKLER as an extension of SPRINKLE, is used specifically
in the salt trade and culinary field, to mean a device perforated with small holes on its cap, to
sprinkle salt, pepper, spices etc., on food or dishes.
62. It is stated that the defendants being in the food and spices industry and selling salt, chat masala
etc., description of their product would be SPRINKLER and not SHAKER. Thus, the appropriate
term as being used by the defendants and commonly used across the industry, would be
SPRINKLERS, which is derived from SPRINKLE, and a generic/descriptive word for the act of
SPRINKLING or to SPRINKLE salt, pepper, spices, on to food or dishes.
63. It is stated that the plaintiff in the plaint state that they filed a _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 number of suits to protect their
trade mark and have secured favorable orders before this Hon’ble Court. It is submitted that the
plaintiff have failed to file in the present suit, any of the orders and decrees as obtained in the said
suits to establish the protection of the mark “SPRINKLE” and the relevance to the instant case.
64. It is further stated that the plaintiff has themselves been making generic use of the word
“SPRINKLE” in its advertising documents marking as Exhibit P7, which clearly shows that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103368932/ 16M/S.Veppolodai Chemicals vs Ds Spiceco Private Limited on 21 April, 2016
plaintiff is promoting its salt product as “Iodized and prepared for sprinkling” and that it is without
any lumps and ‘For sprinkling easily’.
65. It is further stated that it is highly unfortunate that the plaintiff is blatantly using the word
SPRINKLE and its verb usage SPRINKLING in the generic/descriptive sense on one hand and
hypocritically on the other hand, seeking exclusive rights over the word to prevent other traders
from legitimate use of the same or its derivatives such as the alleged mark “SPRINKLERS” used as a
descriptor in the trade. _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.)
No.713 of 2015
66. It is further pertinent to note that presently the logo of the SPRINKLE brand as seen on the
plaintiff’s website www.sprinklesalt.com is indicative of the descriptive use of the term
SPRINKLE/SPRINKLER.
67. It is submitted that the letter “I” of “SPRINKLE” as seen above is being shown as a sprinkler.
Thus, the generic use of the word by the plaintiff itself ought to stop any rights as sought in this Suit
restraining the defendants and other traders from using the same generic word,
SPRINKLE/SPRINKLERS.
_______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015
68. It is further stated that this Hon’ble Court in the case of Nestle’s Products (India) Limited vs.
P.Thankaraja and another (AIR 1978 Mad 336) while discussing on the registration of the trade
mark “INSTEA” held that, “INSTEA” has the tendency to monopolise all manufactured tea which
goes by the generic description of ‘instant tea’ or ‘instantaneous tea’. To grant registration to this
word-mark, would therefore make Alvitone as its owner a monopolist of a part of the ordinary
vocabulary in which traders transact business with themselves and their customers.” Similarly, the
plaintiff herein, is attempting to act as a monopolist over the ordinary vocabulary term
“SPRINKLER” which is widely used in the transaction of business in the channels of packaging and
marketing, between the traders and their customers in the salt/spice industry.
69. It is also stated that the Bombay High Court in the case of Pidilite Industries Limited and Others
vs. Vilas Nemichand Jain and Others, 2015 (64) PTC 185 (Bom) has held that, “Therefore, mere
evidence of extent of use invoices, financial figures of sales and so on might perhaps show use or
even increased use. But something more is _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 necessary to show that the use is such that the mark has become
distinctive. As the commentary says, use itself does not equal distinctiveness”. In the context of a
descriptive mark even extensive use is insufficient and what is required, as is borne out by the
extract from the commentary in Narayanan on Trade Marks, is that the secondary meaning acquired
must be shown to have displaced entirely the primary descriptive meaning of the mark. To succeed
in such a action what a plaintiff must show is that the goods bearing the mark have come to be
identified with his goods exclusively and in the case of a descriptive mark, evidence is necessary of
members of the public as well, not just people who are specially placed to attest to its uniqueness.”
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103368932/ 17M/S.Veppolodai Chemicals vs Ds Spiceco Private Limited on 21 April, 2016
70. Accordingly, the mere invoices with specially placed persons (Vendors) as submitted by the
plaintiff and marked as Exhibits P6, would not be sufficient to achieve the requirement of ‘use’ and
‘distinctiveness’. Thus, the plaintiff is not entitled to any protection over the words
SPRINKLE/SPRINKLER.
_______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015
71. It is further stated that with respect to the mark being registered and the plaintiff in effect
seeking exclusive/monopoly over SPRINKLE/SPRINKLER, it is submitted that, Section 17(2) of the
Act makes clear that even in so far as registered marks are concerned, if the same contains any
matter which is common to the trade or is otherwise, of a non-distinctive character, the registration
thereof, shall not confer any exclusive right. Further, in a recent decision of this Hon’ble Court in
ITC Limited vs. Nestle India Limited, 2020 SCC Online Mad 1158, while discussing the terms ‘Magic
Masala’, this Hon’ble Court was pleased to hold that, “Both the words” “Magic” and its derivative
“Magical” are common to the trade.
72. Therefore, neither the plaintiff nor the defendant can claim any monopoly over the expression
“Magic” or “Masala” for they are common words in Indian Culinary and Indian food industry”. The
above order has also been affirmed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court. It is thus submitted that,
SPRINKLE/SPRINKLER being words of the trade in the specific food/salt and spice trade industry,
no single party shall be afforded any such monopoly/exclusionary rights over the same.
_______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015
73. It is further stated that the Delhi High Court in the case of Cadilla Healthcare Limited vs. Gujarat
Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Limited and Others, 2009 (41) PTC 336 (Del.) (DB) held
that, “… the use of the term “Sugar Free” by the respondent is not in the trademark sense but as a
common descriptive adjective.” Accordingly, it is humbly submitted the use of the term
“SPRINKLER” by the defendants is per se not as a mark in relation to its goods, but as a common
descriptive adjective.
74. In the light of Section 30(2)(a) and Section 35 of the Act, even a registered proprietor of a
Trademark cannot interfere with the use of the registered trade mark or any similar mark by any
member of trade, if the same is used to indicate character, quality or kind of the product.
75. Further, the above is consistent with the findings of this Hon’ble _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 Court in the applications and
appeals filed by the plaintiff in the O.A.Nos.942 and 943 of 2015 and O.S.A.Nos.158 and 159 of 2016
dated April 21, 2016 and July 14, 2016 respectively, wherein this Hon’ble Court has categorically
held that the word “SPRINKLERS” is a common and generic word and is used as an adjective for the
act of sprinkling.
76. It is thus respectfully submitted that the plaintiff’s mark “SPRINKLE” is not distinctive and
accordingly not entitled for protection under the Act. Further, the word “SPRINKLERS” is used by
the defendants’ as a purely generic and descriptive term to describe the nature of the pack/dispenser
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103368932/ 18M/S.Veppolodai Chemicals vs Ds Spiceco Private Limited on 21 April, 2016
in which its salt and spices are sold.
77. It is further submitted that the plaintiff is not the prior user of the Trademark “SPRINKLE”
78. It is submitted that the defendants use the word “SPRINKLERS” _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 on the packaging of its products.
As seen from the defendants’ Label marked as Exhibit P2, the brand name as intended for the
products to be marketed under is “CATCH” the registered trademark of the defendants.
“SPRINKLERS” is sandwiched between the brand name CATCH and the product name such as
TABLE SALT, and it merely serves the only purpose of being descriptive of the product and its
intended use and product category. Therefore, the use was purely generic and descriptive use of the
common word “SPRINKLERS” cannot be said to be a use of the word as a trade mark by the
defendants and therefore, constituting an infringement.
79. It is submitted that the usage of “SPRINKLERS” by the defendants, is purely an descriptive and
protected under Section 30(2)(a) of the Act which provides that “A registered trade mark is not
infringed where the use in relation to goods or services indicates the kind, quality, quantity,
intended purpose, value, geographical origin, the time of production of goods or of rendering of
services or other characteristics of goods or services”. Accordingly, it is submitted there is no such
infringement on the part of the defendants. _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015
80. Further, the Delhi High Court in the case of Peps Industries Private Limited vs. Kurlon Limited,
CS (Comm) 174/2019 has recently passed an order dated March 16, 2020 and held that, “As regards
the second issue i.e. whether the mark “No Turn” is used by the defendant as a trademark or as a
descriptive mark with the trademark to describe the quality of the mattresses, it may be noted that
the manner in which “No Turn” is used on the mattresses and from the brochure of the defendant it
is evident that the mark “No Turn” is not used as a trademark/brand but to describe the quality of
the mattress and thus the mattresses which do not require to be “turned around” are labeled “No
Turn”. Accordingly, it is submitted that the use of the mark “SPRINKLERS” is not used by the
defendants as a trade mark/brand, but only as a description of its products. Thus, the plaintiff’s
attempt to prevent such bona fide, fair use, which is simply descriptive of the container is illegal and
unjustified.
81. It is further submitted that the defendants has made a bona fide use of a generic word,
“SPRINKLERS”, which is also commonly used in _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 the salt trade to describe the
particular type of product packaging bearing perforations on the cap. Thus defendants’ use of a
generic word in the descriptive sense cannot make it liable for infringement or violation of a trade
mark.
82. It is further submitted that the defendants are not passing off their product as that of the
plaintiff while selling their products using the words “Catch Sprinklers”
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103368932/ 19M/S.Veppolodai Chemicals vs Ds Spiceco Private Limited on 21 April, 2016
83. It is submitted that the contention of the plaintiff that its goods with the mark “SPRINKLE” are
advertised extensively and sold all over India and anyone who sees the defendant’s product with the
Trademark “SPRINKLERS” will get the impression that the defendants are carrying on business
under the aegis of the plaintiff or are operating with the express or implied consent of the plaintiff
cannot be countenanced. It is submitted that the plaintiff have failed to produce any substantial
evidence in relation to substantiate the above assertion.
84. It is submitted that the container is a dispenser fitted with a _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 rotating lid which allows
sprinkling of content in it and with the help of the rotating plastic cap it can close the
perforations/holes/pores to keeps out dampness and thereby keeping the contents of spices such as
salt, chat masala and black pepper etc., fresh and dry and ensure free-flowing.
85. It is submitted that ever since its launch of CATCH table top rotator dispenser within the
sprinkler dispenser has made the defendants market leader in the said segment. It is submitted that
the Trademark “CATCH” is prominently displayed on all packaging in a unique script and form and
enjoys extensive goodwill and reputation and is exclusively associated with the defendants.
86. It is further submitted that Trademark ‘CATCH’ is a well- known trade mark on its own right
and the products sold with it enjoy a enviable market reputation and share. The phenomenal sales
figures of CATCH spices bear testimony to the goodwill and reputation that the said products enjoy
in the market. Defendants promote their CATCH branded products by way of consistent and
innovative advertising and promotional campaigns enlisting celebrities through every possible
media including _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713
of 2015 print, television, cinema halls/multiplexes, Live Media, hoardings at prominent locations,
Delhi Metro, etc. On account of such extensive advertising/publicity, along with widespread use of
trademark CATCH, defendants and their products have gained exceptional visibility and recognition
worldwide and in India.
87. Accordingly, on account of the aforesaid sales and promotional efforts made by the defendants
consistently over the years, trademark CATCH has gained the status of being a ‘Superbrand’. The
Superbrands organization which is an independent arbiter on branding and pays tribute to the
world’s leading brands which are chosen by experts and consumers declared CATCH as a
Superbrand in the year 2009-2010. In this connection Exhibit D9 shows that Superbrand had
declared CATCH of the defendants as a Superbrand in the year 2009-2010.
88. It is submitted as per the settled law with respect to passing off is the trinity test as laid down by
the House of Lords in Reckitt & Colman Limited vs. Borden Inc [1990] 1 ALL E.R. 873 and has been
applied by the Indian Courts consistently as reaffirmed by the Hon’ble _______________

Mohideen vs. P.Sulochana Bai, 2016 (66) PTC 1 (SC), wherein the three constituents as required to
be established are goodwill, misrepresentation and damage. In this regard, it is submitted that i. the
plaintiff has failed to prove its goodwill in the market and that the general consumers can identify
the product or service they provide. It is respectfully submitted, the brand CATCH of the defendants
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103368932/ 20M/S.Veppolodai Chemicals vs Ds Spiceco Private Limited on 21 April, 2016
has far higher sales and brand recognition in the country;
ii. there is no such misrepresentation to deceive the customers on the part of the defendants. The
brand/trademark/logo of the defendants is clear and unmissable as ‘CATCH’, and below it,
‘SPRINKLER’ is merely used as a descriptor. The same is also being done by several big
brands/companies in the trade/industry and no individual brand/company can claim exclusively
over the term SPRINKLER; and iii. the plaintiff has critically failed to establish the consequent loss
based on the alleged infringement/passing off.
89. It is therefore respectfully submitted that there is no merit in the _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 averments and allegations of
passing off made in the instant suit against the Defendants.
90. It is therefore submitted that the plaintiff is not entitled to the reliefs as prayed for in the above
said suit. In light of all the aforesaid submissions, it was submitted that the plaintiff has failed to
make out a case for grant of the permanent injunctions, costs of the suit and other reliefs as prayed
in the suit, as the defendants have not infringed or passed off the plaintiff’s registered mark, and
used the mark “SPRINKLERS” as a descriptive adjective and further, the very words
SPRINKLE/SPRINKLERS is a generic and descriptive word and widely used in the industry by
multiple brands, others in the industry such as Chefs etc., and therefore no monopoly rights can be
granted to the plaintiff concerning SPRINKLE/SPRINKLERS.
91. I have heard the learned counsel for the plaintiff and the learned _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 counsel for the defendants. I
have perused the Plaint, Written Statement, proof affidavits filed on behalf of the plaintiff and the
defendant and Exhibits marked on behalf of the plaintiff and the exhibits marked on behalf of the
defendants. I have also considered the case laws submitted on behalf of the plaintiff and the
defendants.
92. The present suit was instituted on 16.03.2015. The written statement was filed on 17.12.2015.
The plaint was later amended in the year 2022 pursuant to an order passed on 24.07.2022 in
A.NO.2341 of 2021. The defendant also filed a reply statement on 24.02.2016.
93. The registration of Trade Mark No. 592204 in Ex.P3 Legal Use Proceeding Certificate is for
goods in Class 30. It is for a Device Mark with the word “SPRINKLE” few other features. The Trade
Mark Application No. 592204 was filed as a device mark on 08.03.1993 by a partnership concern
M/s.Jothna Motha trading as M/s.Veppolodai Chemicals claiming user of the mark from 1986. The
aforesaid device mark of “SPRINKLE” was registered on 31.05.2005 vide Trade Mak No. 592204.
The registration of Trade Mak No. 592204 in Ex.P3 Legal Use _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 Proceeding Certificate is valid
and subsisting as on date.
94. Ex.D-11 print out of the various communication prior to registration ofdevice mark “SPRINKLE”
reveals that Trade Mark Application No.592204 for registration of the device mark “SPRINKLE”
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103368932/ 21M/S.Veppolodai Chemicals vs Ds Spiceco Private Limited on 21 April, 2016
was filed on March 8, 1993 in Class 30 for ‘Iodised Free Flow Salt’. The description claimed in Ex.
P3 Legal User Certificate for Trade Mark No.592204 also confirms the same.
95. Prior to registration of Ex.P3, The Registrar of Trade Marks vide Ex.P11 Examination Report had
raised objection to registrar of the device mark of ‘Sprinkle’ on the ground of distinctiveness under
Section 9 of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958. It was stated that “the word ‘Sprinkle’ was
descriptive of goods”.
96. Ex.D11 Examination Report of the Trade Mark Registry also _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 shows that there was a prior
pending application for registration of the word “SPRINKLES” as a Trade Mark vide Trade Mark
Application No.540647 in the name of Indus Diet Specialite Private Limited, Chandigarh.
97. The Trade Mark Registry had raised an objection that the word was not distinctive and had
raised an objection that the word was not distinctive. On the other hand, it was stated to be
descriptive vide in his examined report marked as Ex.P.11.
98. The application was ordered to be advertised in Trade Mark Journal. Since there was no
opposition to registration of the mark was filed, the learned Registrar of Trademarks directed the
registration of the trademark and had raised an objection that the word was not distinctive. On the
other hand, it was stated to be descriptive vide in his examined marked as Ex.P.11.
99. Thus, Trade Mark Application.No.540647 was cited during _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 examination. It indicates that
the plaintiff was not the first person to have adopted “SPRINKLES” as a Trademark and filed the
Trade Mark Application for registration as a device mark viz. “SPRINKLE” much later on
08.03.1983.
100. Prior to institution of the present suit on 16.03.2015, the plaintiff had also filed two other Trade
Mark Applications for registration of the word SPRINKLE as a trade mark vide Trade Mark
Application Nos.1398971 and 1398972 for registration of the word “SPRINKLE” on 14.11.2005.
These applications were registered on 14.03.2008 vide Certificate.Nos.694703 and 694955 as is
evident from Ex. P4 and Ex.P5 Legal Use Certificates filed by the plaintiff.
101. Trade Mark.No.1398971 in Class 30 has been registered “iodized salt and salt of all kinds” while
T.M.No.592204 in Class 30 filed on 08.03.1993 was confined to “iodised free flow salt”. Trade
Mark.No.1398972 in Class 30 is altogether for different description of the goods with which this case
is not concerned with. _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.)
No.713 of 2015
102. The word “SPRINKLE’’ is a verb. It describes an action. To “SPRINKLE’’ means to fling about a
small drop or particle over a surface. Anything that “sprinkles” is a sprinkler. Any device which
“sprinkles” is sprinkler. The word “SPRINKLER’’ is a common noun. The defendants have adopted
the word “SPRINKLERS’’ by adding a suffix “S” to the common noun “SPRINKLER’’ to describe
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103368932/ 22M/S.Veppolodai Chemicals vs Ds Spiceco Private Limited on 21 April, 2016
their attractive dispenser used for packaging “Iodized Salt, Chat Masala and Pepper Powder’’etc.
103. The word ‘’SPRINKLERS’’ used by the defendants in association with their Trade Mark Catch
was not intended to be used as a Trademark. It however forms part of “CATCH” Label used by the
defendants as a Trademark for marketing its “Iodized Salt, Chat Masala and Pepper Powder’’etc. in
the dispenser.
104. Although, the word ‘’SPRINKLERS’’ is used along with the their Trade mark “Catch” with a
stylized and colorful font and is intended _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 to describe the dispenser in which ‘’Iodized Salt, Chat Masala and
Pepper Powder’’ are sold with a rotating lid with pores by the defendants, the presence of the word
‘’SPRINKLERS’’ along with Catch in the Label renders it to form part of the trade mark adopted by
the defendant. It becomes a Trade mark within the meaning of Section 2(zb) of the Trade Marks Act,
1999.
105. The dispenser of the defendants is in cylindrical shape on which the above device mark has
been imprinted with the word “SPRINKLERS”. The dispenser has a circular lid with perforation
along with rotating lid to allow the spices, salt or chat masala, etc., contained therein to be sprinkled
on the food items. These are meant to be kept on the dining table for ready access to a person to
sprinkle salt on the food to enhance the taste. On the other hand, the packaged salt of the plaintiff
have to be stored in a container after the package is opened for salt absorbs water from atmosphere.
106. When the application was filed in TMA.No.592204 by the _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 plaintiff for registration of the
label/device of “SPRINKLE” as a Trade mark, it was “proposed to be used”. The plaintiff, therefore
is certainly not a prior adopter of the word “SPRNKLE”for iodized salt.
107. The plaintiff has also not disputed that the defendants commenced business in 1987. The
plaintiff has failed to establish that the plaintiff was the first one to adopt or is the prior user of the
mark SPRINKLE in respect of the salt products.
108. Both the words SPRINKLE/SPRINKLERS are both descriptive and common words and
incapable of being monopolized registered of a trademark, let alone entitled to protection under the
Act in their favor although the word SPRINKLE has been registered. _______________

109. In Abercrombie & Fitch Company vs. Hunting World Incorporated, 537 F.2d 4 (2d Cir. 1976)
(Abercrombie), the Court held as under:-
“The cases, and in some instances the Lanham Act, identify your different categories
of terms with respect to trademark protection. Arrayed in an ascending order which
roughly reflects their eligibility to trademark status and the degree of protection
accorded, these classes are (1) generic, (2) descriptive, (3) suggestive, (4) arbitrary or
fanciful. The lines of demarcation, however, are not always bright…”

110. In the case of Free Elective Network Private Limited vs. Matrimony.Com
Limited, C.S.No.122 of 2021, the Court observed as under:-
“17. Since a generic term describes either the product/service category or the
product/service, no person is permitted to monopolize or appropriate such term and
claim exclusive use thereof. For example, trademark protection and exclusivity
cannot be claimed over the term “car” when used for a motor car or “radio” or
“television” when used in relation to the said products. In contrast to generic or
common descriptive terms, a descriptive term describes a characteristic or ingredient
or quality or intended purpose of a product or service. Such terms may be entitled to
p r o t e c t i o n p r o v i d e d t h e y a c q u i r e _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 distinctiveness
and secondary meaning. In Zatarains, Inc. v. Oak Grove Smokehouse, 698 F.2d 786
(Zatarains), the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit formulated four tests to
discern if a mark is descriptive: whether the mark has a dictionary meaning; whether
imagination is required to connect the product or service to the mark and, if so, how
much; whether competitors are likely to need the terms used in the mark to describe
their product or service; and the extent of use of the term by others to market a
similar product or service. If the above tests were to be applied to the sub-element
“Jodi” in its application to a website or app that facilitates subscribers to find a
long-term partner or spouse, the sub-element “Jodi” in the mark is a dictionary word
in the Tamil and Hindi languages meaning a pair or couple. The term directly refers
to the intended purpose of the service and it is not necessary to exercise one's
imagination to make the connection.
While the use of the term as a trademark by other providers of similar services is not
necessary, the term may be required to be used at least descriptively by other service
providers in the same field. Finally, the evidence on record discloses that a number of
other service providers use the element “Jodi” as part of their website or app. It
should also be noticed that “Jodi” is clearly indicative of the intended purpose of the
service, but it does not describe the service. Because it clearly refers to and does not
merely suggest the intended purpose, it falls within the descriptive and not the
suggestive category. As a descriptive mark, it certainly does not have inherent
distinctiveness. This leads to the question whether the mark has acquired
distinctiveness.”
111. In ITC Limited vs. Nestle India Limited, C.S.No.231 of 2013, the Court observed
as follows:-
_______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 “137. The
purpose of a trademark/service mark is to establish a trade connection between the goods or the
service offered by the proprietor of such a trademark/service mark. An average consumer decides to
pay for such goods or service by referring to the mark associated with them.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103368932/ 24M/S.Veppolodai Chemicals vs Ds Spiceco Private Limited on 21 April, 2016
149. A mark, which conveys character or quality of the goods, is a descriptive mark. It is an
inherently weak mark and is almost incapable of being protected and/or registered unless it has
acquired distinctiveness due to its long and continuous use over a period of time to the exclusion of
others.
150. Proprietor who chooses words or artistic work which are not distinctive and are inherently
weak or is incapable of protection, run the risk of such mark trampled or used by others. Law will
cannot come to their rescue and they are often left without any remedy. Descriptive marks may
attain distinctiveness on account of its long use and if nobody else had used it prior in time. If the
marks are invented or coined as a new word, it affords a higher decree of protection under law.
151. Therefore, before conceiving a mark to establish a trade connection, proprietors are expected to
choose marks wisely which are either arbitrary, fanciful and/or at best suggestive of their
product/goods/services to market.
152. If the mark is suggestive, it would require to pass the test of imagination for being protected.
The more imagination is required on the customer’s part to get the direct description of the product
from the _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015
term, the more likely the term is suggestive and not descriptive.
153. In Stix Products Inc. Vs. United Merchants &Mfrs Inc., 295 F.Supp 479,160 USPQ7777
(SCNY1968), Judge Weinfeld’s formulation of the imagination test is often quoted in applied:- “A
term is suggestive if it requires imagination, thought and perception to reach a conclusion as to the
nature of the goods. The term is descriptive if it walked with conveys an immediate idea of the
ingredients, qualifies or characteristics of the goods”.
154. For instance, Rexona, Vivel, Liril, Margo, etc. for soap, Bata, Reebok for footwear, etc. prima
facie appear to be invented or coined words. They may command a higher decree of protection if
there is a contest. Similarly, Apple for apple computers, Ipad, Iphone or Maggi for various food
products manufactured and marketed by the defendant or Sunfeast Yipee! by the plaintiff,
Hushpuppies, Pavers, Nike, Puma etc. for foot wear appear to be fanci & arbitrary words and
therefore command a higher decree of protection.
155. Composite label used by both the plaintiff and the defendant in Exhibits P19 and 21 qualify as
trademarks. However, same cannot be said about the expression “Magic Masala” or “Magical
Masala” used in the respective labels.
156. Under the Trade Marks Act, 1999, proprietors are entitled to apply for registration. If the mark
is registered, such proprietor can take proceedings for _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 infringement of their mark.
However, if the mark is not registered, common law protection of passing-off is available to such
proprietors.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103368932/ 25M/S.Veppolodai Chemicals vs Ds Spiceco Private Limited on 21 April, 2016
157. In Godfrey Philips India Ltd. Vs.Girnar Food & Beverages (P) Ltd., (2004) 5 SCC 257, the
Division Bench of the High Court had held that phrase “SUPER CUP” which was used as a
trademark was descriptive and laudatory of the goods of the appellant and, therefore, the appellant
was not entitled to any order of injunction.
158. The Hon’ble Supreme Court however while remanding the case to the Division Bench of the
High Court held that, “A descriptive trade mark may be entitled to protection, if it has assumed a
secondary meaning which identifies it with a particular product or as being from a particular
source”.
159. Thus, a “descriptive term” which directly and clearly conveys information about the ingredients,
qualities and characteristics of the product or services is not protectable at the first instance but may
qualify for protection if it has assumed a secondary meaning and identifies a particular product or as
being from a particular source.
160. On the other hand, a “suggestive term” used as a mark which indirectly suggest the qualities
and characteristics of the product may be registrable and protected.
161. Before an expression attains a secondary meaning in the eyes of the consumers, it has to go
through a long and an arduous uninterrupted use. _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 Such use are at the risk of being
run-over or trampled and used by others. Before such words or expression achieve a secondary
meaning, they are at the risk of being used by others in which case they loose their claim for
protection under law.
162. If such a proprietor initiates an action for an injunction to exclude a subsequent user in their
journey to distinguish such words as their marks, the Courts rarely rescue such proprietors. Such
proprietors promote such words or expression as their marks at their peril.
163. Thus, the thumb rule under the law is that words or the expression which and are not
distinctive are inherently weak and are therefore incapable of being registered or protected.
164. However, such words may become distinctive on account of their long and uninterrupted use
over a period time as a result of which they may get a secondary meaning and the consumer may
begin to associate them with the goods of such proprietor.”
112. During the pendency of the present suit the defendants have also filed application for
registration of the device “Catch Sprinklers” in TM.No.2535739 on 22.05.2013 in Class 30. The
registration was also granted to the defendants by the Trademark Registry vide

C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015
113. Similarly, the defendants had also filed another application for registration of the device mark
in TM.No.2535740 in Class 30 on 22.05.2013. The said device mark has been registered by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103368932/ 26M/S.Veppolodai Chemicals vs Ds Spiceco Private Limited on 21 April, 2016

which have been registered in favour of the defendants are as under:-

on the _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015
container for selling table salt, chat masala and pepper.
115. On the other hand, the three registered Trademarks in Class 30 which have been referred to
supra of the plaintiff are the salt package of the wrapper. Though the applications for registration of
the device of “Catch Sprinklers” were filed by the defendants on 22.03.2013, the registrations have
been secured during the pendency of the Suit on 22.05.2017 vide Certificate Nos.1556942 and
1557658, were not marked.
116. There are no records to show that these registration was opposed by the plaintiff or any steps
were taken to rectify the registration secured by the plaintiff.
117. The defendants ought to have taken steps for marking these certificates as Exhibits before this
Court. The Written Statement filed by the defendants is also silent regarding the applications filed
for registration of the Device Marks vide TM.Nos.2535739 and 2535750 on 22.05.2013. However,
the fact remains that these marks have been now registered. The copies of which were produced

favour of the defendants vide above two TM.Nos.2535739 and 2535750. The plaintiff has also not
filed any application to oppose the registration.

123. These information are readily available to public with the click of the button by accessing the
portal maintained by the Office of the Controller General of Patents, Designs & Trade Marks,
Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion, Ministry of Commerce & Industry.
124. The defendants have also furnished copies of the Trademark Certificates vide above two
TM.Nos.2535739 and 2535750 which are available in the due course of hearing.
125. Under Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 the Court can take judicial notice of certain
facts. Under Section 57(6) of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 the Court can take cognizance of all seals
which any person is authorized to use by the Constitution or an Act of the Parliament.
126. Thus, Court can take judicial notice of these facts although the _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 defendants have been negligent
in not bringing it on record by properly marketing them as the document, even though the Court
had permitted the respective parties to hand the documents before the learned Master by an order
dated 29.07.2022.
127. Further as per Section 74 (i) and (ii) of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 the certificate issued by
the Trade Mark Registry is to be construed as public document viz., official bodies and tribunals.
The Tribunal has been defined in Trademarks Act, 1999 in Section 2 (ze) as follows:-
“2(ze) ‘tribunal’ means the Registrar or, as the case may be, the Appellate Board,
before which the proceeding concerned is pending”
128. However, there is a lacuna on the part of the defendants in as much as the
defendants have not produced certified copy as is required under Section 77 of the
Indian Evidence Act,1872. However, considering the fact that the information is

has been reproduced in this Judgement. Therefore, these documents are to be considered as
necessary for a fair disposal of the case.
130. In the light of the above, the issue therefore to be considered is whether the plaintiff is entitled
to succeed, even though the defendants have failed to mark these documents as exhibits.
131. In this connection Section 28 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 is relevant. Section 28 of the Trade
Marks Act, 1999, confers right on a registered proprietor of the Trademark to obtain relief in respect
of infringement of a Trademark in the manner provided in the Act. Section 28 of the Trademarks

2. The exclusive right to the use of a trade mark given under sub-section (1) shall be subject to any
conditions and limitations to which the registration is subject.
3. Where two or more persons are registered proprietors of trade marks, which are identical with or
nearly resemble each other, the exclusive right to the use of any of those trade marks shall not
(except so far as their respective rights are subject to any conditions or limitations entered on the
register) be deemed to have been acquired by any one of those persons as against any other of those
persons merely by registration of the trade marks but each of those persons has otherwise the same
rights as against other persons (not being registered users using by way of permitted use) as he
would have if he were the sole registered proprietor.”
132. Sub-section 3 to Section 28 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 has an exception. It deals with the
situation where two or more persons are registered proprietors of Trademarks, which are identical
with or nearly _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of
2015 resemble each other, the exclusive right to the use of the trademark will not give a right of
action against them merely on account of registration of the Trademark. However, such right can be
enforced against any other persons not being the registered proprietor and/or registered users other
than by way of permitted use. The registration of the marks vide T.M.No.2535739 and
T.M.No.2535740 in Class 30 date back to the date of the application on 22.05.2013, i.e, two years
prior to institution of the present suit on 16.03.2015.
133. As on date there are no rival proceedings to registrations of T.M.No.2535739 and
T.M.No.2535740 in Class 30. In the light of the above it has to be construed that there is no
infringement of the registered Trademark of the plaintiff by the defendants. Infringement can arise
only if a mark is used by a person not being the registered proprietor of the Trademark. Therefore,
there is no case made out for infringement of the Trademark.
134. In ITC Limited vs. Nestle India Limited, C.S.No.231 of 2013, the Court has discussed the scope
of “passing-off” as follows:- _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm.
Div.) No.713 of 2015
169. The expression “passing-off” means and suggest to pass-off one’s goods as that of another
person whose product has a reputation in the market and to dilute such person’s goodwill. It is to
trade on the good-will of another person and thereby not only to deceive the buyers (consumers) but
also is intended to cause injury to the proprietor of the trademark. This is the essence of passing off.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103368932/ 30M/S.Veppolodai Chemicals vs Ds Spiceco Private Limited on 21 April, 2016
170. Passing- off action is a common law remedy recognised under the above Act. An action for
passing-off is a broader remedy than an action for infringement of a trademark under Section 134
the said Act. It is to restrain or stop by an order of a Court an unfair trade practice by a competitor
who misleads the consumer by making them believe that they are indeed purchasing the goods of
his competitor.
171. An action for passing-off is not merely confined to protect an unregistered trademark of a
proprietor. It is also intended to protect overall colour scheme, get-up, layout and trade dress etc.
adopted by a proprietor which his competitor unfairly copies and causes deception on the consumer
and thereby inflicts a loss on the proprietor.
172. Loss to the consumer is the actual loss for the consumer is cheated by the competitor. Though a
consumer suffers, rarely a consumer take action against the perpetrator unless the consumer
approaches the Consumer Forum.
_______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015
173. Loss to the proprietor in the case of passing-off is a direct reduction in sale, growth, dilution of
the intrinsic value of the mark and risk of being exposed to unnecessary civil action and the
expenses incurred in connection of burden of vigilient.
174. The purpose of passing-off action is not only to protect commercial goodwill but is also to
ensure that the purchasers are not exploited and dishonesty intrading is prevented. For that the
plaintiff must establish that his business or goods have acquired reputation. [Sir Shadi Lal
Enterprise Ltd.Vs. Kesar Enterprise Ltd., 1998 PTC(18)].
175. On passing-off, eminent jurist Salmond in Law of Torts, 17 th Edn. p. 401 has stated as follows:
- "The gist of the conception of passing-off is that the goods are in effect telling a falsehood about
themselves, are saying something about themselves, which is calculated to mislead. The law on this
matter is designed to protect traders against that form of unfair competition which consists in
acquiring for oneself, by means of false or misleading devices the benefit of the reputation already
achieved by rival traders."
176. In an action for passing-off, the plaintiff is required to show colourable imitation so calculated
to cause deception that the goods traded by him are to be taken to by the ordinary purchaser as that
of the plaintiff.
177. While testing whether there is actual confusion or not by such copying, the court adopts the test
of an _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015
ordinary person with an average intelligence and imperfect recollection. [See Corn Products
Refining Co. Vs. Skangrila Food Products Ltd., (1960) (1) SCR 968 and Amritdhara Pharmacy Vs.
Satya Deo Gupta, (1963) 2 SCR 484: AIR 1963 SC 449]. In Amritdhara Pharmacy Vs. Satya Deo
Gupta, (1963) 2 SCR 484 : AIR 1963 SC 449, on facts it was held that “To such a man the overall
structural and phonetic similarity-of the two names “Amritdhara” and “Lakshmandhara” is, in our
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103368932/ 31M/S.Veppolodai Chemicals vs Ds Spiceco Private Limited on 21 April, 2016
opinion, likely to deceive or cause confusion”.
178. In Cadila Health Care Ltd. Vs. Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd., (2001) 5 SCC 73, the Hon’ble
Supreme Court observed as under:
Broadly stated, in an action for passing-off on the basis of unregistered trade mark generally for
deciding the question of deceptive similarity the following factors are to be considered:
(a) The nature of the marks i.e. whether the marks are word marks or label marks or composite
marks i.e. both words and label works.
(b) The degree of resembleness between the marks, phonetically similar and hence similar in idea.
(c) The nature of the goods in respect of which they are used as trade marks.
(d) The similarity in the nature, character and performance of the goods of the rival traders.
_______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015
(e) The class of purchasers who are likely to buy the goods bearing the marks they require, on their
education and intelligence and a degree of care they are likely to exercise in purchasing and/or using
the goods.
(f) The mode of purchasing the goods or placing orders for the goods.
(g) Any other surrounding circumstances which may be relevant in the extent of dissimilarity
between the competing marks.
179. In Toyota Jidosha Kabushiki Kaisha Vs. Prius Auto Industries, (2018) 2 SCC 1, it was held that
an action for passing-off is premised on the right of the prior user generating a goodwill and is
unaffected by any registration of the mark under the Act. To prove and establish an action of
passing-off, three ingredients are required to be proved by the plaintiff ie. Goodwill,
misrepresentation and damages. Actual deception is not required [Century Traders Vs. Roshan Lal
Duggar & Co., AIR (1978) 250(DEL)].
180. In Eastman Photography Materials Company, Limited Vs. The Comptroller-General of Patents,
Designs, And Trade-Marks Respondent, [1898] A.C. 571, it was observed as follows:-
“We would add upon this point that we think that where any English word would be rejected as not
entitled to registration, no person ought to be permitted to register its translation into any other
_______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 language.
The question has been raised whether a word having the same sound as one entered on the register,
though differently spelt and with a different meaning, should be registered. The question in such a
case would seem to be whether the resemblance between the old mark and that applied for was such
as to be calculated to deceive; if it were it ought, of course, to be rejected.”
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103368932/ 32M/S.Veppolodai Chemicals vs Ds Spiceco Private Limited on 21 April, 2016
181. Lord Halsbury further observed as under:- “Of course also words which are merely mis-spelt,
but which are nevertheless, in sound, ordinary English words, and the use of which may tend to
deceive, ought not to be permitted.”
182. In Ruston Vs. Zamindara, AIR 1970 SC 1649, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that the test in
the case of passing-off is whether the defendant selling goods so marked is to be designed or is
calculated to lead purchasers to believe that they are the plaintiff's goods?”
183. In Oertli Vs. Bowman, 1957 RPC 388 (CA) (at p. 397), the gist of passing-off action was
explained by stating that it was essential to the success of any claim to passing-off based on the use
of given mark or get-up that the plaintiff should be able to show that the disputed mark or get-up
has become by user in the country distinctive of the plaintiff's goods so that the use in relation to any
goods of the kind dealt in by the plaintiff of that mark or get-up will be understood by the trade and
the public in that country as that of the goods of the plaintiff's goods. It _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 is in the nature of acquisition of
a quasi-proprietary right to the exclusive use of the mark or get-up in relation to goods of that kind
because of the plaintiff having used or made it known that the mark or get-up has relation to his
goods. Such right is invaded by anyone using the same or some deceptively similar mark, get-up or
name in relation to goods not of plaintiff. The three elements of passing-off action are the reputation
of goods, possibility of deception and likelihood of damages to the plaintiff. In our opinion, the same
principle, which applies to trade mark, is applicable to trade name.
184. In Satyam Infoway Ltd. Vs. Siffynet Solutions (P) Ltd., (2004) 6 SCC 145, the Hon’ble Supreme
Court was concerned with an invented / coined word “Sify” and held that in “An action for passing
off, as the phrase “passing off” itself suggests, is to restrain the defendant from passing-off its goods
or services to the public as that of the plaintiff's. It is an action not only to preserve the reputation of
the plaintiff but also to safeguard the public. The defendant must have sold its goods or offered its
services in a manner which has deceived or would be likely to deceive the public into thinking that
the defendant's goods or services are the plaintiff's. The action is normally available to the owner of
a distinctive trade mark and the person who, if the word or name is an invented one, invents and
uses it. If two trade rivals claim to have individually invented the same mark, then the trader who is
able to establish prior user will succeed. The question is, as has been aptly put, who gets these first?
It is not essential for the plaintiff to prove long user to establish reputation in a passing-off action. It
would depend upon the volume of sales and extent of advertisement. _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015
185. That apart, the Court has to view whether there is likelihood of confusion with the possible
injury to the public and consequential loss to the appellant. Similarity in the name may lead an
unwary user of internet of average intelligence and imperfect recollection to assume the business
connection between the two. Thus, to maintain a suit for passing- off, the plaintiff has to be
established that the mark is distinctive.
186. In order to show what amounts to sufficient business to amount to goodwill, the claimant
should show that it has sufficient goodwill in the form of customer base.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103368932/ 33M/S.Veppolodai Chemicals vs Ds Spiceco Private Limited on 21 April, 2016
187. In Laxmikant V. Patel Vs. Chetanbhai Shah, (2002) 3 SCC 65, the Hon’ble Supreme Court
observed as under:-
13. In an action for passing-off it is usual, rather essential, to seek an injunction, temporary or ad
interim. The principles for the grant of such injunction are the same as in the case of any other
action against injury complained of. The plaintiff must prove a prima facie case, availability of
balance of convenience in his favour and his suffering an irreparable injury in the absence of grant
of injunction. According to Kerly (ibid, para 16.16) passing-off cases are often cases of deliberate and
intentional misrepresentation, but it is well settled that fraud is not a necessary element of the right
of action, and the absence of an intention to deceive is not a defence, though proof of fraudulent
intention may materially assist a plaintiff in establishing probability of deception. Christopher
Wadlow in Law of Passing-Off (1995 Edn., at p. 3.06) states that the _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 plaintiff does not have to prove
actual damage in order to succeed in an action for passing-off. Likelihood of damage is sufficient.
The same learned author states that the defendant's state of mind is wholly irrelevant to the
existence of the cause of action for passingoff (ibid, paras 4.20 and 7.15). As to how the injunction
granted by the court would shape depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. Where a
defendant has imitated or adopted the plaintiff's distinctive trade mark or business name, the order
may be an absolute injunction that he would not use or carry on business under that name (Kerly,
ibid, para 16.97).
188. In JK Oil Industries Vs. Adani WilmarLtd., 2010 (42) PTC 639 (Del.), the Delhi High Court has
observed as follows:
“In order to bring home a tort of passing off, the plaintiff will have to establish and prove the
following: (i) the defendant has made a false representation or employed deception. Mere confusion
will not suffice; (ii) because of such false representation an unwary consumer is deceived, though
there is no necessity to prove intent; and (iii) lastly, the false representation has injured the
plaintiff"s goodwill and not just its reputation. 11.1 In sum and substance passing off is really a tort
of false representation whether intentional or unintentional whereby, one person attempts to sell his
goods or service as those manufactured or rendered by another, which is, "calculated" to damage the
goodwill of the other person. (See Erven Warnink BV vs Townend & Sons (Hull) Ltd 1980 RPC 31 at
page93). Therefore, for the plaintiff to _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 succeed, it will have to prove all three ingredients referred to
hereinabove. (See Island Trading vs Anchor Brewery 1989 RPC 287 at page 295).
189. In Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma Vs. Navaratna Pharmaceuticals Laboratories, (1965) 1
SCR 737:AIR 1965 SC 980, the Court recognised that passing-off is a Common Law remedy being in
substance an action for deceit, that is, a passing-off by a person of his own goods as that of another.
In the same decision, the Court held as follows:- “30. The mark of the respondent which he claimed
was infringed by the appellant was the mark ‘Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories’, and the mark
of the appellant which the respondent claimed was a colourable imitation of that mark is ‘Navaratna
Pharmacy’. Mr Agarwala here again stressed the fact that the ‘Navaratna’ which constituted an
essential part or feature of the Registered Trade Mark was a descriptive word in common use and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103368932/ 34M/S.Veppolodai Chemicals vs Ds Spiceco Private Limited on 21 April, 2016
that if the use of this word in the appellant's mark were disregarded there would not be enough
material left for holding that the appellant had used a trade mark which was deceptively similar to
that of the respondent. But this proceeds, in our opinion, on ignoring that the appellant is not, as we
have explained earlier, entitled to insist on a disclaimer in regard to that word by the respondent. In
these circumstances, the trade mark to be compared with that used by the appellant is the entire
registered mark including the word ‘Navaratna’. Even otherwise, as stated in a slightly different
context: [Kerly on Trade Marks 8th Edn. 407] “Where common marks are included in the trade
marks to be compared or in one of them, the proper _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 course is to look at the marks as
wholes and not to disregard the parts which are common”.”
190. In Registrar of Trade Marks Vs. Ashok Chandra Rakhit Ltd., (1955) 2 SCR 252 : AIR 1955 SC
558, in para 14, it has been held as follows:-
14. It is true that where a distinctive label is registered as a whole, such registration cannot possibly
give any exclusive statutory right to the proprietor of the trade mark to the use of any particular
word or name contained therein apart from the mark as a whole. As said by Lord Esher in Pinto v.
Badman [8 RPC 181 at p 191] :
“The truth is that the label does not consist of each particular part of it, but consists of the
combination of them all”.
Observations to the same effect will be found also in In re Apollinaris Company's Trade Marks [LR
(1891) 2 Ch 186] , In re Smokeless Powder Co., In re Clement and Cie [LR (1900) 1 Ch 114] and In re
Albert Baker & Company and finally in the Tudor case referred to above which was decided by
Sargant, J. This circumstance, however, does not necessarily mean that in such a case disclaimer
will always be unnecessary. It is significant that one of the facts which give rise to the jurisdiction of
the tribunal to impose disclaimer is that the trade mark contains parts which are not separately
registered. It is, therefore, clear that the section itself contemplates that there may be a disclaimer in
respect of parts contained in a trade mark registered as a whole although the registration of the
mark as a whole does _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.)
No.713 of 2015 not confer any statutory right with respect to that part.
191. In F. Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. Ltd. Vs. Geoffrey Manner & Co. (P) Ltd., (1969) 2 SCC 716 at
page 720, it was held as follows:-
“It is also important that the marks must be compared as wholes. It is not right to take a portion of
the word and say that because that portion of the word differs from the corresponding portion of the
word in the other case there is no sufficient, similarity to cause confusion.The true test is whether
the totality of the proposed trade mark is such that it is likely to cause deception or confusion or
mistake in the minds of persons accustomed to the existing trade mark.Thus,in Lavroma case
[Tokalon Ltd. v. Davidson & Co., 32 RPC at 133 at 136] Lord Johnston said: “… we are not bound to
scan the words as we would in a question of comparatioliterarum. It is not a matter for microscopic
inspection, but to be taken from the general and even casual point of view of a customer walking
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103368932/ 35M/S.Veppolodai Chemicals vs Ds Spiceco Private Limited on 21 April, 2016
into a shop.”
192. In Amritdhara Pharmacy Vs. Satya Deo Gupta, (1963) 2 SCR 484 : AIR 1963 SC 449, in para 8,
it was been held as follows:
“8. We agree that the use of the word “dhara” which literally means “current or stream” is not by
itself decisive of the matter. What we have to consider here is the overall similarity of the composite
words, having regard to the circumstance that the goods _______________
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 bearing the two names are
medicinal preparations of the same description. We are aware that the admission of a mark is not to
be refused, because unusually stupid people, “fools or idiots”, may be deceived. A critical
comparison of the two names may disclose some points of difference, but an unwary purchaser of
average intelligence and imperfect recollection would be deceived by the overall similarity of the two
names having regard to the nature of the medicine he is looking for with a somewhat vague
recollection that he had purchased a similar medicine on a previous occasion with a similar name.
The trade mark is the whole thing-the whole word has to be considered. In the case of the
application to register “Erectiks” (opposed by the proprietors of the trade mark “Erector”) Farwell,
J., said in William Bailey (Birmingham) Ltd. Application [(1935) 52 RPC 137] :
“I do not think it is right to take a part of the word and compare it with a part of the other word; one
word must be considered as a whole and compared with the other word as a whole…. I think it is a
dangerous method to adopt to divide the word up and seek to distinguish a portion of it from a
portion of the other word.””
135. There is also no scope for interring any confusion although the plaintiff has attempted to make
out a possible case for confusion to establish there is passing off. There is no confusion as the marks
are _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015
entirely different although they are used in the same industry. The plaintiff ought to have adopted a
mark which is distinctive.
136. The plaintiff ought to have noted that the word “Sprinkle” is not distinctive word. Having
adopted a word as a mark which is so common to the trade, the plaintiff cannot claim monopoly to
the exclusion of the defendants. The word “sprinkle” is common to the food industry especially in
the context of salts and spices.
137. In the light of the above discussions the issues framed are consoled as under:-
138. Issue No.1:- Whether the mark “SPRINKLERS” is distinctive and entitled to protection under
the Trade Marks Act, 1999? _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm.
Div.) No.713 of 2015 Answer:- It is irrelevant whether the word “Sprinkler” is distinctive and entitle
to protection under the Trade Marks Act, 1999. Both plaintiff and the defendants are entitled to
protection subject to the limitations of the registration. However, such registration will not give an
exclusive monopoly or right against each other.

139. Issue No.2:- Whether the plaintiff is the prior user of the Trademark “Sprinklers”?
Answer:- Although plaintiff has claimed to be using the mark since 1986, the
application that was filed by the plaintiff in 1993 claims to be user since 1986. This is
evident from the fact that the application that was originally filed on 08.03.1993 was
amended as the label which was subject matter of TM.No.592204 wrapper indicating
date of manufacture on 10/2001 as below:-

_______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 Therefore,
although the issue is answered as above it is of no significance as the plaintiff has no right against
the defendant. _______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of
2015
140. Issue No.3:- Whether the defendants is using the word “Sprinklers” as a mark in relation to its
goods?
Answer: There is no dispute that the defendants are using the word “Sprinklers” in
relation to not only iodised salt but also chat masala and pepper in Class
30. Therefore, Issue No.3 is answered accordingly.
141. Issue No.4:- Whether the plaintiff is entitled to relief in respect of alleged infringement?
Answer:- In the light of the above Issue No.4 is answered against the plaintiff.
142. Issue Nos.5 and 6:- Whether the defendants is passing off its goods as those of the plaintiff by
selling products by using the terms “Catch Sprinklers”? and Whether the defendants is passing off
its goods as those of the plaintiff by selling products by using the terms “Catch Sprinklers”?
_______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015 Answer:-
Both the plaintiff and the defendants are engaged in similar trade. The Question of passing off by
the defendants cannot be countenanced as the products are packaged differently. The plaintiff’s
product is sold in a polythene cover, whereas the defendants products are sold in a cylindrical
container wherein the word SPRINKLERS is used along with the registered Trademark CATCH in a
stylized font. The overall Trade Dress get-up, color scheme and the layout of the labels of the
plaintiff and the defendants are materially different. There is hardly any scope for any confusion.
That apart, the word “SPRINKLERS” and “SPRINKLE” are very common to the food industry. Salt
is sprinkled on the food to enhance test and therefore, the application that was originally filed by the
plaintiff itself was objected by the Trademark registry stating that the mark was descriptive.
Although the plaintiff has used the expression “Sprinkle” as a noun, the word “Sprinkle” is a verb
signifying an action. The word “Sprinkler” is also a verb.

_______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015
143. Issue No.7:Whether the parties are entitled to any other reliefs?
Answer: The defendant has admitted that they have been carrying business since
1987. The profits earned from this impugned sale using the deceptively similar
trademark ought to be surrendered to the plaintiff. The labels and pouches carrying
the impugned trademark ought to be destroyed and the defendants ought not to be
permitted to continue marketing the product under the impugned trademark
SPRINKLERS. The plaintiff is entitled to the legal costs incurred in the process of
prosecuting the suit from the beginning in 2015 till the date of decree and other costs
as this Hon’ble Court may deem fit and proper.
144. The Registrar of Trade Mark did not find the mark to be distinctive and had raised objection.
145. Although the defendant has been negligent and inconvenienced the Court, the plaintiff cannot
succeed merely because defendant has failed to produce the information that was available in a
proper manner. Court can order cost to be paid by the defendant for the negligence.
_______________ https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.S.(Comm. Div.) No.713 of 2015
146. Therefore, this Court is inclined to order cost payable by the defendants to a sum of
Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand Only) to the credit of the Adayar Cancer Institute.
147. With these observations and directions, the suit stands dismissed.
