CORAM : S.A. BOBDE &A.B. CHAUDHARI, JJ.
DATED : 27 th JULY, 2010.
ORAL JUDGMENT (Per S.A. Bobde, J.) :
Leave to amend. Amendment be carried out forthwith.
Amended slip be served on the respondents.
2. Rule. Rule returnable forthwith. Heard finally with the consent of learned counsel for parties.
3. The petitioner has challenged the order dated 22.1.2010 passed by the Caste Scrutiny Committee
invalidating the caste certificate to the effect that she belongs to Kanjar Bhat- Nomadic Tribe. The
main grievance of the petitioner is that the caste certificate to the effect that she belongs to Kanjar
Bhat-Nomadic Tribe ought not to have been invalidated in view of the undisputed fact that the
certificate of petitioner's sister to the same effect has been validated by the Caste Scrutiny
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123745415/ 2Apoorva vs Divisional Caste Certificate ... on 27 July, 2010
committee. According to learned counsel the sister is blood related from the paternal side and there
was no reason for invalidating the caste certificate of the petitioner. .
The learned counsel relied on the Govt. Resolution dated 22.8.2007 issued by the Principal
Secretary, Social Welfare Department, Govt. of Maharashtra, which provides that where during the
course of enquiry or scrutiny of a caste claim it is seen that the caste claim of a blood relative, such
as father, son, daughter, brother and sister has been scrutinized and accepted, the caste claim of the
applicant should be allowed without insisting on any other proof.
4. We have considered the matter and we are of the view that the petitioner's caste claim that she
belongs to Kanjar Bhat- Nomadic Tribe ought to have been accepted by the Committee merely on
the basis that identical caste claim of her sister that she belongs to Kanjar Bhat has been allowed by
the Committee, even apart from the Government Resolution.
We are of the opinion that the guidelines provided by the said Govt.
Resolution are sound and based on sound principles. It would indeed be chaotic otherwise. If the
relationship by blood is established or not doubted, and one such relative has been confirmed as
belonging to a particular caste, there is no reason why public time or money should be spent in the
committee testing the same evidence and making the same conclusion unless of course the
Committee finds on the evidence that the validity of the certificate of such relation has been
obtained by fraud.
5. The Division Bench of this Court in Mahesh Pralhadrao Lad v. State of Maharashtra - 2009(2)
Mh.L.J. 90 has observed that in the absence of any power under the Rules conferred on the
Government to issue a Govt. Resolution, the Govt. Resolution cannot be said to be binding on the
committee nor the committee in exercise of its jurisdiction is bound to follow the same. The Division
Bench further observed that the Government Resolution may be considered in the context of Rule 12
of the Rules and if the committee while exercising jurisdiction is satisfied that the caste validity
certificate issued to a blood relative is genuine then instead of calling the Vigilance Cell Report it
may proceed to issue the caste validity certificate. We are in respectful agreement with the view
taken by the Division Bench. We would further add that the committee would be entitled to refuse to
follow the caste validity certificate granted to a blood relative if it appears to the committee that the
earlier caste certificate has been scrutinized by a Committee without jurisdiction or the validity
order is obtained by committing fraud on the Committee.
6. The Supreme Court has laid down this position in the judgment in Raju Ramsing Vasave v.
Mahesh Deorao Bhivapurkar & ors. - (2008) 9 SCC 54. Para 30 to 38 of the said judgment reads as
follows :
"30. The principle of res judicata is undoubtedly a salutary principle. Even a wrong
decision would attract the principle of res judicata. The said principle, however,
amongst others, has some exceptions e.g. when a judgment is passed without
jurisdiction, when the matter involves a pure question of law or when the judgment
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123745415/ 3Apoorva vs Divisional Caste Certificate ... on 27 July, 2010
has been obtained by committing fraud on the court.
31. In Williams v. Lourdusamy this Court stated the law, thus : (SCC p.650, para 11) "11. The
principles of res judicata although provide for a salutary principle that no person shall be harassed
again and again, have its own limitations. In OS No.402 of 1987, Respondent no.2 was not
impleaded as a party.
In his absence therefore the issue as to whether respondent 2 had entered into an oral agreement of
sale or not could not have been adjudicated upon. The said court had no jurisdiction in that behalf.
If that was decided in the said suit, the findings would have been nullities."
32. Two legal principles which would govern a case of this nature are :
(i) A decision rendered without jurisdiction being a nullity, the principle of res
judicata shall not apply.
(ii) If a fraud has been committed on the court, no benefit therefrom can be claimed
on the basis thereof or otherwise.
33. In support of the first principle, we may at the outset refer to Chief Justice of A.P. v. L.V.A.
Dixitulu wherein this Court, while discussing the effect of Section 11 CPC on a pure question of law
or a decision given by a court without jurisdiction, opined : (SCC p. 42, para 24) "24.... Moreover,
this is a pure question of law depending upon the interpretation of Article 371-D.
If the argument holds good, it will make the decision of the Tribunal as having been given by an
authority suffering from inherent lack of jurisdiction. Such a decision cannot be sustained merely by
the doctrine of res judicata or estoppel as urged in this case."
34. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Ashok Leyland Ltd. v.
State of T.N. held : (SCC p. 44, para 118) "118. The principle of res judicata is a procedural provision.
A jurisdictional question, if wrongly decided, would not attract the principle of res judicata. When
an order is passed without jurisdiction, the same becomes a nullity. When an order is a nullity, it
cannot be supported by invoking the procedural principles like estoppel, waivers or res judicata.
(See also Dwarka Prasad Agarwal v. B.D. Agarwal; Union of India v.
Pramod Gupta and National Institute of Technology v.
Niraj Kumar Singh).
35. So far as the second principle, noticed by us, is concerned, there is no dearth of authority. Fraud
vitiates all solemn acts. When an order has been obtained by practising fraud on the court, it would
be a nullity.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123745415/ 4Apoorva vs Divisional Caste Certificate ... on 27 July, 2010
36. In Ganpatbhai Mahijibhai Solanki v. State of Gujarat this Court held:
"It is now a well-settled principle that fraud vitiates all solemn acts. If an order is
obtained by reason of commission of fraud, even the principles of natural justice are
not required to be complied with for setting aside the same."
It was further observed :
"In T. Vijendradas v. M. Subramanian this Court held: (SCC p. 766, paras 27-28) "27. .... When a
fraud is practised on a court, the same is rendered a nullity. In a case of nullity, even the principles
of natural justice are not required to be complied with. (Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan v. Ajay
Kumar Das and A. Umarani v. Registrar, Coop. Socities).
28. Once it is held that by reason of commission of a fraud, a decree is rendered to be void rendering
all subsequent proceedings taken pursuant thereto also nullity, in our opinion, it would be wholly
inequitable to confer a benefit on a party who is a beneficiary thereunder."
37. In K.D. Sharam v. Steel Authority of India Ltd. this Court opined:
"Reference was also made to a recent decision of this Court in A.V.
Papayya Sastry v. Government of A.P. Considering English and Indian cases, one of us (C.K.
Thakkar, J.) stated : (SCC p. 231, para 22) `22. It is thus settled proposition of law that a judgment,
decree or order obtained by playing fraud on the court, tribunal or authority is a nullity and non est
in the eye of the law. Such a judgment, decree or order- by the first court or by the final court- has to
be treated as nullity by every court, superior or inferior. It can be challenged in any court, at any
time, in appeal, revision, writ or even in collateral proceedings.' The Court defined fraud as an act of
deliberate deception with the design of securing something by taking unfair advantage of another. In
fraud one gains at the loss and cost of another.
Even the most solemn proceedings stand vitiated if they are actuated by fraud. Fruad is thus an
extrinsic collateral act which vitiates all judicial acts, whether in rem or in personam."
7. We thus come to the conclusion that when during the course of enquiry the candidate submits a
caste validity certificate granted earlier certifying that a blood relation of the candidate belongs to
the same caste as that claimed by the applicant, the committee may grant such certificate without
calling for Vigilance Cell Report. However, if the committee finds that the earlier caste certificate is
tainted by fraud or is granted without jurisdiction, the Committee may refuse to follow and may
refuse to grant certificate to the applicant before it.
8. Mr.Manohar, amicus curiae who assisted in the matter, submitted that the decision on the caste
claim does not affect that person alone but has an impact on the future generation where the caste
claim has been wrongly accepted or rejected. He, therefore, submitted that the committee must in
all cases issue notice to the blood relatives who have wrongly or fraudulently obtained the caste
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123745415/ 5Apoorva vs Divisional Caste Certificate ... on 27 July, 2010
certificate or obtained the certificate without jurisdiction in the committee to grant it and initiate
proceedings to cancel that certificate. Referring to the decision in Indian Bank v. Satyam Fibres
(India) Pvt. Ltd. - (1996) 5 SCC 550 where the Supreme Court while dealing with a case under
Consumer Protection Act,1986 and the power of National Commission held that the Commission
has inherent power to recall the judgment and order obtained by fraud.
The Supreme Court further observed vide para 20 of the aforesaid judgment thus :
" This plea could not have been legally ignored by the Commission which needs to be
reminded that the authorities, be they constitutional, statutory or administrative,
(and particularly those who have to decide a lis) possess the power to recall their
judgments or orders if they are obtained by fraud as fraud and justice never dwell
together (Fraus et jus nunquam cohabitant). It has been repeatedly said that fraud
and deceit defend or excuse no man (Fraus et dolus neminin patrocinari debent)."
The position of law pointed out by the learned amicus curiae is undoubtedly correct but we are not
called upon to decide whether the committee ought to have exercised such power in the present
case.
9. In the present case, we find that the committee has disbelieved the petitioner's case that she
belongs to Kanjar Bhat after calling the school leaving certificate of petitioner's father and noticing
that the original caste written on it was `Thakur' and that was subsequently changed to Kanjar Bhat.
The committee observed that the caste has been changed without complying with the procedure
prescribed by Section 48(e) and 132(3) of Mumbai Primary Education Act. In fact, the caste has
been changed on the basis of the affidavit. From the findings of the committee it appears that the
committee has observed that the change of caste has been done illegally. Obviously, the committee
which decided the caste claim of the petitioner's sister did not hold the same view, otherwise it
would have refused to grant validity. In the circumstances, we are of the view that the committee
which has expressed a doubt about the validity of caste claim of the petitioner and has described it
as a mistake in its order, ought not to have arrived at a different conclusion. The matters pertaining
to validity of caste have a great impact on the candidate as well as on the future generations in many
matters varying from marriage to education and enjoyment, and therefore where a committee has
given a finding about the validity of the caste of a candidate another committee ought not to refuse
the same status to a blood relative who applies. A merely different view on the same facts would not
entitle the committee dealing with the subsequent caste claim to reject it. There is, however, no
doubt as observed by us earlier that if a committee is of the view that the earlier certificate is
obtained by fraud it would not be bound to follow the earlier caste validity certificate and is entitled
to refuse the caste claim and also in addition initiate proceedings for cancellation of the earlier
order. In this view of the matter, we are of the view that the petition must succeed. Rule is made
absolute in above terms. The Caste Scrutiny Committee is directed to furnish the caste validity
certificate to the petitioner.
10. We record our appreciation for the assistance rendered by Mr.Manohar, amicus curiae.
