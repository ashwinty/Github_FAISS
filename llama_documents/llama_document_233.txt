ORDER
S.R.K. Prasad, J.
1. These two revisions are directed against the judgments rendered in R.A.Nos.129 of 2000 and 229
of 2000 by the Additional Chief Judge, City Small Causes Court, Hyderabad.
2. The facts that arise for consideration can be briefly stated as follows:
Eviction Petition in R.C.No.621 of 1998 was presented against the tenant by the
landlord before the II Additional Rent Controller, Hyderabad. It is being contested by
the tenant. The landlord has claimed that the tenant has committed wilful default in
payment of rents and also sought for bona fide requirement of the premises. During
the pendency of the petition, I.A.No.500 of 1999 has been presented under Section
11(1) of the Andhra Pradesh Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1960,
(hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') to direct the tenant to pay or deposit arrears of
rent from 16.4.1998 to 30.9.1999 at Rs.900/- and also future rents. Thereupon, the
lower court marked the written statement of the defendant in O.S.No.2020 of 1998
and allowed the application with a direction to deposit Rs.100/- per month being the
admitted rent. Aggrieved by the same, the tenant has carried the matter in appeal
before the Additional Chief Judge, City Small Causes Court at Hyderabad. The
appellate authority in R.A.No.229 of 2000 has confirmed the order of the Rent
Controller. Thereupon, the tenant has preferred C.R.P.No.3975 of 2002 against
R.A.No.229 of 2000. In the meanwhile, the landlord has presented I.A.No.136 of
2000 in I.A.No.500 of 1999 in R.C.No.621 of 1998 under Section 11(4) of the Act
before the II Additional Rent Controller, Hyderabad to stop all further proceedings
and deliver possession. Thereupon, the Rent Controller has directed the tenant to put
the landlord in possession of the schedule premises within one month by stopping all
further proceedings in R.C.No.621 of 1998. The tenant once again carried the matter
in appeal before the Additional Chief Judge, City Small Causes Court, Hyderabad, in
respect of the said orders passed in I.A.No.136 of 2000. The appellate authority in
R.A.No.129 of 2000 has confirmed the order of the Rent Controller. Aggrieved by the
same, the tenant once again preferred C.R.P.No.3928 of 2002. Hence, these two

revisions are being disposed of together by a common order.
3. The short point that arises for consideration is whether the order directing the tenant to deposit
the alleged admitted rent and also directing the tenant to put the landlord in possession is in
accordance with the provisions of Section 11 of the Act.
4. It is noticed by this Court that no documentary evidence is produced. It is an admitted fact that
the present landlord purchased the said premises subsequently. Before adverting to the contentions,
it is necessary to have a look at provisions of Section 11 of the Act, which reads as follows:
"11. Payment or deposit of rent during the pendency of proceedings for eviction:-
(1) No tenant against whom an application for eviction has been made by a landlord
under Section 10, shall be entitled to contest the application before the Controller
under that section or to prefer any appeal under Section 20 against any order made
by the Controller on the application, unless he has paid to the landlord or deposits
with the Controller or the appellate authority, as the case may be, all arrears of rent
due in respect of the building up to the date of payment or deposit and continues to
pay or deposit any rent which may subsequently become due in respect of the
building, until the termination of the proceedings before the Controller or the
appellate authority, as the case may be.
(2) The deposit of rent under sub-section (1) shall be made within the time and in the
manner prescribed.
(3) Where there is any dispute as to the amount or rent to be paid or deposited under
sub-section (1) the Controller or the appellate authority, as the case may be, shall on
application made to him either by the tenant or by the landlord, and after making
such inquiry as he deems necessary, determine summarily the rent to be so paid or
deposited.
(4) If any tenant fails to pay or to deposit the rent as aforesaid, the Controller or the
appellate authority, as the case may be, shall, unless the tenant shows sufficient cause
to the contrary, stop all further proceedings and make an order directing the tenant
to put the landlord in possession of the building.
(5) The amount deposited under sub-section (1) may, subject to such conditions as
may be prescribed, be withdrawn by the landlord on application made by him in that
behalf to the Controller or the appellate authority, as the case may be."
5. The learned counsel for the revision petitioner Sri Koka Raghava Rao mainly contends that the
tenant was depositing the rents before the Rent Controller in earlier proceedings and there is no
need to give a direction to deposit once again. Whereas, the learned counsel appearing for the
landlord contends that the deposit made in the prior proceedings does not amount to sufficient
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32619827/ 2A. Yeshoda W/O. A. Chandriah vs Digamber Rao Surve S/O. Late Manik Rao on 8 December, 2004
compliance and it amount to wilful default. In any view of the matter, that has to be adjudicated
only in the main application.
6. The only point that has to be considered is whether there is any dispute as to the rent to be paid or
deposited and if so whether the court has determined summarily the rent to be so paid. The Rent
Controller in his order passed in I.A.No.500 of 1999 has stated as under:
"The quantum of rent is in dispute. There is no evidence to decide this point as such I
feel that it can be decided during the enquiry of main R.C."
Having observed that quantum of rent is in dispute, it went on to consider about the depositing of
rent at the rate Rs.100/- per month. It is contemplated under Section 11(3) of the Act that the Rent
Controller is bound to make enquiry and determine summarily the rent to be so paid or deposited. If
such enquiry is not conducted, it will not amount to sufficient compliance of the provision of Section
11(3) of the Act. It does not contemplate relegating the enquiry to the main application. Moreover,
the court itself has observed that the quantum of rent is in dispute and there is no evidence to decide
this point as such it can be decided during the enquiry in the main R.C. That means when evidence
has not been placed to determine the quantum of rent, he ought to have dismissed the application
rather than proceed to fix the rent without any basis. Moreover, the person who presented the
application has not produced the sale deed. He is bound to produce his title deed and show that he is
landlord. It is a case where the tenant has denied title of the landlord as well as attornment to the
new landlord. He has also denied the quantum of rent. Without adjudicating all these things, it
cannot be said that the tenant has to pay the said amount. Section 11(3) of the Act contemplates that
rent has to be determined in a summary way. Both the Rent Controller as well as the appellate
authority, which confirmed the order of the court below, has failed to follow the statutory provision
under Section 11(3) of the Act. The ordering of deposit of admitted rent which amount sufficient
compliance as mentioned in decisions reported in Ghouse Mohiuddin v. Dr.L.Bhaskar Reddy, and
M.Gopala Krishna v. N.G. Veerabhadra Swamy, will not apply to the facts of this case as there is no
admitted rent here since the ownership of the landlord as well as the stipulation of the rent is
denied. There cannot be any dispute that notice is not necessary before presenting the rent control
application and it has been clearly stated by the Apex Court in V.Dhanapal Chettiar v. Yesodai
Ammal, . The relevant paras in 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 and 19 read as follows:
"11. The first decision of this Court which is necessary to be noticed on the point of
notice is the case of Punjalal v. Bhagwatprasad, . The case related to Bombay Rent
Act. Raghubar Dayal J. speaking on behalf of the Division Bench of this Court
expressed the view at p. 318 thus; -
"We are therefore of opinion that where a tenant is in possession under a lease from
the landlord, he is not to be evicted for a cause which would give rise to a suit for
recovery of possession under S. 12 if his tenancy has not been determined already. It
follows that whenever a tenant acts in a way which would remove the bar on the
landlord's right to evict him it is necessary for the landlord to serve him with a notice
determining his tenancy and also serve him with a notice under sub-s. (2) of Section
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32619827/ 3A. Yeshoda W/O. A. Chandriah vs Digamber Rao Surve S/O. Late Manik Rao on 8 December, 2004
12 of the Act."
It is true that the Rent Act is intended to restrict the right which the landlord possessed either for
charging excessive rents or for evicting tenants. But if within the ambit of those restricted rights he
makes out his case it is a mere empty formality to ask him to determine the contractual tenancy
before institution of a suit for eviction. As we have pointed out above, this was necessary under the
Transfer of Property Act as mere termination of the lease entitled the landlord to recover possession.
But under the Rent Control Acts it becomes an unnecessary technicality to insist that the landlord
must determine the contractual tenancy. It is of no practical use after so many restrictions of his
right to evict the tenant have been put. The restricted area under the various State Rent Acts has
done away to a large extent with the requirement of the law of contract and the Transfer of Property
Act. If this be so why unnecessarily, illogically and unjustifiably a formality of terminating the
contractual lease should be insisted upon? In Punjalal's case, if we may say so with very great
respect, the principle of law laid down by this Court in Brij Raj Krishna's case (supra) and by the
Punjab High Court in Hem Chand's case was wrongly distinguished. After quoting the passage from
the former it was said at page 322: -
"In the present case, S. 12 of the Act is differently worded and cannot therefore be
said to be a complete Code in itself. There is nothing in it which overrides the
provisions of the Transfer of Property Act." The difference in the wordings of Sec. 11
of the Bihar Act and Section 12 of the Bombay Act does not justify the conclusion that
the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act have not been overridden by Section 12
of the Bombay Act reading it with Section 13 etc. This was the ground given for
distinguishing Hem Chand's case also by erroneously pointing out the distinction
between Section 13 (1) of the Delhi and Ajmer Merwara Rent Control Act, 1952 and
the Bombay Act. In our considered judgment Punjalal's case was not correctly
decided.
13. The decision of this Court in the case of Mangilal v. Suganchand, , being a
decision of a Constitution Bench consisting of five learned and eminent Judges of this
Court requires careful consideration. Therein it was held at page 244 with reference
to Section 4 of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1955 thus: -
"The Accommodation Act does not in any way abrogate Ch. V of the Transfer of
Property Act which deals with leases of immovable property. The requirement of S.
106 of the Transfer of Property Act is that a lease from month to month can be
terminated only after giving fifteen days' notice expiring with the end of a month of
the tenancy either by the landlord to the tenant or by the tenant to the landlord. Such
a notice is essential for bringing to an end the relationship of landlord and tenant.
Unless the relationship is validly terminated the landlord does not get the right to
obtain possession of the premises by evicting the tenant. Section 106 of the Transfer
of Property Act does not provide for the satisfaction of any additional requirements.
But then, S. 4 of the Accommodation Act steps in and provides that unless one of the
several grounds set out therein is established or exists, the landlord cannot evict the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32619827/ 4A. Yeshoda W/O. A. Chandriah vs Digamber Rao Surve S/O. Late Manik Rao on 8 December, 2004
tenant." Section 4 of the Madhya Pradesh Rent Act, 1955 provided that no suit could
be filed in any Civil Court against a tenant for his eviction for any accommodation
except on one or more grounds set out in that section. The corresponding provision
in Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Act of 1961 is contained in Section 12 which
starts with a non obstante clause also but the definition of the tenant as in other State
Acts includes "any person continuing in possession after the termination of his
tenancy." How then is it correct to say that a notice is essential for bringing to an end
the relationship between the landlord and the tenant? The notice does not bring to an
end such a relationship because of the protection given to the tenant under the Rent
Act. If that be so then it is not necessary for the landlord to terminate the contractual
relationship to obtain possession of the premises for evicting the tenant. If the
termination of the contractual tenancy by notice does not, because of the Rent Act
provisions, entitle the landlord to recover possession and he becomes entitled, only if
he makes out a case under the special provision of the State Rent Act, then, in our
opinion, termination of the contractual relationship by a notice is not necessary. The
termination comes into effect when a case is successfully made out for eviction of the
tenant under the State Rent Act. We say with utmost respect that on the point of
requirement of a notice under S. 106 of the Transfer of Property Act Mangilal's case
was not correctly decided.
14. In Manujendra Dutt v. Purendu Prosad Roy Chowdhury , the question of notice
came to be considered with reference to the Calcutta Thika Tenancy Act, 1949 and in
that connection it was said at page 480 :-
"The Thika Tenancy Act like similar Rent Acts passed in different States is intended
to prevent indiscriminate eviction of tenants and is intended to be a protective statute
to safeguard security of possession of tenants and therefore should be construed in
the light of its being a social legislation. What Section 3 therefore does is to provide
that even where a landlord has terminated the contractual tenancy by a proper notice
such landlord can succeed in evicting his tenant provided that he falls under one or
more of the clauses of that section." For the reasons already stated we do not agree,
and we say so with respect, with the above enunciation of law. This apart there is
scope for distinguishing Manujendra's case because Clause 7 of the lease deed therein
ran as follows: -
"Provided always and it is hereby agreed and declared that if it be required that
thelessee should vacate the said premises at the end of the said term of 10 years the
lessee will be served with a 6 months notice ending with the expiry of the said term
and it is further agreed that if the lessee is permitted to hold over the land after the
expiry of the said term of 10 years the lessee will be allowed a six months notice to
quit and vacate the said premises."
Over and above the protection under the Thika Tenancy Act Cl. 7 of the lease deed gave an extra
protection of getting six months notice to quit and vacate the premises. In that event one can say
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32619827/ 5A. Yeshoda W/O. A. Chandriah vs Digamber Rao Surve S/O. Late Manik Rao on 8 December, 2004
that such a clause being not unlawful and giving an extra protection to the tenant against eviction
must also be adhered to. But it is not correct to say that S. 106 of the Transfer of Property Act merely
providing for termination of a lease either by the lessor or the lessee by giving the requisite notice is
an extra protection against eviction. The purpose of this provision is merely to terminate the
contract which the overriding Rent Acts do not permit to be terminated.
15. In Ravals' case (supra) the question for consideration was whether Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu
Rent Act providing for an application for fixation of fair rent was available both to the tenant and the
landlord. The majority speaking through Alagiriswami J. took the view that it was so. A contrary
view was expressed by Bhagwati J. speaking for the minority. While discussing this question the
relevant passage from the decision of this Court in Brij Raj Krishna's case was quoted at p. 634 and
reference was made to the decision of the Punjab High Court in Hem Chand's case. Thereafter the
observation of this Court in Punjalal's case to the effect that "Rent Acts are not ordinarily intended
to interfere with contractual leases and are Acts for the protection of tenants and are consequently
restrictive and not enabling, conferring no new rights of action but restricting the existing rights
either under the contract or under the general law," were held not to apply to all Rent Acts
irrespective of the scheme of those Acts and their provisions. This observation given with reference
to the dictum of this Court in Punjalal's case concerned with the question of notice under Section
106. It enabled certain High Courts to make a firm departure and take the view with reference to the
scheme of their respective State Acts to say that a notice was not necessary. This happened in
Madras, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka and Punjab and Haryana. Alagiriswami J. at page 635
after having made that observation with reference to Bhaiya Punjalal's case has said - "Be that as it
may, we are now concerned with the question of fixation of a fair rent." In our opinion the majority
decision with regard to Section 4 was undoubtedly correct and the minority stretched the law, if we
may say so with respect, too far to hold that Section 4 was not available to the landlord. It should be
remembered, as we have said above, that the field of freedom of contract was encroached upon to a
very large extent by the State Rent Acts. The encroachment was not entirely and wholly one sided.
Some encroachment was envisaged in the interest of the landlord also and equity and justice
demanded a fair play on the part of the legislature not to completely ignore the helpless situation of
many landlords who are also compared to some big tenants sometimes weaker section of the society.
As for example a widow or a minor lets out a family house in a helpless situation to tide over the
financial difficulty and later wants a fair rent to be determined. Again suppose for instance in a city
there is an apprehension of external aggression, severe internal disturbances or spread of epidemics.
A man in possession of his house may go to another town letting out his premises to a tenant
financially strong and of strong nerves at a rate comparatively much lower than the prevailing
market rates. Later on, on the normalization of the situation as against the agreed rate of rent he
approaches the Building Controller for fixing a fair rent in accordance with a particular State Rent
Act. Why should she or he be debarred from doing so. The Statute gives him the protection and
enables the Controller to intervene to fix a fair rent as against the term of contract between the
parties. In a large number of cases it is the tenant who gets this protection. But in some as in the
case of Raval the landlord needs and gets the protection. But this is not a direct authority on the
point of notice.

16. In Isha Valimohamad v. Haji Gulam Mohamad and Haji Dada Trust , Mathew J. speaking for a
Division Bench of this Court had to consider the question with reference to the Saurashtra Rent
Control Act, 1951. In that connection it was observed at page 726 that the High Court was right in
the assumption that a notice under the Transfer of Property Act was necessary to terminate the
tenancy on the ground that the appellants had sublet the premises. Says the learned judge further
that the landlord could not have issued a notice under any of the provisions of the Transfer of
Property Act to determine the tenancy on the ground of sub-letting by the tenant. It is not correct to
assume that a notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act as required by clause (h) of
Section 111 needs a ground to be made out for the termination of the tenancy. Such a view could be
taken only under clause (g). Beg J. as he then was in P. J. Gupta and Co. v. K. Venkatesan speaking
for himself and Krishna Iyer J. following Raval's case observed at p. 403: -
"In other words, the special procedure provided by the Act displaces the
requirements of the procedure for eviction under the Transfer of Property Act and by
an ordinary civil suit. Therefore, we need not concern ourselves with the provisions of
Transfer of Property Act.... .... ..... ...... ....... ...........
A tenancy is essentially based on and governed by an agreement or contract even
when a statute intervenes to limit the area within which an agreement or contract
operates, or, subjects contractual rights to statutory rights and obligations." In
Dattonpant Gopalvarao v. Vithabrao Maruthirao, 1975 Supp SCR 67 one of us
(Untwalia J.) speaking on behalf of himself and Krishna Iyer J. said at page 71: -
"We do not think that the alternative argument put forward by Mr. Chitaley that no
notice was necessary in this case is correct. The appellant was a contractual tenant
who would have become a statutory tenant within the meaning of clause (r) of
Section 2 of the Act if he would have continued in possession after the termination of
the tenancy in his favour. Otherwise not. Without termination of the contractual
tenancy by a valid notice or other mode set out in Section 111 T. P. Act it was not open
to the landlord to treat the appellant as a statutory tenant and seek his eviction
without service of a notice to quit."
On a careful consideration and approach of the matter in the instant case we think that we cannot
approve of the view expressed in the passage extracted above. In Batan Lal v. Vardesh Chander ,
Krishna Iyer J. delivered the judgment on behalf of a Bench of this Court consisting of himself,
Chandrachud J., as he then was and Gupta J. The case related to a building in Delhi. The Court was
concerned with clause (g) of the Section 111 of the Transfer of Property Act. Tracing the history of
the legislation it was pointed out by the Court at page 918 that the requirement as to written notice
provided in Section 111 (g) cannot be said to be based on any general rule of equity and therefore
forfeiture of lease brought about in terms of Section 111 (g) of the Transfer of Property Act not by
notice but on the application of justice, equity and good conscience was held to be good
determination of the lease. Quoting from Manujendra's case it was said at page 911:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32619827/ 7A. Yeshoda W/O. A. Chandriah vs Digamber Rao Surve S/O. Late Manik Rao on 8 December, 2004
"We are inclined to hold that the landlord in the present case cannot secure an order
for eviction without first establishing that he has validly determined the lease under
the T. P. Act."
Why this dual requirement? Even if the lease is determined by a forfeiture under the Transfer of
Property Act the tenant continues to be a tenant, that is to say, there is no forfeiture in the eye of
law. The tenant becomes liable to be evicted and forfeiture comes into play only if he has incurred
the liability to be evicted under the State Rent Act, not otherwise. In many State Statutes different
provisions have been made as to the grounds on which a tenant can be evicted and in relation to his
incurring the liability to be so evicted. Some provisions overlap those of the Transfer of Property
Act. Some are new which are mostly in favour of the tenants but some are in favour of the landlord
also. That being so the dictum of this Court in Brij Raj case comes into play and one has to look to
the provisions of law contained in the four corners of any State Rent Act to find out whether a tenant
can be evicted or not. The theory of double protection or additional protection, it seems to us, has
been stretched too far and without a proper and due consideration of all its ramifications. 18. Lastly
our attention was drawn to the decision of this Court in Firm Sardarilal Vishwanath v. Pritam Singh
. The lease in that case had come to an end by efflux of time. A tenant continued in possession and
become a socalled statutory tenant. The argument put forward before this Court that a fresh notice
under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act was necessary was rejected on the ground: -
"Having examined the matter on authority and precedent it must be frankly
confessed that no other conclusion is possible on the first principle. Lease of urban
immovable property represents a contract between the lessor and the lessee. If the
contract is to be put to an end it has to be terminated by a notice to quit as envisaged
under S. 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. But it is equally clear as provided by S.
111 of the Transfer of Property Act that the lease of immovable property determines
by various modes therein prescribed. Now, if the lease of immovable property
determines in any one of the modes prescribed under S. 111, the contract of lease
comes to an end, and the landlord can exercise his right of re-entry. This right of
re-entry is further restricted and fettered by the provisions of the Rent Restriction
Act. Nonetheless the contract of lease had expired and the tenant lessee continues in
possession under the protective wing of the Rent Restricting Act until the lessee loses
protection. But there is no question of terminating the contract because the contract
comes to an end once the lease determines in any one of the modes prescribed under
S.111. There is, therefore, no question of giving a notice to quit to such a lessee who
continued in possession after the determination of the lease, i.e. after the contract
came to an end under the protection of the Rent Restriction Act. If the contract once
came to an end there was no question of terminating the contract over again by a
fresh notice."
If we were to agree with the view that determination of lease in accordance with the Transfer of
Property Act is a condition precedent to the starting of a proceeding under the State Rent Act for
eviction of the tenant, we could have said so with respect that the view expressed in the above
passage is quite correct because there was no question of determination of the lease again once it
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/32619827/ 8A. Yeshoda W/O. A. Chandriah vs Digamber Rao Surve S/O. Late Manik Rao on 8 December, 2004
was determined by efflux of time. But on the first assumption we have taken a different view of the
matter and have come to the conclusion that determination of a lease in accordance with the
Transfer of Property Act is unnecessary and a mere surplusage because the landlord cannot get
eviction of the tenant even after such determination. The tenant continues to be so even thereafter.
That being so, making out a case under the Rent Act for eviction of the tenant by itself is sufficient
and it is not obligatory to found the proceeding on the basis of the determination of the lease by
issue of notice in accordance with Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act.
19. For the reasons stated above we hold that the High Court was right in its view that no notice to
quit was necessary under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act in order to enable the landlady
- respondent to get an order of eviction against the tenant-appellant. But we were told by learned
counsel for the appellant that he had some more points to urge before the High Court to challenge
the order of eviction. We do not find from the judgment of the High Court that the appellant was
prevented from supporting the orders of the courts below in his favour by urging any other point. No
point of substance could be indicated before us which was worth consideration after a clear and
definite finding by the Appellate Court that the respondent required the premises bona fide for a
personal necessity. We do not think it advisable to delay the proceeding any further and send back
the case to the High Court on this account. We accordingly dismiss the appeal but in the
circumstances direct the parties to bear their own costs throughout."
7. It is also clearly stated in Smt. Arnavaz Rustom Printer, Mumbai v. N.D. Thadani, that Court has
got jurisdiction to order eviction of tenant under sub-section (4) of Section 11 of the Act, which is
mandatory. It is also clearly stated in Soorampally Venkata Reddy v. New Tirumala Emporium, that
the order passed by the appellate authority under Section 20 confirming the order of Rent
Controller under Section 11(4) is executable under Section 15 of the Act. The matter has to be looked
through a different angle in this case. The lower court has not looked into the provision of Section
11(3) of the Act and did not consider the determination of the rent. Ordering enquiry in the main
R.C., is beyond the scope of Section 11(3) of the Act. The order of the Rent Controller directing the
tenant to deposit admitted rent and the consequential order to put the landlord in possession of the
schedule premises are liable to be set aside and they are, accordingly, set aside. The matter is sent
back to the Rent Controller to determine the rent in the application summarily as adumbrated under
Section 11(3) of the Act and dispose of the case in accordance with law. It is also stated that the main
R.C., is of the year 1998. I am of the considered view that both main case as well as the applications
is to be disposed of at one and the same time, which will meet the ends of justice.
8. In the result, the learned II Additional Rent Controller, Hyderabad is directed to dispose of
I.A.No.500 of 1999 and I.A.No.136 of 2000 at one and the same along with R.C.No.621 of 1998.
Before taking up the case, the Rent Controller is directed to make an effort to bring about settlement
through Lok Adalat and soon after receipt of the record from Lok Adalat, he shall dispose of the
same within a period of two months.
Both revisions are allowed accordingly. No costs.
