JUDGMENT:
The applicant Shri Vanit Gupta, who is not a party to the above arbitration petition, has filed this
Notice of Motion. The Arbitration Petition is filed under section 9 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short "the Act") by the petitioner - JSW Steel Ltd. (referred as Petitioner),
against the original respondent no. 1 - Delta Iron & Steel Co. Pvt. Ltd., respondent no. 2 - Yatin
Steels India Pvt. Ltd. and respondent no. 3 - ARK Industries Pvt. Ltd. (referred as Respondents).
The applicant is a third party to the transactions which have taken place between the petitioner and
the This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 3 nmcdl

2044-19.odt respondents pertaining to sale of iron coils (for short 'the goods') to the respondents.
2. The petitioner approached this Court in the above Petition filed under section 9 of the Act,
principally on the ground that there is a Franchise Agreement dated 1 July 2018 entered between
the petitioner and the respondents. The contention of the petitioner is that as clear from the various
clauses of the Franchise Agreement, the respondents were under an obligation to make payments
within 7 days from the date of invoice, in cases where the material was dispatched from the
Vijaynagar plant and within 7 days from the date of invoice date in cases where the said material
was dispatched from the Dolvi plant. The petitioner has contended that between April and June,
2019, the respondents placed 17 purchase orders with the petitioner for a supply of 23516 MT (mega
tons) of these goods, for total principal amount of Rs.121,35,85,585/-. The petitioner contended that
on the date of filing of the petition, under the invoices for the said period between April and June
2019, amounts remained outstanding and payable by the respondents to the petitioner and
particularly since July 2019 a total principal amount of Rs.20,39,90,685/- was due and payable by
the respondents to the petitioner. Exhibit B to the petition is a tabular representation of the
payments to be made by the respondents against the This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking
to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 4 nmcdl 2044-19.odt invoices raised by the petitioner, including
the dates on which the same fell due. It is on the above premise, the present Section 9 petition was
filed and moved for urgent ad-interim orders.
3. The petitioner had moved the Arbitration Petition for ex-parte reliefs against the respondents. On
23 August 2019 this Court (K.R. Shriram, J.) passed an order interalia granting the petitioner
ad-interim relief in terms of prayer clauses (k) and (l) of the petition. The said order reads as under:
"1. At the outset, Mr.Khambata, senior Advocate for petitioner tenders draft
amendment to the petition which is taken on record and marked `X' for
identification. Leave to amend as per the draft granted. Amendment to be carried out
forthwith.
2. Heard Mr.Khambata. The reason for moving without notice is given in
paragraph-22 of the petition.
3. Petitioner is a company manufacturing steel and its allied products and claims to
be one of the largest in the business of manufacturing steel and its allied products in
India. Respondent nos.1, 2 & 3 are sister concerns of each other engaged in the
business of dealing in iron and steel products in all districts in the State of
Maharashtra. Petitioner appointed respondents as franchise to set up and operate a
JSW SHOPPEE for promoting and selling exclusively certain products of petitioner.
Petitioner entered into franchise agreement on 1.7.2018 with respondent no.1 as also
its sister concerns respondent nos.2 & 3. Clause 7.2.1 of the agreement is the
arbitration clause.
4. Clause-12 of the agreement deals with right of lien of petitioner and it provides that
although the risk in the products passes to the Franchisee from the date of dispatch
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/46251996/ 3Jsw Steel Ltd vs Delta Iron And Steel Co.Pvt.Ltd. And 2 ... on 22 October, 2019
of the products to the carrier and delivery being taken by the Franchisee, the title to
the products shall pass to the Franchisee only upon receipt of invoice amount by the
Franchisor. Clause-12 also provides that Franchisor shall have lien on the products so
delivered to the extent of unpaid purchase price of products and the Franchisor shall
be entitled to exercise the lien to recover the unpaid purchase price by taking back
the products and shall be entitled to sell the same to some other dealer and adjust
This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 5
nmcdl 2044-19.odt the sum so realized against the unpaid purchase price.
5. Petitioner has been supplying products from time to time and according to
petitioner as on 14.8.2019 there is an outstanding of about Rs.19 crores. Petitioner
gave a notice demanding payment on 14.8.2019 and respondents replied admitting
about Rs.9 crores. Mr.Khambata states that set off of claim by respondents is
incorrect but at the same time, admittedly over Rs.9 crores is payable.
6. In view of what is stated in paragraph-22 read with paragraph- 25 of the petition
and in view of the admission of respondents to the tune of at least Rs.9 crores, I am
satisfied that there is a prima facie case for ex-parte ad-interim injunction made out.
7. Therefore, ad-interim order in terms of prayer clauses-(k) and (l) is granted and
the same read as under :-
"(k) order and direct that pending the hearing and final disposal of the Arbitral
proceedings and for a period of 12 weeks thereafter, the Respondents be restrained
themselves and though its officers and/or its directors and/or its subordinates
and/or its servants and/or agents from in any manner whatsoever taking any steps to
dispose of the said Materials belonging to the Petitioner and in the possession of the
Respondent at least to the extent of the amounts due and payable to the petitioner,
including the Principal Amounts and Interest thereon as set out in the Particulars of
Claim at Exhibit H hereto ;
(l) order and direct that the Court Receiver be appointed and/or such other fit and
proper person be appointed as Receiver with all the powers under Order XL, Rule 1 of
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 to inter alia take stock and custody of the said
Materials belonging to the Petitioner and in the Respondents' possession, whether
stored at the latter's warehouses or otherwise wherever situate."
8. The Court Receiver High Court, Bombay shall keep the impugned goods under his seal in the safe
custody of respondents. Court Receiver is authorized to seek police assistance if required and police
authorities of concerned police station shall render all possible help to the Court Receiver including
deployment of such number of police personnel as required on production of an authenticated copy
of this order. The Court Receiver to do the needful and submit a report to this court by 7.9.2019.

9. The Advocates for petitioner will lodge an authenticated copy of this order with the office of the
Court Receiver within two days of an authenticated copy being made available. Upon an
authenticated This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 6
nmcdl 2044-19.odt copy being lodged with the Court Receiver, compliance with Rule 596 of the
Bombay High Court (O.S) Rules is dispensed with.
10. This order is not to be uploaded until the execution of this order by the Court Receiver.
11. Time to comply with the provisions of Order XXXIX Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
is extended for a period of one week from such time as the Court Receiver implements this order.
12. This order will operate till 16.9.2019. Liberty to respondents for variation of this order with 24
hours prior notice to petitioner is granted.
13. All parties including the Court Receiver are directed to act on an ordinary copy of this order, duly
authenticated by the Associate of this Court.
Stand over to 13.09.2019."
4. The applicant has moved this Notice of Motion being aggrieved by the sealing action taken by the
Court Receiver, against the applicant's goods, in pursuance of the aforesaid order passed by this
Court. The applicant interalia contends that some goods in respect of which Court Receiver has been
appointed by this Court and which were lying in the premises of the cutters/ warehouses are actually
goods sold to the applicant by the respondents and the petitioner cannot have any claim against
these goods. It is the applicant's case that there was no privity of contract, whatsoever between the
petitioner and the applicant. The applicant contends that having purchased the goods and having
paid the price for the same to the respondents, there was no question of the petitioner claiming any
rights on these goods. It is contended that the applicant is a bonafide purchaser of the goods for
value without This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 7
nmcdl 2044-19.odt notice of the contract between the petitioner and the respondents. Accordingly,
the present Notice of Motion has been filed by the applicant praying for the following reliefs:
a) That this Hon'ble Court be pleased to pass necessary orders and/or directions
directing the learned Court Receiver, High Court, Bombay to forthwith
release/de-seal the goods of the applicant/Non-party respondent as described in
Exhibit "A" hereto and handover possession thereof back to the applicant/non-party
respondent;
b) That this Hon'ble Court be pleased to pass necessary orders and/or directions
vacating the order dated 23 August 2019 to the extent of the goods of the
applicant/non party respondent as described in Exhibit "A" hereto;
c) For interim and ad-interim in terms of prayer clauses (a) and (b) above be granted;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/46251996/ 5Jsw Steel Ltd vs Delta Iron And Steel Co.Pvt.Ltd. And 2 ... on 22 October, 2019
d) for such other and further reliefs as this Hon'ble Court deems fit and proper under
the circumstances of the case."
5. The record would indicate that the grievance of the petitioner is in respect of the goods sold by the
petitioner to the respondents in respect of which, according to the petitioner, the
price/consideration has not paid to the petitioner by the respondents as per the terms and
conditions of contract (franchise agreement), the details of which are set out in Exhibit B to the
Arbitration Petition. It is the petitioner's case that under the contract as entered between the
petitioner with the respondents, the petitioner would have a lien on these goods which were sold to
the respondents for unpaid price of the goods. The petitioner contends that, hence, this Court (K.R.
Shriram, J.) taking a prima facie view of the matter by an ex-parte ad-interim This Order is
modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 8 nmcdl 2044-19.odt order
dated 23 August 2019 (supra) appointed the Court Receiver of this Court as the Receiver of the said
goods, who has taken physical possession of the goods.
6. At the hearing of this Notice of Motion, on the earlier occasion, the applicant made a grievance
that there were certain goods belonging to the applicant for which the Court Receiver was appointed
by this Court which were not included in the list at Exhibit B to the Arbitration Petition. On this Mr.
Kamdar, learned senior counsel for the petitioner had fairly agreed that if there were goods which
are not part of Exhibit B, then the petitioner' s would not have any objection for those goods being
deleted from the purview of the order passed by this Court on 23 August 2019. This Court
accordingly on 18 September 2019 passed the following order:
"1. Mr.Kamdar, learned Counsel for the petitioner-JSW Steel Ltd., on instructions of
Mr.Amit Murjani, Deputy Manager, Legal, and Mr. Bijoy Jose, Senior Manager,
Sales, authorised representative of the petitioner,makes a statement that his client
would not have any objection for the goods/coils which are not part of 'Exhibit B' to
the petition, to be released in favour of the applicant by the Court Receiver.
Statement is accepted.
2. The learned Court Receiver, High Court, Bombay is accordingly directed to take
appropriate steps and release the goods/coils in favour of the applicant before the
adjourned date of hearing. To the above effect, the order dated 23 August 2019
passed by this Court (K.R.Shriram, J.) stands modified.
3. Let this notice of motion be placed for hearing on 23 September 2019 at 3 p.m.
when an endeavour of the Court is to hear the parties on the remaining disputes and
pass final orders on the notice of motion.
4. Mr.Kamdar has made the above statement without prejudice to This Order is
modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 9 nmcdl
2044-19.odt therights and contentions of the petitioner that an amount of Rs.20
crores is due and payable by respondent nos.1 to 3 to the petitioner which is disputed
by Mr.Vashi who appears for respondent Nos.1 to 3.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/46251996/ 6Jsw Steel Ltd vs Delta Iron And Steel Co.Pvt.Ltd. And 2 ... on 22 October, 2019
5. Mr.Kamdar also states that his clients do not admit that the applicant-Vanit Gupta,
has become the owner of the goods.
6. Court Receiver shall undertake the exercise of release of the goods in presence of
the representatives of the parties.
7. The parties shall exchange the list of the goods/coils to be released which be
furnished to the learned Court Receiver to release the goods.
8. Court Receiver has submitted a report dated 18 September 2019 which is stated to
be a Site Report. It shall form part of the record. Copies of the said report be made
available to the parties."
7. Consequently, about 66 coils/goods were released in favour of the applicant and this came to be
recorded by further order of this Court dated 23 September 2019 which reads thus:
"1. Stand over to 26 September 2019 at 3.00 p.m.
2. Mr. Madon, learned senior counsel for the applicant has made statement that in
pursuance of the earlier orders, and discussion which has taken place, about 66 coils
are released in favour of the applicant. The adjudication therefore would confine to
the balance coils which Mr. Madon would state are about 60. The parties would be
heard on all the issues on the adjourned date of hearing.
3. Ad-interim orders passed earlier, shall continue to operate till the adjourned date
of hearing subject to the modification by the earlier orders.
4. All contentions of the parties are expressly kept open."
8. Now the question is of about 60 number of coils which still remain in custody of the Court
Receiver, on which the applicant is making a claim to This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking
to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 10 nmcdl 2044-19.odt contend that these are the goods
bonafide purchased by the applicant from the respondent for valuable consideration and thus there
is no justification in appointing the Court Receiver qua these goods which are legally sold to the
applicant by the respondents.
9. The case of the applicant is that the applicant is in the business of buying, selling, importing and
exporting steel and allied products since about 35 years as a sole proprietor in the name of Sri
Enterprises and is one of the reputed and oldest business houses in the trade of steel. The
applicant's group is known as "LK Group".
10. The applicant had travelled out of Mumbai on 23 August 2019 when on 24 August 2019, the
applicant received a phone call from Mr. Kirit Doshi of Deep Steels informing that the Court
Receiver along with police assistance had visited the cutters/warehouses at Taloja and were sealing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/46251996/ 7Jsw Steel Ltd vs Delta Iron And Steel Co.Pvt.Ltd. And 2 ... on 22 October, 2019
the goods of the applicant. The applicant along with his son immediately rushed to the
cutters/warehouses where Mr. Govind and others of the Court Receiver were present, who informed
the applicant that they were acting in pursuance of the order dated 23 August 2019 passed by this
Court. The applicant on going through the order pointed out to the representative of the Court
Receiver, that the goods which were being sealed did not belong to the petitioner and/or of This
Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 11 nmcdl 2044-19.odt
the respondents and were not in possession of the respondents. The applicant informed that he is
the owner and in possession of the goods and that the order of the Court pertains only to the goods
belonging to the petitioner and in possession of the respondents. Nonetheless the goods were sealed
by the Court Receiver. The Court Receiver has wrongly sealed the goods belonging to the applicant.
The applicant has contended that he was introduced to one Mr. Dhanesh Mehta of respondent no. 1
around 3 years back by a steel broker named Mr. Mahinder Beriwal and since then the applicant has
been regularly dealing with them. It is the applicant's case that the applicant in his normal
day-to-day business purchased from the respondents these goods (HR coils). The applicant is a
bonafide purchaser of the wrongly sealed goods and is in no manner connected with the disputes
inter-se between the petitioner and the respondents. The applicant has contended that the applicant
has paid the entire consideration in connection with the wrongly sealed goods either by RTGS,
Letter of Credits, Debit Notes/ Credit Notes and/ or against sale. It is contended that some of the
goods which are sealed are purchased by the applicant almost a year back. The applicant has
annexed at Exhibit A to the Notice of Motion a list setting out the names of cutters/warehouses and
the details of the goods purchased which are wrongly sealed by the Court Receiver. It is stated that
this list clearly mentions coil numbers, one of the petitioner and other of the cutters/ This Order is
modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 12 nmcdl 2044-19.odt
warehouses. The list also bears the signature and rubber stamp of the concerned cutters/warehouse.
11. The applicant has contended that the normal business method as followed between the applicant
and respondents was that the applicant used to telephonically place orders with the respondents
(vendors) for purchase of these goods. These goods are big sheets of steel rolled into a huge coil. In
the day-to-day functioning and working of the business, the HR coil rolls are directly sent by the
sellers, namely, by respondent no. 1 and respondent no. 3 to the cutters/warehouse. For this
purpose, respondent nos. 1 and 3, at the first instance, used to issue a coil transfer letter (an
intimation). The transfer letter as per the day to day business practice is always addressed to the
cutter/warehouse, the details of the goods to be transferred in favour of the applicant. The applicant
used to confirm the same with cutter/warehouse about the receipt of the said coil transfer letter.
Respondent nos. 1 and 3 thereafter used to raise their tax invoice in favour of the petitioner's
concern which mentions CGST and SGST. Thereafter the entire amount of the invoice including the
tax amounts were paid by the applicant to respondent no. 1 and/or 3 as the case may be. The
applicant's case is that the applicant has filed up-to-date CGST and SGST returns with the
authorities and all taxes in connection with the invoices are paid up-to-date.
This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 13 nmcdl

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/46251996/ 8Jsw Steel Ltd vs Delta Iron And Steel Co.Pvt.Ltd. And 2 ... on 22 October, 2019
12. The applicant contends that the method of business was that the applicant used to give
instructions to the cutter/warehouse either to cut the HR coils in particular sizes or sometimes the
applicant used to in turn sell the said HR coils directly to other buyers. In that case, identical
procedure was followed and the applicant used to issue a coil transfer letter. The coils thereafter
were either directly collected or continued to be warehoused by the buyers at the concerned
cutters/warehouses. In respect of these goods which are sealed and as per the applicant wrongly, for
the release of which, this Notice of Motion has been filed, respondent no. 1 and/or 3 have issued coil
transfer letters as also invoices were in respect of these goods. The applicant had paid the entire
amounts to respondent no. 1 due and payable under these invoices. The applicant contends that the
applicant is thus the owner of the said goods as also in possession of these goods.
13. The applicant further contends that the applicant also has a credit arrangement with Union Bank
of India, Mid-Corporate Branch, Nariman Point, Mumbai, wherein the monthly stock holding of the
applicant at the cutters/warehouses of the goods belonging to the applicant are liened or
hypothecated and a charge is created in favour of Union Bank of India as per the terms and
conditions of the credit facility sanctioned of a particular amount. The applicant has accordingly
contended that the goods which are This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order
dated 05/11/2019 14 nmcdl 2044-19.odt sealed by the Court Receiver belong to the applicant and
the same are hypothecated in favour of the Union Bank of India, as the applicant has borrowed
funds against these hypothecated goods which need to be repaid to the bankers for which the
applicant was also forwarding monthly statement of the goods to Union Bank of India
14. The applicant has relied on number of documents to indicate that the applicant is the owner and
in possession of the goods namely tax invoice, coil transfer letters, ledger account in the normal day
to day course of business indicating payment of amounts to respondent no.1 and/or respondent
no.3. The applicant has also contended that when the Court Receiver went to seal the goods, the
cutter/warehouse informed the Court Receiver that the goods do not belong to respondent no.1
and/or respondent no.3 and that the goods belong to the applicant. It is thus contended that neither
the petitioner nor respondent nos.1 and 3 have ownership rights over the goods which are sealed, as
they solely belong to the applicant, nor the petitioner or the respondents have any lien on the goods
which are sealed by the Court Receiver. The existing lien prior to the sealing was of the Union Bank
of India as the goods were hypothecated at the behest of the applicant to the said bank. It is thus
necessary that an ex-parte order dated 23 August 2019 passed by this Court needs to be set aside to
the extent it concerns the goods This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order
dated 05/11/2019 15 nmcdl 2044-19.odt belonging to the applicant. It is contended that the
applicant is suffering huge loss apart from a trauma and loss of reputation when the applicant is the
bonafide purchaser of the goods. The applicant is in no manner aware and concerned about the
disputes between the petitioner and the respondents, being absolutely a third party. The applicant
has borrowed funds against the hypothecated goods from Union Bank of India which need to be
paid back to the bankers. Thus, if the order is continued and the reliefs as prayed for is not granted,
huge monetary loss would be suffered by the applicant without any fault. It is further contended that
the Steel Industry is also going in a recession and the rates of steel are falling day by day and if the
order of sealing being continued, it would not permit the applicant to sell the goods which would
lead to a situation wherein the rates would have fallen and the applicant would have suffered huge
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/46251996/ 9Jsw Steel Ltd vs Delta Iron And Steel Co.Pvt.Ltd. And 2 ... on 22 October, 2019
losses. It is submitted that this would also bring about a situation that the applicant would be
declared as NPA if there is default in making payment to its bankers.
15. There is a reply affidavit filed on behalf of the petitioner of Mr.Bijoy Jose interalia contending
that for several reasons the documents which are relied upon by the applicant are not reliable. It is
contended that there is absence of petitioner's coil codes on the purported invoices raised by
respondent nos.1 and 3 as in the ordinary practice the petitioner assigns This Order is
modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 16 nmcdl 2044-19.odt
individual codes to each of its H.R. coils which serves to identify such coil. It is contended that the
alleged invoices, however, do not mention the petitioner's / manufacturer's given coil codes and
thus it is not possible to ascertain from a mere perusal of the invoices whether the goods which are
sold by the respondents to the applicant, were in fact the petitioner's goods. It is contended that
there are also inconsistencies between the invoices and coil transfer slips. It is contended that the
applicant cannot claim ownership on the handwritten list of the goods sealed by the Court Receiver,
in the absence of substantive evidence. It is contended that the said list also cannot be relied on to
establish any relationship between the applicant and the warehouse/cutters. It is contended that in
the ordinary course of business, the cutters/warehouses deal with traders like the respondents
and/or the applicant alone, the petitioner, a manufacturer, does not maintain direct contact with
them as cutters receive a majority of their business from such traders who have strong professional
ties with such traders. It is in these circumstances, the physical verification of the goods is
incumbent before such veracity can be attached to said lists purported prepared by the cutters. It is
contended that there is apparent inconsistencies in Exhibit "A" and "B" relied on behalf of the
applicant. There are also inconsistencies in the 'statement of paid Stock position' which do not refer
to stock which are stored with cutter/ warehouse and the same discrepancies as set out in paragraph
11 of the This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 17 nmcdl
2044-19.odt affidavit. It is further contended that the applicant has admitted that some of the stock
is unpaid which is contended on the basis of the stock statement, as also in regard to the said unpaid
stock the location has not been disclosed. The petitioner also contends that the applicant has
referred to several purported sales to respondent no.3. It is the petitioner's contention that from the
ledger as annexed by the applicant, it appears that the applicant is re- selling the goods to
respondent no.3 that what it has allegedly purchased from respondent no.1 and that no proper and
necessary documentation has been provided to substantiate the nature and genuineness of these
sales given that respondent nos.1 and 3 are sister concerns. It is contended that the applicant in
respect of certain goods has either issued a corresponding letter of credit which has not become due
or has wholly failed to pay in respect of the same. It is thus contended that it is unclear whether the
applicant is in fact the owner of the corresponding goods. It is thus contended that it is not possible
to ascertain the veracity of the applicant's claims that some of its goods are wrongly sealed and are
required to be de-sealed. It is thus contended that these circumstances necessitate reconciliation
and physical re-verification of the goods by a Court Commissioner or preferably a forensic audit
expert together the parties, including inspection of underlying documents in relation to the same.

16. There are two additional affidavits filed on behalf of the petitioner namely of Mr.Manish
Sharma, Manager, Sales and another affidavit of Mr.Bijoy Jose, both dated 3 September 2019. The
affidavits are quite similar. The contention in these affidavits is that one Mr.Rajaram Gurav who is
an employee of respondent no.1-Delta Iron and Steel Co.Pvt.Ltd. is in fact acting as a sales agent for
the applicant, and certain information in that regard including 'Whats app' messages are placed on
record to contend that for many years Mr.Rajaram Gurav was known to be a person working with
respondent no.1. The tenor of the affidavits is that internally respondent nos.1 and 3 are not
different.
17. The applicant has filed a rejoinder affidavit denying the allegations as made in the affidavits
dated 3 September 2019 of Mr.Manish Sharma and Mr.Bijoy Jose, to contend that the petitioner has
come with a false and bogus case. It is reiterated that the applicant is a bonafide owner and in
possession of wrongly sealed goods in respect of which the prayers are made in the notice of motion.
It is stated that the Court Receiver was informed about the same and despite which the goods were
wrongly sealed. It is contended that the petitioner is attempting to go into trivial negligible issues
and were attempting the hair-spitting all the documents in order to create complications and
confusion. It is contended that there is nothing wrong in This Order is modified/corrected by
Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 19 nmcdl 2044-19.odt the 'whats app' messages as
relied on by Mr.Manish Sharma and Mr.Bijoy Jose as Mr.Rajaram Gurav was in the service of the
applicant since 19 August 2019 and therefore, was entitled to issue such messages. Mr.Rajaram
would be justified in responding, if he receives messages from the prospective purchasers.
18. There is also a rejoinder affidavit dated 9 September 2019 of the applicant to the reply affidavit
filed on behalf of the petitioner denying the case of the petitioner. The applicant contends that the
Court Receiver was directed only to take possession of the goods belonging to the petitioner and in
possession of the respondents, however, the Court Receiver has exceeded its jurisdiction and the
directions of this Court in the order dated 23 August 2019, as the Court Receiver wrongly sealed the
goods the details of which are set out in the Notice of Motion which were not belonging to the
petitioner and were not in possession of the respondents as the applicant is the owner of these
goods. It is contended that the petitioner has deliberately not dealt with the statements in the
affidavit in support, thus the contention of the applicant is deemed to be admitted by the petitioner.
19. It is contended that the applicant in any case has made out a case for de-sealing of these wrongly
sealed goods. The applicant in its rejoinder to the This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to
Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 20 nmcdl 2044-19.odt various reply affidavits has set out the
market practice as how the goods reached the warehouse and how the code numbers are assigned.
In regard to the discrepancies as pointed out on behalf of the petitioner in regard to the weight and
name of Paramshakti Steel Ltd., it is stated that in regard to the stock of the applicant's goods at
Paramshakti Steel Limited the name as also the weight is mentioned. It is stated that in fact this is a
classic case of the petitioner trying to mislead the Court. It is stated that the unpaid stocks are in
connection with the round bars and not HR coils and the Chartered Accountant has already certified
the ledger account in that regard.

20. There is also a reply affidavit to the notice of motion filed on behalf of respondent no.1 of
Mr.Akshay Jain- Director of respondent no.1 who confirms that respondent no.1 has sold the goods
sealed by the Court Receiver to the applicant for valuable consideration. It is further contended that
the money received from the applicant were paid over to the petitioner by making ad- hoc payments.
It is stated that there is nothing wrong in the market practice that the steel which is purchased by
the applicant as per the market requirement is re-purchased by respondent no.1 and this indicates
the trading which happens in the steel market and it depends on the understanding of the market. It
is submitted that these are usual market practices and there is nothing dishonest about a well
accepted trade practice in the market. It is This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes
Order dated 05/11/2019 21 nmcdl 2044-19.odt contended that the petitioner has deliberately tried
to twist the facts. In paragraph 8 of the affidavit, it is contended that the applicant had purchased
the HR coils/goods from the respondents and have paid the entire consideration by RTGS, Letters of
Credit, cheques and/or against sale, which is then paid by respondent nos.1 and 3 to the petitioner
from time to time. Respondent no.1 confirms the details as set out by the applicant in respect of such
concluded sale such as number of invoices, names of cutters, details of warehouses etc. at a chart
which is annexed at "Exhibit A" to the affidavit in support of the notice of motion. Respondent no.1
has also contended that after selling the material in question to the applicant, the respondents have
paid GST and have filed GST returns with the concerned authorities. In regard to the discrepancies
in the Code numbers, respondent no.1 has contended that it is complete distortion of facts by the
petitioner as it is contended that code numbers given by the petitioner on each HR coils runs into 10
digits or more. It is stated that invariably the respondents, the applicant, cutters, etc. have to deal
large quantity of HR coils and hundreds of coils every day and it is not practical to refer to the 10
digits or more code number given by the petitioner, and therefore, as a well established market
practice, on receiving the HR Coils from the petitioner, the respondents would paint their own code
numbers on HR coils. It is stated that after the applicant purchases the same HR coils from the
respondents, the delivery will be taken This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes
Order dated 05/11/2019 22 nmcdl 2044-19.odt by the applicant and the applicant will keep the HR
coils in the godown of the cutters and the cutters write down or paint their own code number on the
HR coils. It is thus contended that when the petitioner deals with the respondents, the same will be
in terms of the coil code number given by the petitioner, and similarly when the respondents deal
with the applicant or any other buyer, the respondents will deal with the coil code number given by
the respondents and/or cutter coil number and when the applicant deals with his customers, the
applicant would use the cutter's code number. It is for this reason in each invoice raised by the
petitioner on the respondents, invoice raised by the respondents on the applicant and letter issued
by the cutters if perused, the chain from the petitioner's godown to the cutter's godown can easily be
established. It is stated that the deponents of the affidavit are aware about the market practice but
have suppressed the same from this Court.
21. There is another affidavit of Mr.Rajiv Bakshi dated 12 September 2019 filed on behalf of the
petitioner stated to be affidavit in rejoinder to respondent no.1 and respondent no.3's affidavit. The
petitioner interalia contends that respondent nos.1 and 3 are operating hand in gloves with the
applicant. The petitioner has denied the contentions as urged on behalf of respondent no.1 on all
counts, including the contention on the trade practice, on the applicant being the owner of the said
goods etc., which need not be This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated

22. On the above pleadings, the learned senior counsel for the parties have made their respective
submissions.
23. Mr. Madon, learned senior counsel for the applicant has drawn my attention to various
documents placed on record, namely, invoices, delivery notes, proof of payment of GST returns.
Referring to the pleadings, Mr. Madon would contend that indisputedly the applicant is the owner of
the goods having paid the full consideration amount to respondent nos. 1 and/or 3 and considering
the clear position in law, the petitioner would not have any right whatsoever once the physical
possession of the goods was with the applicant. Mr. Madon has contended that the petitioner is
asserting its rights on the goods on presumption that they belong to respondent nos. 1 and 3 under
the Franchise Agreement dated 1 July 2018 and more particularly on the basis of Clause 12, namely,
"Right of lien" as agreed between the petitioner and respondents. Mr. Madon has contended that
this agreement itself is doubtful for the petitioner to assert any right in as much as the agreement is
stated to be of 1 July 2018 while on the stamp paper it is dated 14 September 2018 and a copy, as
placed on record, is also not signed on behalf of the petitioner as also the names of two witnesses of
the petitioner is This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019
24 nmcdl 2044-19.odt kept blank.
24. Mr. Madon referring to the provisions of Section 19(2) of the Sale of Goods Act would contend
that the petitioner cannot claim any lien on the goods which were sold by the respondents to the
applicant and bonafide purchased by the applicant. Mr.Madon would submit that even assuming
that there is a lien on these goods in favour of the petitioner, there is waiver of lien on the part of
petitioner. Mr. Madon referring to Clause 2.1.7 of the Franchise Agreement would contend that even
if it is assumed that the respondent is not the owner of the goods, however, by virtue of section 27 of
the Sale of Goods Act, the petitioner cannot exercise any right of lien. Mr. Madon would next
contend that the contention of the petitioner that the petitioner had a lien on these goods is also
contrary to the provisions of Sections 30(2), 46 and 49 of the Sale of Goods Act when admittedly the
petitioner had parted with the possession of the goods. It is contended that these provisions clearly
recognize the applicant's rights in respect of the said goods. In support of his contention, Mr. Madon
has placed reliance on the decision of the Single Judge of this Court in JRY Investments Private Ltd.
vs. Deccan Leafine Services Ltd. & Ors.,1 and the decision of the Division Bench of the Delhi High
Court in Delhi International Airport P. Ltd. vs. Union of 1 2003 SCC Online Bom 1134 This Order is

Ors.2
25. Mr.Vashi, learned senior counsel for respondent nos.1 and 3 has made the following
submissions:-
(i) It is submitted that there is suppression of MOU dated 19 July 2018 which was
entered between the petitioner and respondent no.1 for the period 2018-2019, which
was to remain valid for one year from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019. It is his
contention that once this agreement had expired the petitioner would not have
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/46251996/ 13Jsw Steel Ltd vs Delta Iron And Steel Co.Pvt.Ltd. And 2 ... on 22 October, 2019
contended that there is any sale made after the expiry of this agreement and there
can be any unpaid price for the said goods.
(ii) It is submitted that this MOU has been suppressed by the petitioner in obtaining
the ex-parte ad-interim orders. It is contended that for the year 2019-2020 a fresh
memorandum of understanding dated 9 May 2019 was signed whereunder
respondent no.1 had agreed to purchase various steel products quantity of which is
786 metric tonns. It is contended that both these MOUs do not have any arbitration
agreement and thus the petition itself is not maintainable.
(iii) The purchases undertaken under the MOU dated 9 May 2019 also 2 2017 SCC
Online Del 7021 This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order
dated 05/11/2019
26 nmcdl 2044-19.odt cannot be the subject matter of the present proceedings in the absence of any
arbitration agreement. Mr.Vashi would refer to the reply affidavit as filed to the petition of
Mr.Akshay Jain dated 7 September 2019 to contend that the Franchise agreement dated 1 July 2018
is executed on a stamp paper dated 14 September 2018 and stated by the petitioner to be executed
on 22 September 2018. It is submitted that even the signatures on behalf of the petitioner are not
existing on the copy which is annexed to the petition and therefore, all these considerations are
imperative for the Court to disbelieve this document and consider granting any discretionary reliefs.
It is his contention that the franchise agreement is not acted upon inasmuch as as provided in
Clause 2.1.1 an amount of Rs.10 lakhs was never paid by respondent no.1 to the
petitioner/franchiser. Mr.Vashi would accordingly submit that there is no case made out for grant of
any ad-interim relief. In support of his contention Mr.Vashi has relied upon the decision of the
Supreme Court in S.P.Chengalvaraya Naidu (Dead) By Lrs vs. Jagannath (Dead) by Lrs & Ors.3, to
contend that the ex-parte order is obtained by the petitioner by playing fraud on the Court and by
suppressing the documents and therefore, would not be entitled to any relief.
26. Mr.Kamdar, learned senior Counsel for the petitioner in support of the ex-parte order passed by
this Court and opposing the notice of motion filed by 3 (1994)1 SCC 1 This Order is
modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 27 nmcdl 2044-19.odt the
applicants, has made the following submissions:-
(i) It is submitted that there is no suppression of any of the relevant documents. It is
submitted that the franchise agreement was acted upon which is clear from the fact
that respondent no.1 had opened a JSW Shopee as per the franchise agreement which
is not disputed by respondent no.1. It is submitted that by the memorandum of
understanding dated 19 July 2018 the financial year 2018-19 is not relevant as the
MOU pertains to an incentive which is being offered by the petitioner to the
respondents, as clear from the various clauses of the MOU. It is submitted that the
sales are actually being undertaken under the franchise agreement and the incentives
and additional incentives are governed by the MOU for the financial year 2018-19 as
also there was a subsequent MOU for the period 2019-2020.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/46251996/ 14Jsw Steel Ltd vs Delta Iron And Steel Co.Pvt.Ltd. And 2 ... on 22 October, 2019
(ii) Referring to various clauses of the MOU's, it is stated that it is totally
misconceived and untenable for the respondents to contend that the MOUs are
relevant or there is suppression of MOUs, as they are irrelevant in so far as the
amounts which are due and payable by respondent nos. 1 and 3 to the petitioner,
under the sales which had taken place under the franchise agreement.
(iii) Mr.Kamdar has referred to the franchise agreement and various clauses This
Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019
28 nmcdl 2044-19.odt therein, to contend that the petitioner has a lien on the goods as agreed
between the parties in Clause 12 thereof, on goods which are sold under the franchise agreement
and for recovery of price of the said goods.
(iv) It is submitted that right of lien is required to be recognized under the Sale of goods Act as also
under the provisions of the Contract Act. In this regard Mr.Kamdar would refer to the provisions of
Section 13, 14, 19, 25 and 62 of the Sale of Goods Act as also the provisions of Section 171 of the
Indian Contract Act.
(v) It is thus contended that the petitioner's claim is under the franchise agreement under which the
petitioner has a lien on the goods. Mr.Kamdar would submit that the contention as urged on behalf
of the applicant that there is waiver of the lien, is untenable. It is his submission that lien would
continue to exist under the franchise agreement, and not only when the goods are sold but till the
purchasers make payment of the price. Mr.Kamdar has contended that there cannot be a question of
any waiver of right by the petitioner till the price is paid, as the right to recover the price would
accrue only after the goods are sold and till the goods are sold, the right remains a prospective right
to sale the goods. It is his contention that only when the goods are sold, the new right to recover
amounts would accrue. In support of This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes
Order dated 05/11/2019 29 nmcdl 2044-19.odt his contention Mr.Kamadar has placed reliance on
the decision of the Supreme Court in Sikkim Subba Associates Vs. State of Sikkim4.
(vi) It is contended that respondent nos.1 and 3 had no right to sell the goods till the price of the
goods was paid by the respondents to the petitioner, and this becomes relevant considering the
provisions of Section 25 of the Sale of Goods Act which would restrict the right of respondent no.1 to
sell the goods and further Clause 12.1 under which the petitioner and respondents have agreed on
the petitioner's lien on the goods.
(vii) Mr.Kamdar referring to the provisions of Section 62 of the Sale of Goods Act would contend
that it recognizes the right to lien contrary to Section 47. He has accordingly made submissions
referring to the provisions of Section 19, 25 and 62 of the Sale of Goods Act, as to what would be the
purport of the provisions as applicable to the facts of the present case.
(viii) It is submitted that it is open to a party to make a contract differently. This principle is well
recognized as can be seen from the decision of the Supreme Court in Contship Container Lines Ltd.
Vs. D.K.Lall & Ors.5. It is thus his submission that the contract is accordingly required to be

629 5 (2010)4 SCC 256 This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated
05/11/2019 30 nmcdl 2044-19.odt suggested by him. It is his submission that if this position is
recognized then the provisions of Section 47 and 49 are not applicable.
(ix) Mr.Kamdar submits that the applicant cannot contend that he is a bonafide purchaser without
notice. It is contended that Mr.Rajaram Gurav who is acting on behalf of the applicant is deemed to
have knowledge of the franchise agreement. It is thus contended that respondent nos.1, 2 and 3 have
inter se transactions and they are in fact one entity and have adopted this modus operandi to create
third party rights with an intention to defeat the rights of the petitioner so as to deprive the
petitioner of the amounts due and payable to it for sale of the goods. In this context Mr.Kamdar has
referred to the pleadings on record and more particularly affidavit of Mr.Bijoy Jose. It is contended
that the petitioner has fairly permitted release of those goods which were not part of 'Exhibit B'. It is
submitted that there is no manner of doubt and there is clear admission of liability as seen from the
messages as exchanged between the representative of respondent no.1 and that of the petitioner.
(x) Mr.Kamdar in support of his submission relies on the decisions in Arunima Baruah Vs. Union of
India & Ors. 6; MRF Ltd. Vs. Manohar Parrikar & 6 (2007)6 SCC 120 This Order is
modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 31 nmcdl 2044-19.odt Ors.7;

27. Mr.Madon, learned senior Counsel for the applicant in rejoinder would submit that the
contention as urged on behalf of the petitioner on the non waiver of the rights of the petitioner,
cannot be accepted. In this context he has referred to the provisions of Sections 14 and 27 of the Sale
of Goods Act. It is next submitted that the petitioner has no reply to the documents as placed on
record on behalf of the applicant that the goods are purchased as also GST amounts are paid which
would show that these are bonfide transactions. It is submitted that the applicant has no concern
whatsoever either with the petitioner or the respondents except for the transactions which are
entered into and for which consideration was paid by the applicant to the respondents to purchase
the goods in question. Mr.Madon would accordingly submits that none of the contentions as urged
on behalf of the petitioner and on behalf of respondent no.1 can affect the legal rights of the
applicant to the goods which are lawfully purchased by the applicant. 7 (2010)11 SCC 374 8

32 nmcdl 2044-19.odt Reasons and Conclusion
28. Having heard the learned senior counsel for the parties and having perused the record, the
question which arises for determination in this Notice of Motion is as to whether the applicant who
is a third party to the dispute between the petitioner and respondent no. 1 would be entitled to the
release of the goods as claimed, which are sealed by the Court Receiver in pursuance of the exparte
order dated 23 August 2019 passed by this Court. The adjudication of this motion would involve
consideration of the inter se rights between the petitioner and the respondents, on one hand, under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/46251996/ 16Jsw Steel Ltd vs Delta Iron And Steel Co.Pvt.Ltd. And 2 ... on 22 October, 2019
the franchise agreement and on the other hand, rights of the applicant who state to have
independently purchased the goods from the respondents.
29. Some relevant facts are required to be noted. Although the respondents pointing out
discrepancies on the document of the Franchise Agreement dated 1 July 2018, entered between the
petitioner and the respondents, it appears from record that the said agreement was acted upon. This
for the reason that it is not in dispute that the respondents have purchased the goods from the
petitioner during the relevant period and the respondent no. 1 also established a "JSW Shoppe". It
also appears that though this Franchise Agreement was entered on 1 July 2018 but it was executed
on 22 September 2018 on stamp paper dated 14 September 2018. This Order is modified/corrected
by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 33 nmcdl 2044-19.odt The term of the agreement is
for a period of 5 years from the date of execution as provided in Clause 1.2 of Franchise Agreement.
Further a duly executed document by the respondent is also produced for perusal of the Court. In
my opinion these discrepancies would not matter in view of a duly executed agreement being
available and when the said agreement was acted upon. It also appears that the petitioner has
entered into a Memorandum of Understanding dated 19 July 2018 with the respondents for the F.Y.
2018-19 which was for a period from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019 and a subsequent MOU for the
year 2019-20 was arrived at on 9 May 2019 for a total MOU quantity of 78000 metric tons (MT).
From the perusal of the conditions in these MOUs it is clear that these are in the nature of incentives
which are offered by the petitioner on the sales which would take place under the Franchise
Agreement.
30. The arbitration agreement between the parties is contained in the Franchise Agreement as
provided for in Clause no. 7.2 and 7.2.1. As the sale of goods between the petitioner and respondents
had taken place under the Franchise Agreement, it cannot be accepted that this petition under
section 9 is not maintainable, as there is clearly an arbitration agreement between the parties. It also
appears that the MOU may not be of relevance when the actual sale transaction are required to be
considered. The contention as This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated
05/11/2019 34 nmcdl 2044-19.odt urged by Mr. Vashi, learned senior counsel for respondent nos. 1
and 3 that the non-disclosure of the MOU is required to be considered as a material suppression, in
my opinion, cannot be accepted considering the non-relevancy of the MOU. Mr. Vashi's contention
that the dispute is required to be seen only in the context of MOU which has no arbitration
agreement, also cannot be accepted to non-suit the petitioner. In my opinion, prima facie, there is
sufficient material to indicate that the Franchise Agreement was acted upon between the petitioner
and respondents and the sales were undertaken under the Franchise Agreement, the validity of
which was for a period of 5 years w.e.f. 22 September 2018. Thus, in my opinion, though it is well
settled that suppression would defeat the entitlement to any discretionary relief as seen from the
decision as cited by Mr. Vashi, in the facts of the present case, the principle as laid down in the said
decision would not be applicable, as the MOU's are not that relevant, so that by non-disclosure of
the same the petitioner is deriving any unfair benefit or advantage to itself, to the prejudice of the
respondents.
31. In the context of the reliefs as prayed by the applicant, some clauses of the Franchise Agreement
are required to be noted as also referred by the learned senior counsel for the parties. These clauses

13. SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS 13.1 Provisions under Clause 2.1.7 (Confidentiality), Clause 4A
(Indemnity), Clause 6.1(Communication and Notices), Clause 7.1 (Settlement and Disputes), Clause
7.2 (Arbitration), 7.3 (Governing Law), Clause 12 (Right of Lien) and such other provisions which by
their nature would survive shall survive termination of this Agreement."
32. The claim of the petitioner against the respondents as seen from the averments as made in the
arbitration petition is in respect of goods sold by the petitioner to the respondents, the details of
which are set out in Exhibit to the arbitration petition. Perusal of Exhibit B are the sale transactions
as stated by the petitioner to have taken place from 28 April 2019 to 21 June 2019. It has also
transpired that during the pendency of this Motion, certain goods which were sealed by the Court
receiver and which were not part of Exhibit B, already stand released in favour of the applicant and
the applicant is now making a claim for about 60 HR coils which are part of Exhibit B and This
Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 38 nmcdl 2044-19.odt
which according to the applicant are sold by the respondents to the applicant. The applicant
contends that in respect of these 60 HR coils, the petitioner cannot have any claim. By this gesture,
the petitioner has recognized that there were valid sales by the respondents in favour of the
applicant qua these goods which were now being separated and/or agreed to be released by the
petitioner on their description not being available in Exhibit B to the petitioner. What is material is
that the position of the goods which were agreed to be released by the petitioner and the goods
which have continued to remain sealed, is not different, as both the sets of goods are purchased by
the applicant under similar and/or identical documents. Merely because some of these goods did
not form part of the list at Exhibit B to the petition, the petitioner agreed to release the same,
whereas some still continue to remain sealed, although purchased under valid and similar
documents. Mr. Madon would accordingly contend that the petitioner cannot dispute the sale
transactions in all these goods which are similar in nature and which are conclusive between the
respondents and the applicant.
33. As seen from the submissions as noted above, Mr. Madon, learned senior counsel for the
applicant has contended that the applicant has independent rights once these goods are sold to the
applicant by the respondents and nothing contained in the Franchise Agreement can affect the This
Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 39 nmcdl 2044-19.odt
rights of the applicant, who is a bonafide purchaser for value without any notice of the agreement
entered between the petitioner and the respondents (Franchise Agreement). The basis on this
contention is that these are valid purchase transactions for which finance was raised by the
applicant from Union Bank of India and that full amount/consideration is paid qua these purchases
to the respondents, as also the tax (GST) is paid and GST returns are also filed. Mr. Madon's
submission is that the applicant has an unimpeachable right in law over these goods, as claimed and
entitlement to these goods.
34. Per contra, Mr. Kamdar as noted above has submitted that considering the terms and conditions
of the Franchise Agreement, the applicant cannot claim any absolute rights in respect of these goods
and the rights of the petitioner to recover the unpaid price of the goods is required to be recognized
considering the provisions of Franchise Agreement and the relevant provisions as would be
applicable under the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 read with the provisions of the Indian Contract Act,

35. Thus the question is whether the applicant would be entitled to the release of goods as claimed,
which are sealed by the Court receiver
36. It would be necessary to note the relevant provisions of the Sale of Goods Act as also referred on
behalf of the parties. Section 14 of the Sale of This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to
Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 40 nmcdl 2044-19.odt Goods Act provides for implied undertaking
as to the title, in case of Sale and Agreement to sell as also the implied warranty of quiet possession
of the goods by the buyer and of the goods to be free from any charge or encumbrances in favour of
the third party, not declared or known to the buyer before or at the time when the contract is made.
Section 19 provides that when there is contract of sale of ascertained goods, the property in them is
transferred to the buyer at such time as the parties to the contract intend it to be transferred and to
ascertain the intention of the parties, regard shall be had to the terms of the contract, the conduct of
the parties and the circumstances of the case. Section 25 pertains to reservation of right of disposal
by the seller until certain terms are fulfilled. Section 27 provides for sale by a person who is not the
owner and provides that the buyer acquires no better title to the goods than the seller had, unless
the owner of the goods by his conduct precluded from denying the seller's authority to sell. Section
30 provides for a seller or buyer in possession of the goods after sale. In the present context,
sub-section (2) provides that where a person, having bought or agreed to buy goods, obtains, with
the consent of the seller, possession of the goods or the documents of title to the goods, the delivery
or transfer of the goods by that person, to any person receiving the same in good faith and without
notice of any lien or other right of the original seller in respect of the goods, shall have the effect, as
if such lien or right did not exist. Section 45 This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to
Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 41 nmcdl 2044-19.odt defines as to when a seller can be a "Unpaid
Seller". Section 46 provides for right of the unpaid seller. Section 47 provides for the unpaid seller's
lien who is in possession of the goods and his entitlement to retain possession of them until
payment or tender of the price is made as provided in sub-section 1(a) to (c). Sub-section (2) of
Section 47 provides for sellers right to exercise lien notwithstanding that he is in possession of the
goods as an agent or bailee for the buyer. Section 49 provides as to when an unpaid seller of goods
loses his lien thereof and accordingly, termination of lien of the unpaid sellers as set out in
sub-section (1)(a) to (c) and sub-section (2). Section 62 provides for exclusion of implied terms and
conditions under a contract of sale and provides that where any right, duty or liability would arise
under a contract of sale by implication of law, it may be negatived or varied by express agreement or
by the course of dealing between the parties or by usage, if the usage is such as to bind both parties
to the contract. There is some argument advanced also on the provisions of Section 171 of the
Contract Act on behalf of the petitioner.
37. For convenience, it would be desirable to note these provisions as the arguments as made on
behalf of the parties revolve around the legal position as would emerge on the applicability of these
provisions and the law in that regard. These provisions read thus:-

14. Implied undertaking as to title, etc. In a contract of sale, unless the circumstances
of the contract are such as to show a different intention, there is --
(a) an implied condition on the part of the seller that, in the case of a sale, he has a
right to sell the goods and that, in the case of an agreement to sell, he will have a right
to sell the goods at the time when the property is to pass;
(b) an implied warranty that the buyer shall have and enjoy quiet possession of the
goods;
(c) an implied warranty that the goods shall be free from any charge or encumbrance
in favour of any third party not declared or known to the buyer before or at the time
when the contract is made.
19. Property passes when intended to pass. --
(1) Where there is a contract for the sale of specific or ascertained goods the property in them is
transferred to the buyer at such time as the parties to the contract intend it to he transferred. (2) For
the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the parties regard shall be had to the terms of the
contract, the conduct of the parties and the circumstances of the case.
(3) Unless a different intention appears, the rules contained in sections 20 to 24 are rules for
ascertaining the intention of the parties as to the time at which the property in the goods is to pass
to the buyer.
25. Reservation of right of disposal. --
(1) Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods or where goods are subsequently
appropriated to the contract, the seller may, by the terms of the contract or appropriation, reserve
the right of disposal of the goods until certain conditions are fulfilled. In such case, notwithstanding
the delivery of the goods to a buyer or to a carrier or other bailee for the purpose of transmission to
the buyer, the property in the goods does not pass to the buyer until the conditions imposed by the
seller are fulfilled.
(2) Where goods are shipped or delivered to a railway administration for carriage by railway and by
the bill of lading or railway receipt, as the case may be, the goods are deliverable to the order of the
seller or his agent, the seller is prima facie deemed to reserve the right of disposal.
(3) Where the seller of goods draws on the buyer for the price and transmits to the buyer the bill of
exchange together with the bill of lading or, as the case may be, the railway receipt, to secure This

Explanation. -- In this section, the expressions "railway" and "railway administration" shall have the
meanings respectively assigned to them under the Indian Railways Act, 1890 (9 of 1890).
27. Sale by person not the owner.-
Subject to the provisions of this Act and of any other law for the time being in force, where goods are
sold by a person who is not the owner thereof and who does not sell them under the authority or
with the consent of the owner, the buyer acquires no better title to the goods than the seller had,
unless the owner of the goods is by conduct precluded from denying the seller's authority to sell.
Provided that, where a mercantile agent is, with the consent of the owner, in possession of the goods
or of a document of title to the goods, any sale made by him, when acting in the ordinary course of
business of a mercantile agent, shall be as valid as if he were expressly authorised by the owner of
the goods to make the same, provided that the buyer act is good faith and has not at the time of the
contract of sale notice that the seller has not authority to sell.
30. Seller or buyer in possession after sale.-
(1) Where a person, having sold goods, continues or is in possession of the goods or of the
documents of title to the goods, the delivery or transfer by that person or by a mercantile agent
acting for him of the gods or documents of title under any sale, pledge o other disposition thereof to
any person receiving the same in good faith and without notice of the previous sale shall have the
same effect as if the person making the delivery to transfer were expressly authorised by the owner
of the gods to make the same. (2) Where a person, having bought or agreed to buy goods, obtains
with the consent of the seller, possession of the goods or the documents of title to the goods, the
delivery or transfer by that person or by a mercantile agent acting for him, of the goods or
documents of tile under any sale, pledge or other disposition thereof to any person receiving the
same in good faith and without notice of any lien or other right of the original seller in respect of the
gods shall have effect as if such lien or right did not exist. RIGHTS OF UNPAID SELLER AGAINST
THE GOODS
45. "Unpaid seller" defined.--
This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 44 nmcdl
2044-19.odt (1) The seller of goods is deemed to be an "unpaid seller" within the meaning of this
Act--
(a) when the whole of the price has not been paid or tendered;
(b) when a bill of exchange or other negotiable instrument has been received as conditional
payment, and the condition on which it was received has not been fulfilled by reason of the
dishonour of the instrument or otherwise.
(2) In this Chapter, the term "seller" includes any person who is in the position of a seller, as, for
instance, an agent of the seller to whom the bill of lading has been endorsed, or a consignor or agent
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/46251996/ 23Jsw Steel Ltd vs Delta Iron And Steel Co.Pvt.Ltd. And 2 ... on 22 October, 2019
who has himself paid, or is directly responsible for, the price.
46. Unpaid seller's rights.--
(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act and of any law for the time being in force, notwithstanding
that the property in the goods may have passed to the buyer, the unpaid seller of goods, as such, has
by implication of law--
(a) a lien on the goods for the price while he is in possession of them;
(b) in case of the insolvency of the buyer a right of stopping the goods in transit after he has parted
with the possession of them;
(c) a right of re-sale as limited by this Act.
(2) Where the property in goods has not passed to the buyer, the unpaid seller has, in addition to his
other remedies, a right of withholding delivery similar to and co-extensive with his rights of lien and
stoppage in transit where the property has passed to the buyer.
Unpaid seller's lien
47. Seller's lien.--
(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the unpaid seller of goods who is in possession of them is
entitled to retain possession of them until payment or tender of the price in the following cases,
namely:--
(a) where the goods have been sold without any stipulation as to credit;
(b) where the goods have been sold on credit, but the term of credit has expired;
(c) where the buyer becomes insolvent.
(2) The seller may exercise his right of lien notwithstanding that he is in possession of

This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 45 nmcdl
2044-19.odt
49. Termination of lien.--
(1) The unpaid seller of goods loses his lien thereon--
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/46251996/ 24Jsw Steel Ltd vs Delta Iron And Steel Co.Pvt.Ltd. And 2 ... on 22 October, 2019
(a) when he delivers the goods to a carrier or other bailee for the purpose of transmission to the
buyer without reserving the right of disposal of the goods;
(b) when the buyer or his agent lawfully obtains possession of the goods;
(c) by waiver thereof.
(2) The unpaid seller of goods, having a lien thereon, does not lose his lien by reason only that he
has obtained a decree for the price of the goods.
62. Exclusion of implied terms and conditions.--
Where any right, duty or liability would arise under a contract of sale by implication of law, it may
be negatived or varied by express agreement or by the course of dealing between the parties, or by
usage, if the usage is such as to bind both parties to the contract." THE INDIAN CONTRACT ACT,
1872 "171. General lien of bankers, factors, wharfingers, attorneys and policy-brokers-
Bankers, factors, wharfingers, attorneys of a High Court and policy- brokers may, in the absence of a
contract to the contrary, retain, as a security for a general balance of account, any goods bailed to
them; but no other persons have a right to retain, as a security for such balance, goods bailed to
them, unless there is an express contract to that effect."
38. Having noted the contractual provisions as also the relevant provisions of the Sale of Goods Act,
at the outset it needs to be emphasised that here is a case where the seller-petitioner did not retain
the possession of the goods. If this be so then the question for consideration is whether nonetheless
any lien of the petitioner under Clause 12 of the contract can be said to exist. This Order is
modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 46 nmcdl 2044-19.odt
39. Section 47 of the Act is clearly provides that the lien of an unpaid seller of the goods, who is in
possession of these goods, would be to retain possession until payment or tender of the price as
provided for in sub-clauses
(a), (b) and (c) or sub-section (2) of Section 47. In the present case even this statutory lien cannot be
recognized as the petitioner has parted with the possession of the goods by making delivery of the
goods to the respondents.
40. The legal position which would emerge is that once the goods having been delivered to the
respondents and even assuming that the price/consideration had remain unpaid, the consequence
as postulated by Section 49 of the Sale of Goods Act takes effect, namely that the petitioner- unpaid
seller of goods, would lose its lien once the delivery of goods is effected to the respondents. More
particularly when there is nothing on record to indicate that the petitioner had reserved its rights of
disposal of the goods by the respondents/buyers. By delivery of possession, there is also an
automatic consequence which would take place in terms of Section 49 of the Sale of Goods Act,
namely that once these goods are delivered to the respondents, it would amount to petitioner
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/46251996/ 25Jsw Steel Ltd vs Delta Iron And Steel Co.Pvt.Ltd. And 2 ... on 22 October, 2019
waiving its rights under Clause 12 and its sub-clauses under the franchise agreement.
41. The above discussion is although on the principal contract between the This Order is
modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 47 nmcdl 2044-19.odt
petitioner and the respondents. However, in regard to the rights of the applicant in the notice of
motion is concerned, the argument of Mr.Madon, is of the applicant being a bonafide purchaser of
the goods without notice of such lien. Mr.Madon has contended that even assuming if any such lien
of the petitioner existed, the same cannot be recognized and is of no legal effect in the facts of the
case, in regard to the sale of the goods by the responents as made to the applicant. This inasmuch as
the franchise agreement itself prohibits the respondents to disclose any information to any third
party. Clause 2.1.7 of the franchise agreement as noted above created an obligation on the
respondents/ franchisee to keep the provisions of the agreement and all information concerning the
franchiser, confidential and no information could have been disclosed without the written
permission of the petitioner. There is much substance in these contentions of Mr. Madon. There is
no material on record to indicate that the applicant was at any point of time aware, much less in a
manner known to law, of the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement and more particularly
the right of lien. Apart from the fact that the applicant was not aware of any right of lien existing in
favour of the petitioner, which in fact is none however by the very clause in the agreement, the
applicant was not supposed to know any rights in respect of the goods which are purchased by the
applicant from the respondents, for which valuable consideration was parted and accounted for and
even taxes This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 48
nmcdl 2044-19.odt paid thereon.
42. Even Section 25 of Sale of Goods Act which provides for reservation of the right of disposal of
goods cannot come to the aid of the petitioner. On a holistic consideration of the facts and
circumstances and the documents on record, in my opinion, it cannot be accepted that the petitioner
reserved any right of disposal of the goods at the hands of the buyer (respondents) as per Clause 12
of the Franchise Agreement. The Court cannot be oblivious to the trade practices and commercial
intention of the parties as placed on record in extenso. On the basis of these very trade practices and
invoices and other documents, the petitioner itself agreed to release 66 of the sealed goods.
43. In the peculiar facts of the case, the petitioner intended that the purchaser of the goods from the
respondent would be prevented from having any knowledge of the franchise agreement and that
such purchaser would remain totally unconnected with the contractual arrangement under the
Franchise Agreement entered between the petitioner and the respondent. Moreover, proviso to
Section 27 will recognize such a sale in favour of the applicant in the ordinary course of business.
Also this is a case where the petitioner has not demonstrated any fraud on the part of the applicant.

44. Mr. Madon , learned senior counsel for the applicant would be correct in relying on the decision
of learned Single Judge of this Court in JRY Investments Pvt. Ltd.(supra) to support his argument of
the applicant being a bonafide purchaser without notice. In this case, the Court considering the
provisions of Section 27 of the Sale of Goods Act and taking a review of the law, made the following
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/46251996/ 26Jsw Steel Ltd vs Delta Iron And Steel Co.Pvt.Ltd. And 2 ... on 22 October, 2019
observations in paragraphs 36 to 41 of the judgment:
36. Mr. Tulzapurkar, learned counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the sale of the
shares by defendant No. 1 was not a sale by the owner of the shares. It is not possible
to accept the contention of Mr. Tulzapurkar, learned counsel for the plaintiffs that the
plaintiffs not having conveyed any title in the shares to defendant No. 1, the
purchasers from defendant No. 1 acquired no better title to the goods than the seller
as provided by Section 27 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. As observed earlier, the
plaintiffs did not create a pledge and indeed transferred title in the shares to
defendant No. 1. Therefore, it cannot be said that the sale by defendant No. 1 of the
shares is sale by a person who is not an owner thereof.
37. Assuming for the sake of argument that the plaintiffs did not convey title in the
shares to defendant No. 1, it does not ipso facto lead to the conclusion that
defendants Nos. 18, 14 and 35 who purchased shares from defendant No. 1 could not
get any title in the shares. There are certain exception to the rules that no person can
pass a better title to another than he himself possesses. The law acknowledges cases
when a person having no title to the property may acquire and pass good title to a
bona fide purchaser for a value without any knowledge or by virtue of any defect in
the title of the person conveying the same. The Calcutta High Court has set out these
classes of cases in Smt. Sumitra Debi Jalan v. Satya Narayan Prahladka, , wherein the
Calcutta High Court observed in paragraph 47 as follows (page 362):
"47. In this case it has been clearly established on evidence that title to shares such as
the shares in suit passes from hand to hand freely by delivery with blank transfer
deeds duly signed by the registered holders. There is evidence also that the
purchasers could not have found out if there were any defect in title to these shares at
the time of purchase and thus in my opinion these shares are negotiable according to
the law merchant, custom and/or practice of the Calcutta Stock This Order is
modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 50 nmcdl
2044-19.odt Exchange. No doubt under the Sale of Goods Act 'shares' are goods but
that do not preclude them from being negotiable according to custom, practice or the
law merchant."
38. The Calcutta High Court has further observed in paragraphs 48 and 49 as follows (page 362) :
"48. There may arise cases also when the true owner may be estopped from asserting
his title against a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of any defect in title
although from whom such bona fide purchaser acquires such title has no title to pass
: Section 27 of the Sale of Goods Act.
49. The principle of bona fide purchaser for value without notice acquiring a good
title although the person conveying the same had no title had further been extended
and recognised on the ground of mercantile convenience."

39. In the present case, it is clear that the other defendants had no reason to suspect that there was
any defect in title of defendant No. 1 particularly since the shares stood in the name of defendant
No. 1 as beneficial owner upon transfer by the plaintiffs. These circumstances of the shares standing
in the name of defendant No. 1 as beneficial owner of the shares in the records of the depository
participant was clearly attributed to the act of plaintiff in transferring the shares instead of creating
a pledge in accordance with the Depositories Act. The other defendants obviously had no notice of
any defect in title of defendant No. 1, assuming there was, and they must therefore be taken to be
bona fide purchasers without notice. Therefore, it would be appropriate in the interest of justice to
hold, assuming that defendant No. 1 did not get title to the shares that the true owner, i.e., the
plaintiffs must be taken to be estopped from asserting its title against bona fide purchasers for value
without notice of any defect in the title. This situation is certainly brought about by the conduct of
the plaintiffs who had transferred the shares and not created a pledge. It must be noted that the
plaintiffs have pleaded that they have been defrauded by defendant No. 1 in that defendant No. 1 has
obtained the shares and has not advanced the loan to the plaintiffs. Since the plaintiffs admit that
they did not write any letter demanding a loan as contemplated by Clause 24 of the loan agreement,
it is difficult to see any case of fraud on the part of defendant No. 1. As observed earlier, defendant
No. 1 claims to be ready and willing to disburse the loan and in any case the correspondence
between the plaintiffs and the defendants does not contain a whisper that defendant No. 1 has
committed a fraud. Even in This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated
05/11/2019 51 nmcdl 2044-19.odt the case of fraud, the Supreme Court has made the following
observations in regard to the status of innocent purchasers in Central National Bank Ltd. v. United
Industrial Bank Ltd., . In paragraph 10, the Supreme Court observed as under (page 184) :
"If an innocent purchaser or pledgee obtains goods from the person in possession
thereof, whose possessory right is defeasible on the ground of fraud but had not
actually been defeated at the time when the transaction took place, there is no reason
why the rights of such innocent purchaser or pledgee should not be protected. The
right in the possessor or bailee in such circumstances is determinable no doubt but so
long as it is not determined it is sufficient to enable him to create title in favour of an
innocent transferee for value without notice. This proposition is well recognised in
English law and seems to us to be well founded on principle. In Cahn v. Pockett's
Bristol Channel Steam Packet Co. [1899] 1 QB 643 (CA) at page 659(A) Collins LJ,
made the following oft quoted observation :
'However fraudulent a person in actual custody may have been, in obtaining the
possession, provided it does not amount to larceny by trick and however grossly he
may abuse confidence reposed in him, or violate the mandate under which he got
possession, he can, by his disposition, give a good title to the purchaser.'"
40. Their Lordships have observed that the position would be different if the fraud committed is of
such a character as would prevent there being consent at all on the part of the owner to give
possession of the goods to a particular person such as a case where A obtains possession of goods
from the owner by falsely representing himself to be B. Such is clearly not a case here.

41. In an early case, this court in Fazal D. Allana v. Mangaldas M. Pakvasa, AIR 1922 Bom 303, 311,
this court observed as follows :
"Where a seller is induced to perform his part of a valid contract of sale and to deliver
the goods to the buyer in performance of that contract by fraud or cheating on the
part of the buyer, the property in the goods delivered to the buyer passes to the buyer,
and if the buyer sells and delivers the goods to a bona fide purchaser for valuable
consideration without notice, such a purchaser gets a good title to the goods and the
seller cannot recover the goods from such a purchaser."

45. It is significant to refer to the provisions of Section 30 and the consequences which in full force
are applicable to the facts of the case. Sub- section (2) of Section 30 clearly provides for a situation
in which the applicant in the present case would stand, namely the applicant, being a person who
has brought these goods with the consent of the seller (respondents) and is in possession of the
goods or the documents of title to the goods and receiving the same in good faith without any notice
of any lien or other right of the original seller qua the goods. It would be thus deemed that by virtue
of sub-section (2) of Section 30 such a lien of the original seller (petitioner) did not exist.
46. In my opinion, the sale of the goods in question in favour of the applicant by the respondent, as
the facts stand would have a legal sanctity also considering the provisions of Section 62 of the Sale of
Goods Act which recognises any right, duty or liability arising under a contract of sale by implication
of law, which can be negatived or varied either by express agreement or by course of dealing
between the parties or by usage.
47. The case as pleaded by the petitioner if accepted is likely to create a chaos, as in that event, the
Court would be discarding the established trade practice culminating into conclusive sale of goods in
favour of third parties This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated
05/11/2019 53 nmcdl 2044-19.odt like the applicant, who had paid full price for the goods, and
cause an irreparable injury and damage to such a purchaser. Hence to accept the argument of Mr.
Kamdar to continue to detain the goods of the applicant would lead to disastrous commercial
consequences for the applicant and add to the prejudice already caused due to the sealing of the
goods. It also appears from the record that the petitioner in relation to the agreement in question
even in the past had not recognized any embargo on the respondents rights to sell the goods to third
parties, which appears to be a usual trade practice.
48. I am afraid that the provisions of Section 171 can be made applicable in the facts of the case, to
deny the applicant his lawful entitlement to the goods delivered to the applicant in the normal
course of business by the respondent. The decision of the Supreme Court in Board of Trustees of the
Port of Bombay & Ors. vs. Sriyanesh Knitters 13 in my opinion is clearly not applicable in the facts of
the case. Moreover, the entire complexion of applicability of the provisions of Section 171 of the
Contract Act changes when the goods of the unpaid seller are bonafide purchased by third party like

the applicant and such rights in favour of a bonafide purchaser being clearly recognized by
sub-section (2) of Section 30 of the Sale of Goods Act 13 (1999) 7 SCC 359 This Order is
modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 54 nmcdl 2044-19.odt read
with the provisions of Section 47 and 49 of the Sale of Goods Act, which clearly provides that unpaid
seller of goods loses his lien when he delivers the goods to a carrier or other bailee for the purpose of
transmission to the buyer without reserving the right of disposal of the goods or when the buyer or
his agent lawfully obtains possession of the goods or by waiver thereof.
49. The decision in Suchetan Exports Pvt. Ltd. (supra) was a case of a High Seas sale agreement. The
Court held that determination of lien over goods for which part of sale consideration has been paid
would depend upon the terms of agreement and in the facts of the case. It was held that delivery of
goods to stevedore cannot be held to mean that the title and ownership of the goods passed over to
the buyer and that the lien over the goods stood terminated. It is in this context, the Court made
observation in paragraph 19 that the "terms of the High Seas sales agreement appear to indicate that
till the entire sale price was paid by the petitioner to respondent no. 1, and respondent no. 1 would
retain its lien over the coal in question and title would also pass to the petitioner on payment of the
full price of the goods".
50. Even the decision in Rasiklal Kantilal and Company vs. Board of Trustee of Port of Bombay &
Ors.14, would not be applicable to the facts of the case where the question was whether the issue was
on a claim to demurrage 14 (2017) 11 SCC 1 This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to
Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 55 nmcdl 2044-19.odt charges for the period anterior to the
appellant's acquisition to the title of the goods and whether the appellant was entitled to remission
of the amount towards demurrage. It is in this context, the Court has made observations as
contained in paragraph 58, observing as to what Section 171 would mean in recognizing the right of
lien of the categories of persons as recognized by the said provision.
51. Mr. Madon would also be correct in referring to the decision of Division Bench of Delhi High in
Delhi International Airport P. Ltd. (supra) to contend as to what would be the position of the person
dealing with a franchise even assuming that such a person who is a third party is aware about the
Franchise Agreement. The Court in paragraph 58 of the said decision had observed as under:
58. A representational right would mean that a right is available with the franchisee
to represent the franchisor. When the Franchisee represents the franchisor, for all
practical purposes, the franchisee loses its individual identity and would be know by
the identity of the franchisor. The individual identity of the franchisee is subsumed in
the identity of the franchisor. In the case of a franchise, anyone dealing with the
franchisee would get an impression as if he were dealing with the franchisor."
52. There are some decisions cited on behalf of the parties, which I do not intend to discuss, as the
propositions as canvassed by these decisions are well settled, however, the same are not only
applicable to the facts of the case and a reference to the same would be wholly academic in view of
my above This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 56
nmcdl 2044-19.odt observations.

53. Having considered the record and the position in law, I am convinced to hold that the case of the
applicant that the goods as claimed by the applicant to be bonafide purchased by them, being
wrongfully sealed is required to be accepted. In my opinion, the petitioner has attempted to create a
confusion by referring to some discrepancies in coil numbers etc. However, on prima facie
consideration of the documents of title to the goods coupled with other documents of delivery, GST
payment etc. as pointed out on behalf of the applicant and respondent no. 1, would clearly indicate
that not only the respondents but also the warehouse keepers and cutters have recognized the
ownership of these goods to be of applicant. Even otherwise the material as relied upon by Mr.
Kamdar learned senior counsel for the petitioner to contend that the sealed goods as claimed by the
applicant belonged to the petitioner is substantially vague and weak. The contention of Mr. Kamdar
in merely pointing out discrepancies in the coil numbers do not inspire any confidence to hold that
these goods as claimed by the applicant belong to the petitioner.
54. In the aforesaid circumstances, Notice of Motion filed by the applicant would require to be
allowed. It is accordingly allowed in terms of prayer This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking
to Minutes Order dated 05/11/2019 57 nmcdl 2044-19.odt clauses (a) & (b) which reads thus:
"a) That this Hon'ble Court be pleased to pass necessary orders and/or directions
directing the learned Court Receiver, High Court, Bombay to forthwith
release/de-seal the goods of the applicant/Non-party respondent as described in
Exhibit "A" hereto and handover possession thereof back to the applicant/non-party
respondent;
b) That this Hon'ble Court be pleased to pass necessary orders and/or directions
vacating the order dated 23 August 2019 to the extent of the goods of the
applicant/non party respondent as described in Exhibit "A" hereto;"
55. The Receiver who is present in the Court is directed to forthwith take further consequential steps
to give effect to this order.
56. Disposed of in the above terms. No costs.
57. At this stage learned Counsel for the Petitioner seeks stay of this Order. Mr. Madon learned
Counsel for the Applicant has vehemently opposed the prayer and has submitted that the Applicant
has already suffered substantial losses.
58. Having regard to the observations as made in the foregoing paragraphs, in my opinion, the
request for stay ought not to be accepted. It is accordingly rejected.
