Judgment? Yes

3. Whether the Judgment should be reported in the Digest? Yes
NEERAJ KISHAN KAUL, J. (ORAL)
1. The issue which arises for our consideration in the present appeal is whether the proceedings
before the Consumer Forum should remain stayed and await the decision of the outcome of the
proceedings involving similar issues pending before this High Court. The present appeal arises out
of the order dated 5th March, 2009 passed by the learned Single Judge. The appellant (original
petitioner in the writ petition) claimed a direction to set aside an order dated 6th November, 2007
passed by the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, in a complaint preferred by the
respondent No.1 (original respondent in the writ petition). The basis of the writ petition was that
substantially similar, if not identical issues are pending trial in this Court in Civil Suit No. 1700 of
2005 (Jatinder Kaur Wirk vs. Mitsubishi Motor Corporation and Ors). The respondent No. 1
claimed to have purchased a Mitsubishi Pajero, manufactured by the appellant. The vehicle met with
an accident while being driven by respondent No. 1(cid:128)s brother who sustained fatal injuries and died.
As per the respondent No. 1, the vehicle had manufacturing defects and on the ground of those and
other allegations, he claimed compensation. The wife of respondent No. 1(cid:128)s brother, Mrs. Jatinder
Wirk filed a suit before this Court, claiming inter alia, damages for negligence against the appellant.
2. As per the appellant, the issues which concern the respondent No. 1 are common to the suit
pending in this Court which was at an advanced stage. As per the appellant, continuation of both the
proceedings, would have a deritorious effect and could result in conflicting orders. As per the
appellant, despite this being pointed out, the State Commission had proceeded with the complaint
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1234412/ 1M/S Hindustan Motors Ltd. vs Amardeep Singh Wirk & Ors. on 14 May, 2009
and he contended that the impugned order of the State Commission recorded that merely because a
plea had been raised before the High Court alleging manufacturing defect, there would be no bar
against the owner of the car to seek release as prescribed under Section 14(1) of The Consumer
Protection Act, 1986 (hereinafter referred to as the â€žAct(cid:128)). As per the appellant, identical issues with
regard to alleged manufacturing defect of some parts of the said vehicle have been raised which
require a trial and in these circumstances, it would be appropriate that the authority under the
Consumer Protection Act should have stayed its proceedings in the interest of justice and awaited
the order and decree of the High Court as that would have been binding on the appellant.
3. The case of the respondent No. 1 in the writ petition was that the parties in the two proceedings
are different. The respondent No. 1 was asserting an alleged deficiency in the service, based on its
contractual relationship by having purchased the vehicle, whereas the plaintiff in the suit before this
Court had claimed damages on the basis of alleged tortuous liability of the appellant. Both being
independent causes of action and the parties claiming such reliefs being different, it was urged on
behalf of respondent No. 1 that there was no question of the State Commission having acted illegally
in refusing the appellant(cid:128)s request.
4. The learned Single Judge has rightly held that Section 3 of the Act cannot imply that the rights
created under the Act could be curtailed on the ground of pendency of other proceedings. It was also
correctly held relying on judgments of the Supreme Court, by the learned Single Judge that
existence of parallel or other adjudicatory Forums cannot take away or exclude jurisdiction created
under the Consumer Protection Act.
5. At this stage, it would be relevant to refer to some decisions of the Supreme Court. In the case of
Satpal Mohindra vs. Surindra Timber Stores, (1999) 5 SCC 696, the Hon(cid:128)ble Supreme Court in
para-5 has held as under:-
"5. After perusing the record, we find that whereas the appellant had filed the
complaint on 21-5-1994 seeking damages, the suit was filed by the respondent much
later in the civil court claiming the price of the material supplied by it. Under these
circumstances, the State Forum was not justified in dismissing the appeal filed by the
appellant without recording any finding on the merits of the appeal because the filing
of the suit by the respondent during the pendency of the proceedings before the
Consumer Forum for a different type of relief could not oust the jurisdiction of the
Consumer Forum. The order of the State Forum dated 14-10-1996 is completely
erroneous. It cannot be sustained. We, accordingly accept this appeal and set aside
the order of the State Forum dated 14-10-1996 as well as that of the National Forum
dated 21- 7-1998. We remand the appeal to the State Forum for its disposal on merits
in accordance with law. The State Forum shall dispose of the appeal expeditiously. No
costs."
6. In that case, the appellant had filed a complaint before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal
Forum, Ambala, alleging deficiency of service by use of sub-standard material by the respondent,
with whom an order had been placed by him for fabricating of doors and windows. The appellant
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1234412/ 2M/S Hindustan Motors Ltd. vs Amardeep Singh Wirk & Ors. on 14 May, 2009
sought suitable compensation from the respondent. The complaint of the appellant was dismissed
and the appellant took the matter in appeal to the State Consumer Forum. However, the State
Consumer Forum, without going into the merits of the appeal, non-suited the appellant on the
ground that the matter was subjudice before a Civil Court. As per the State Consumer Forum, the
appellant would have an opportunity to file a counter-claim there and that as the matter would be
decided on merits by the Civil Court, there was no scope for any further action in the Consumer
jurisdiction. The revision petition of the appellant before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission was also dismissed holding that the appellant could raise all the points before the Civil
Court in the pending suit. It was in this background that the appellant approached the Supreme
Court by way of a Special Leave Petition, wherein the above observations and findings were given by
the Supreme Court.
7. The Supreme Court in the case of Secretary, Thirumurugan Co-operative Agricultural Credit
Society vs. M. Lalitha & Ors. (2004) 1 SCC 305, held that having due regard to the scheme of the
Consumer Protection Act and the purpose sought to be achieved to protect the interest of the
consumers better, its provisions are to be interpreted broadly, positively and purposefully to give
meaning to additional/extended jurisdiction, particularly when Section 3 seeks to provide remedy
under the Act in addition to other remedies provided under other Acts unless there is a clear bar.
Some of the relevant findings of the Supreme Court in that matter are reproduced hereinbelow:-
"11. From the statement of objects and reasons and the scheme of 1986 Act, it is
apparent that the main objective of the Act is to provide for better protection of the
interest of the consumer and for that purpose to provide for better redressal,
mechanism through which cheaper, easier, expeditious and effective redressal is
made available to consumers. To serve the purpose of the Act, various quasi judicial
forums are set up at the district, State and National level with wide range of powers
vested in them. These quasi judicial forums, observing the principles of natural
justice, are empowered to give relief of a specific nature and to award, wherever
appropriate, compensation to the consumers and to impose penalties for non-
compliance of their orders.
12. As per Section 3 of the Act, as already stated above, the provisions of the Act shall
be in addition to and not in derogation to any other provisions of any other law for
the time being in force. Having due regard to the scheme of the Act and purpose
sought to be achieved to protect the interest of the consumers, better the provisions
are to be interpreted broadly, positively and purposefully in the context of the present
case to give meaning to additional/extended jurisdiction, particularly when Section 3
seeks to provide remedy under the Act in addition to other remedies provided under
other Acts unless there is clear bar.
13. The view we are taking is supported by the earlier decisions of this Court. In
Lucknow Development Authority v. M.K. Gupta, (1994) 1 SCC 243, this Court
observed, thus: -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1234412/ 3M/S Hindustan Motors Ltd. vs Amardeep Singh Wirk & Ors. on 14 May, 2009
"We therefore come straight away to the legal issue involved in these appeals. But
before doing so and examining the question of jurisdiction of the District Forum or
State or National Commission to entertain a complaint under the Act, it, appears,
appropriate to ascertain the purpose of the Act, the objective it seeks to achieve and
the nature of social purpose it seeks to promote as it shall facilitate in comprehending
the issue involved and assist in construing various provisions of the Act effectively.
To begin with the preamble of the Act, which can afford useful assistance to ascertain
the legislative intention, it was enacted, to provide for the protection of the interest of
consumers. Use of the word 'protection' furnishes key to the minds of makers of the
Act. Various definitions and provisions which elaborately attempt to achieve this
objective have to be construed in this light without departing from the settled view
that a preamble cannot control otherwise plain meaning of a provision. In fact the
law meets long felt necessity of protecting the common man from such wrongs for
which the remedy under ordinary law for various reasons has become illusory.
Various legislations and regulations permitting the State to intervene and protect
interest of the consumers have become a haven for unscrupulous ones as the
enforcement machinery either does not move or it moves ineffectively, inefficiently
and for reasons which are not necessary to be stated. The importance of the Act Ties
in promoting welfare of the society by enabling the consumer to participate directly
in the market economy. It attempts to remove the helplessness of a consumer which
he faces against powerful, business, described as, 'a network of rackets' or a society in
which, 'producers have secured power' to 'rop the rest' and the might of public bodies
which are degenerating into storehouses of inaction where papers do not move from
one desk to another as a matter of duty and responsibility but for extraneous
consideration leaving the common man helpless, bewildered and shocked. The
malady is becoming so rampant, widespread and deep that the society instead of
bothering, complaining and fighting against it, is accepting it as part of life. The
enactment in these unbelievable yet harsh realities appears to be a silver lining,
which may in course of time succeed in checking the rot."
14. In Fair Air Engineers Pvt. Ltd. And Anr. v. N.K. Modi, (1996) 6 SCC 385, this
Court, after referring to Lucknow Development Authority case (supra), held that the
provisions of the Act are to be construed widely to give effect to the object and
purpose of the Act. It went on to say that "It is seen that Section 3 envisages that the
provisions of the Act are in addition to and are not in derogation of any other law in
force. It is true, as rightly contended by Shri Suri, that the words "in derogation of the
provisions, of any other, law for the time being in force" would be given proper
meaning and effect and if the complaint is not stayed and the parties are not
relegated to the arbitration, the Act purports to operate in derogation of the
provisions of the Arbitration Act. Prima facie, the contention appears to be plausible
but on construction and conspectus of the, provisions of the Act we think that the
contention is not well founded. Parliament is aware of the provisions of the
Arbitration Act and the Contract Act, 1872 and the consequential remedy available
under Section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, i.e., to avail of right of civil action in a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1234412/ 4M/S Hindustan Motors Ltd. vs Amardeep Singh Wirk & Ors. on 14 May, 2009
competent court of civil jurisdiction. Nonetheless, the Act provides the additional
remedy." Further, dealing with the jurisdiction of the forums under the 1986 Act in
paragraph 16 this Court has stated, thus: -
"16. It would, therefore, be clear that the legislature intended to provide a remedy in
addition to the consentient arbitration which could be enforced under the Arbitration
Act or the civil action in a suit under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.
Thereby, as seen, Section 34 of the - Act does hot confer an automatic right nor create
an automatic embargo on the exercise of the power by the judicial authority under
the Act. It is a matter of discretion Considered from this perspective, we hold that
though the District Forum, State Commission and National Commission are judicial
authorities, for the purpose of Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, in view of the object
of the Act and by operation of Section 3 thereof, we are of the considered view that it
would he appropriate that, these forums created under the Act are at liberty to
proceed with the matters in accordance with the provisions of the Act rather than
relegating the parties to an arbitration proceedings pursuant to a contract entered
into between the parties. The reason is that the Act intends to relieve the consumers
of the cumbersome arbitration proceedings or civil action unless the forums on their
own and on the peculiar facts and circumstances of a particular case, come to the
conclusion that the appropriate forum for adjudication of the disputes would be
otherwise those given in the Act."

16. A Bench of three learned Judges of this Court in a recent decision in State of
Karnataka v. Vishwabharathi House Building Coop Society and Ors.
MANU/SC/0033/2003, expressed the view that the 1986 Act was brought into force
in view of the long-felt necessity of protecting the common man from wrongs where
for the ordinary law for all intent and purport had become illusory and that in terms
of the said Act, a consumer (sic) entitled to participate in the proceedings directly as a
result whereof his helplessness against a powerful business house may be taken care
of. Referring to the Fair Air Engineers (P) Ltd. Case (aforementioned), the Court
stated that the provisions of the said Act are required to be interpreted as broadly as
possible. On the question of jurisdiction it is stated that the forums under the Act
have jurisdiction to entertain a complaint despite the fact that other forums/courts
would also have jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the lis. It is also noticed that the Act
provides for a further safeguard to the effect that in the event a complaint involves
complicated issues requiring recording of evidence of experts, the complainant would
be at liberty to approach the civil court for appropriate relief."

8. In Secretary, Thirumurugan Co-operative Agricultural Credit Society vs. M. Lalitha
& Ors. (supra) case, the respondents being members of the appellant-society, had
pledged paddy bags for obtaining loan. The appellant-society had issued notices to
the respondents demanding payment of loan amount with interest thereon. The
respondents filed petitions in the District Consumer Forum, seeking direction to the
appellant to release the paddy bags pledged on receipt of the loan amount or in the
alternative to direct the appellant to pay the market values of the paddy bags with
interest thereon. The appellant contested the claims of the respondents before the
District Forum raising a preliminary objection that Consumer Forum had no
jurisdiction to decide the dispute between the members and cooperative society in
view of Section 90 of the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies Act, 1983. One of the
issues framed by the District Forum was whether it had jurisdiction to entertain the
complaints of this nature? The District Forum decided in favour of the respondents.
The appellant took the matter in appeal to the State Consumer Commission. The
State Commission allowed the appeal filed by the appellant and dismissed the appeal
filed by the respondents. The State Commission held that the complaints filed by the
respondents were themselves not maintainable having regard to Section 90 of the
Act. The respondents approached the National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission by way of a revision petition. The National Commission allowed the
revision petition and set aside the order of the State Commission. It would be
material to reproduce relevant provisions of the Tamilnadu Cooperative Societies Act,
1983, hereinbelow:-
"Section 90. Disputes - (1) If any dispute touching the constitution of the board or the
management or the business of a registered society (other than a dispute regarding
disciplinary action taken by the competent authority constituted under Sub-section
(3) of Section 75 or the Registrar or the Society or its board against a paid servant of
the society) arises -
(a) among members, past members and persons claiming through members, past
members and deceased members, or
(b) between a member, past member or person claiming through a member, past
member or deceased member and the society, its board or any officer, agent or
servant of the society, or
(c) between the society or its board and any past board, any officer, agent or servant,
or any past officer, past agent or past servant, or the nominee, heirs or legal
representatives of any deceased officer, deceased agent, or deceased servant of the
society, or
(d) between the society and any other registered society, such disputes shall be
rendered to the Registrar for decision.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1234412/ 6M/S Hindustan Motors Ltd. vs Amardeep Singh Wirk & Ors. on 14 May, 2009
Explanation - For the purpose of this section, a dispute shall include -
(i) a claim by a registered society for any debt or demand due to it from a member,
past member or the nominee, heir or legal representative of the deceased member
whether such debt or demand be admitted or not.
(ii) A claim by a registered society against a member, past member or the nominee,
heir or legal representative of a deceased member for the delivery of possession to the
society of land or other immovable property resumed by it for breach of the
conditions of assignment or allotment of such land or other immovable property, and
(iii) a decision by the board under Sub-section (3) of Section 34:
Provided that no dispute relating to, or in connection with, any election shall be
referred under this sub-section till the date of the declaration of the result of such
election."
Section 156 - "Bar of jurisdiction of civil courts
- Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force no
order or award passed, decision or action taken or direction issued under this Act by
an arbitrator, a liquidator, the Registrar or an officer authorized or empowered by
him, the Tribunal or the Government or any officer subordinate to them, shall be
liable to be called in question in any court and no injunction shall be granted by any
court in respect of anything which is done or intended to be done by or under this
Act."
9. The Supreme Court in Secretary, Thirumurugan Co-
operative Agricultural Credit Society vs. M. Lalitha & Ors. (supra) case upheld the decision of the
National Commission. The Supreme Court held that remedies that are available to an aggrieved
party under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 are wider. Though there was a special statute to deal
with the disputes between the parties, in that case, the Supreme Court held that merely because the
rights and liabilities were created between the members and the Management of the society under
the Tamilnadu Act and Forums were provided, it could not take away or exclude the jurisdiction
conferred on the Forums under the Consumer Protection Act, expressly and intentionally to serve a
definite cause in terms of the objects and reasons of the Act.
10. Further in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh, (2004) 5 SCC 65, the
Supreme Court observed that Consumer Protection Act, 1986, had a wide reach and the Commission
had jurisdiction even in cases of service rendered by statutory and public authorities. Such
authorities become liable to compensate for misfeasance in public office i.e. an act which is
oppressive or capricious or arbitrary or negligent provided loss or injury is suffered by a citizen. It
was held that it was open to the Commission to determine the amount for which the authority is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1234412/ 7M/S Hindustan Motors Ltd. vs Amardeep Singh Wirk & Ors. on 14 May, 2009
liable to compensate the consumer for his sufferance due to misfeasance in public office by the
officers.
11. Reliance was placed by the learned counsel for the appellant on a decision of the Hon(cid:128)ble
Supreme Court in India Household & Healthcare Ltd. vs. LG Household & Healthcare Ltd., (2007) 5
SCC 510. In that case, an application under Section 11 of the Act had been filed for appointing an
Arbitrator on the respondent(cid:128)s purported failure to do so despite a notice. The reliance was placed
on an arbitration clause contained in the agreement entered into between the parties. The
respondent, however, contended that the said agreement was preceded by a Memorandum of
Understanding and that the said purported Memorandum of Understanding and Licence Agreement
were vitiated by fraud. The respondents had also filed a suit in the Madras High Court, wherein the
Madras High Court by way of an interim injunction had restrained the appellant from directly or
indirectly acting on the so called Memorandum of Understanding and Licence Agreement. The
allegations in the said matter were of fraud and the very existence of the agreement containing the
arbitration clause. The Supreme Court took note of the fact that fraud vitiates all solemn acts and
observed in paragraph-16 as follows:-
"16. The said issue is pending consideration before the Madras High Court. Not only
the parties to the agreement but also those officers who have negotiated on behalf of
the respective companies are also parties therein. LG Corporation which is the owner
of the LG logo is also a party therein. Therein, an order of injunction had been
passed. In terms of the said order of injunction, the applicant herein was prohibited
from taking any action in terms of the said agreement which would include the
arbitration clause also. The order dated 21.01.2006 has become final. No appeal has
been preferred thereagainst. The applicant could have filed an appropriate
application for modification of the order of injunction which it did not choose to do.
The doctrine of comity or amity required a court not to pass and order which would
be in conflict with another order passed by a competent court of law. The courts have
jurisdiction to pass an order of injunction not only under Order XXXIX, Rule 2 of the
Code of Civil Procedure but also under Section 151 thereof."
12. The Supreme Court was of the view that the Court while exercising its judicial function would
ordinarily not pass an order which would make one of the parties to the lis violate a lawful order
passed by another court. The Supreme Court, accordingly, declined to entertain the application for
appointment of an Arbitrator at this stage. This decision of the Supreme Court in India Household &
Healthcare Ltd. vs. LG Household & Healthcare Ltd. (supra) case has no application to the facts of
the present case. Nowhere was the issue of ouster of the jurisdiction of the Consumer Forum while a
matter involving similar issue is pending in the Civil Court, considered. Moreover, the Supreme
Court declined to entertain the application under Section 11 of the Act as the very existence of an
arbitration agreement was under challenge in a separate proceedings where allegations of fraud had
been made and interim orders passed by the High Court. The said judgment is, thus, of no
assistance to the appellant. The appellants also placed reliance on the decision of the National
Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission in Dinesh Premji Shah vs. S.N. Pathak, II (2006) CPJ
200 (NC). All that was observed in the said case was that Consumer Forum cannot go against the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1234412/ 8M/S Hindustan Motors Ltd. vs Amardeep Singh Wirk & Ors. on 14 May, 2009
order passed by the Civil Court and that Consumer Protection Act, 1986 provides only an additional
remedy but does not confer jurisdiction on a Consumer Forum to act as an Appellate body or
exercise powers which do not emanate from the Act constituting it. This proposition is well settled.
However, it in no way advances the case of the appellant. Nor does it suggest that the proceedings in
the Consumer Forum must be stayed merely because the issues are substantially similar in
proceedings pending in a Civil Court.
13. The appellant also relied on an order of the Supreme Court in Proprietor, Jabalpur Tractors vs.
Sedmal Jainarain & Anr., 1995 Supp. (4) SCC 107. It is well settled that a judgment is good law for
the facts on which it is decided and an order or a judgment cannot be cited out of context. It is
evident from a bare perusal of the said short order passed by the Supreme Court in the matter that it
was an order made in the facts of the case and does not lay down any legal principle that where
proceedings are pending in a Civil Court involving similar issues, the Consumer Courts cannot
exercise their jurisdiction and entertain a validly instituted complaint under the Consumer
Protection Act.
14. As held by the Supreme Court in State of Orissa vs. Mohd. Illiyas, (2006) 1 SCC 275, a decision is
a precedent on its own facts. Each case presents its own features. It is not everything said by a judge
while giving judgment that constitutes a precedent. A decision is an authority for what it actually
decides. What is of the essence in a decision is its ratio and not every observation found therein, nor
what logically flows from the various observations made in the judgment. The enunciation of the
reason or principle on which a question before a court has been decided is alone binding as a
precedent. A case is a precedent and binding for what it explicitly decides and no more. It was also
observed by the Supreme Court in Rajbir Singh Dalal vs. Chaudhary Devi Lal University, Sirsa, 2008
(9) SCC 284, that a decision of a court is a precedent if it lays down some principle of law supported
by reasons. Mere casual observations or directions, without laying down any principle of law and
without giving reasons does not amount to a precedent. Further the Supreme Court in the case of
Union of India vs. Dhanwanti Devi, (1996) 6 SCC 44, held that it is not everything said by a Judge
while giving judgment that constitutes a precedent. The only thing in a Judge(cid:128)s decision binding a
party is the principle upon which the case is decided and for this reason, it is important to analyse a
decision and isolate from it the ratio decidendi. A decision is only an authority for what it actually
decides. Further in another case Union of India vs. Major Bahadur Singh, 2006 (1) SCC 368, the
Supreme Court observed that courts should not place reliance on decisions without discussing as to
how the factual situation fits in with the fact situation of the decision on which reliance is placed.
Observations of the courts are neither to be read as Euclid(cid:128)s theorems nor as provisions of the
statute and that too taken out of their context. These observations must be read in the context in
which they appear to have been stated. Judgments of the courts are not to be construed as statutes.
Judges interpret statutes, they do not interpret judgments. They interpret words of statutes; their
words are not to be interpreted as statutes. Circumstantial flexibility, one additional or different fact
may make a world of difference between conclusions in two cases. Disposal of cases by blindly
placing reliance on a decision is not proper.
None of the judgments cited by the appellant in the present case lay down the legal principle that
where proceedings are pending in a Civil Court involving similar issues, the Consumer Court should
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1234412/ 9M/S Hindustan Motors Ltd. vs Amardeep Singh Wirk & Ors. on 14 May, 2009
not exercise its jurisdiction and entertain a validly instituted complaint under the Consumer
Protection Act, 1986 or that it should stay its proceedings and await the decision of the Civil Court.
Further the judgments cited by the appellant have no relevance to the facts of the present case for
the reasons stated hereinabove.
15. On the contrary, the judgments of the Supreme Court, as noticed above, clearly state that as per
Section 3 of the Act the provisions of the Act are in addition to and not in derogation of any other
provision of any other law for the time being enforced. Having due regard to the scheme of the Act
and the purpose sought to be achieved to protect the interest of the consumers better, the provisions
are to be interpreted broadly, positively and purposefully to give meaning to additional/extended
jurisdiction, particularly when Section 3 seeks to provide remedy under the Act in addition to other
remedies provided under other Acts unless there is a clear bar.
16. In the light of the judgments discussed hereinabove, there is no room for any doubt that
proceedings under the Consumer Protection Act and in a Civil Court can simultaneously go on, even
if the issues involved in the two proceedings are substantially similar. The remedies are independent
of each other. The existence of parallel or other adjudicatory Forums cannot take away or exclude
the jurisdiction created under the Consumer Protection Act. It is also pertinent to mention that in
the present case, the proceedings in the Civil Court and those in the Consumer Forum have been
initiated by two different parties though, admittedly, their grievances relate to the same incident as
also the fact that the two parties are related. However, the fact remains that they are two
independent parties who have initiated independent and separate proceedings before this High
Court and the Consumer Forum.
17. The learned Single Judge has rightly declined to grant the relief to the appellants in the writ
petition filed by them. We see no infirmity in the order of the learned Single Judge to warrant any
interference by us. The appeal must fail. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. The pending
application stands disposed of.
