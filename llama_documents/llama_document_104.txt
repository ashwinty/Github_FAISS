JUDGMENT
D.A. Mehta, J.
1. This application has been moved seeking the following directions :
"5. In light of the aforesaid premises, the Applicant prays as under:
A. Your Lordship be pleased to direct that composite assets of both the lots of Wood
Polymers (In Liquidation) be sold to the Applicant at the price of Rs.315 lacs.
B. In the alternative, Your Lordship be pleased to direct bidding for the composite
assets of both lots of Wood Polymers (In Liquidation).
C. Pending notice, admission and final hearing of this Application, Your Lordship be
pleased to restrain the respondent No.1 from parting with the possession of the
movable assets auctioned in favour of the respondent No.7 by order-dated
14.10.2004 in Official Liquidator's Report no.56 of 2004.
D. Any further relief(s) as deemed fit may be granted to the Applicant as according to
the applicant, the applicant is offering a substantially higher amount for composite
properties of Wood Polymers Limited [hereinafter referred to as 'the Company (in
liquidation)'].
2. On 14-10-2004 an order came to be made by this Court in O.L.R. No.56 of 2004 whereunder sale
of all movable assets excluding land, building and records was confirmed in favour of M/s. Sterling
Lam Limited (respondent No.7) for a sum of Rs.178 lacs on the terms and conditions stated in the
order. Though the applicant has not made a prayer to set aside the aforestated order before any of
the prayers could be granted, if required to be granted, it would be necessary to recall and set aside
the order dated 14-10-2004.
3. Mr. Mihir H. Joshi, learned Senior Advocate appearing with Mr. Tanvish U. Bhatt, learned
advocate on behalf of the applicant, submitted that the approach of the Court in such matters has to
be, to consider as to what is in the larger interest of the body of creditors. That though numerous
attempts since 2000 were made the Sale Committee had not received any offer for land; that in fact
there was no serious offer for immovable property. Therefore, it was necessary for the Court to
consider whether the offer of Rs.315 crores made by the applicant for all the assets of the Company
(in liquidation) should be considered. That the Court must test the offer made by the applicant in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1888375/ 1Suraj Enterprises vs O.L. Of Wood Polymers Ltd. on 5 November, 2004
context of the bids that had been made in the past and while doing so the Court must bear in mind
that the attempt has to be to secure highest amount for composite assets, in other words, try to
ensure that most remunerative price is realised. Inviting attention to the OL's Report dated
23-09-2004 it was submitted that as the facts on record would show, the composite offer received by
respondent No. 1 viz. the Official Liquidator, was to the tune of Rs.281 lacs. 3.1 It was further
submitted that the Sale Committee had fixed the composite price and the earnest money deposit in
the following lots :
--------------------------------------------------------
Description Upset Price EMD
--------------------------------------------------------
Lot No.1 i.e. |A| Land Rs.75.00 Rs.07.50
office building lacs lacs
----------------------------------------
|B| All assets Rs.30.00 Rs.03.00
other than lacs lacs
land
----------------------------------------
|C| Composite Rs.1.05 Rs. 10.50
offer for A Crores lacs
and B above
--------------------------------------------------------
Lot No.2 i.e. |A| Land Rs.2.50 Rs.25.00
factory building Crores lacs
----------------------------------------
|B| All assets Rs.1.50 Rs.15.00
other than Crores lacs
land
----------------------------------------
|C| Composite Rs.4.00 Rs.40.00
offer for A Crores lacs
and B above
--------------------------------------------------------
while in fact the sale had been confirmed of all the assets other than land pertaining
to both Lot No. 1-B and Lot No. 2-B without publicity in relation to such lots. Mr.
Joshi, therefore, contended that in such circumstances, even if there was no
inadequacy attached to the price realized, it was incumbent upon the Court to
consider whether the subsequent offer, viz. the offer made now, for composite assets
was reasonable. That for this purpose, it was necessary that the Court should grant an
opportunity by probing further so as to ascertain what could be the price that could
be fetched if all the assets of the Company (in liquidation) were sold in composite lot.
That it was not the submission of the applicant that the applicant alone be permitted
to purchase the properties but the Court must invite, if necessary by publication of
advertisements, bidders for composite assets of the Company (in liquidation) so as to
obtain best possible price of the composite assets. He relied on decisions of Supreme
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1888375/ 2Suraj Enterprises vs O.L. Of Wood Polymers Ltd. on 5 November, 2004
Court reported in (i) (2000) 6 SCC 69; (ii) (2000) 6 SCC 79; (iii) (2000) 6 SCC 82.
4. Mr. Ashok L. Shah, learned advocate appearing with Mr. Dhanvin K. Puj on behalf of respondent
No. 7, submitted that even before examining the merits of the contentions raised by the applicant
the bona fides of the applicant were required to be tested. In this connection he invited attention to
the averments made in Paragraph No. 2 of the application as well as Paragraph No. 6 of the
rejoinder affidavit to submit that the applicant had made contrary statements in relation to the
business carried on by the applicant, the source of knowledge of the applicant and the circumstances
went to show that the present application is filed with ulterior motives and with a view to blackmail
and harass respondent No. 7.
4.1 Inviting attention to communication dated 18-10-2004 (Annexure-A) it was submitted that on
the one hand the applicant was seeking inspection of the unit of the Company (in liquidation) on
20-10-2004 and on the other hand the applicant was already in possession of the order dated
14-10-2004 at 12:03 hrs. on 18-10-2004 itself as could be seen from the computerised copy of the
order. Therefore, the applicant was in fact aware that the movable assets of the Company (in
liquidation) had already been sold in favour of respondent No. 7 and yet was trying to create
evidence by the said communication dated 18-10-2004. That the applicant had consciously
refrained from stating or bringing evidence on record to show as to when the said communication
was tendered in the office of respondent No. 1, the Official Liquidator. That prima facie it appeared
that the said letter was back dated taking into consideration the fact that the applicant had made
payment of the balance purchase consideration under forwarding letter dated 19-10-2004 by
tendering demand drafts for a sum of Rs.1.50 Crores, and Rs.21 lacs (Annexures A, B, and C to the
affidavit-in-reply). Mr. Shah further submitted that on the one hand the applicant was seeking
inspection of the properties of the Company (in liquidation) and on the other hand he was moving
the Court by way of present application offering a price of Rs.315 lacs without even inspecting the
properties. That in the entire application it was nowhere stated that pursuant to the said
communication dated 18-10-2004, the applicant was granted inspection of all the assets of the
Company (in liquidation); that in fact respondent No. 1 could not have granted such inspection in
light of the fact that on 19-10-2004 the sale was complete when the entire consideration was
tendered and the possession of the movable properties passed from respondent No. 1 to respondent
No. 7.
4.2 It was further submitted by Mr. Shah that the present offer was not comparable in as much as
the sale was only of all the movable assets, while the applicant was making a bid for composite
assets of the Company (in liquidation).
4.3 Inviting attention to provisions of Sections 19 and 20 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 (hereinafter
referred to as 'the Sale of Goods Act') Mr. Shah submitted that once possession of movable
properties was handed over the transaction was complete, respondent No. 7 became the owner of
the properties and it was not open to the Court also to thereafter disturb the possession and
ownership of respondent No. 7. That in light of this situation respondent No. 7 had already entered
into further transaction for sale of such assets as could be seen from Paragraph No. 15 of the
affidavit-in-reply wherein details regarding seven different parties and the respective amounts
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1888375/ 3Suraj Enterprises vs O.L. Of Wood Polymers Ltd. on 5 November, 2004
received/receivable from the said seven parties have been mentioned.
4.4 It was further submitted that it was not even the case of the applicant that the consideration was
inadequate in any manner, and if that be so, it was not open to the Court to disturb a concluded
contract. Inviting attention to the decisions of the Apex Court in:
i) Divya Manufacturing Company (P) Ltd. Tirupati Woolen Mills Shramik
Sanghaarsha Samity and Anr. v. Union Bank of India and Ors. Official Liquidator &
Ors., (2000) 6 SCC 69;
(ii) Lica (P) Ltd. v. Official Liquidator and Anr. (2000) 6 SCC 79;
(iii) Lica (P) Ltd. v. Official Liquidator and Anr. (2000) 6 SCC 82; it was submitted by
Mr. Shah that the Apex Court was dealing with cases involving immovable property
wherein the circumstances were that either the sale was yet to be confirmed or that
the Sale Deed was to be executed or the appeal was pending, coupled with the fact
that Condition No. 11 in the said cases permitted the Court to set aside a concluded
sale. That in the present case the Court was not required to exercise such jurisdiction
in absence of similar condition in the terms and conditions on which the contract was
executed by the parties; in other words, no power was reserved with the Court for
setting aside a concluded contract. Moreover, the Court had confirmed the sale of
movable assets and ownership of property had passed from respondent No. 1 to
respondent No. 7.
4.5 Lastly, it was submitted that the application was also otherwise required to be rejected in light of
provision of Rules 10 and 11 of the Companies (Court) Rules, 1959 (the Rules) which specifically
provided as to how application is to be made and what applications are to be made in the form of
petitions. That Rule 11(a) of the Rules would not apply and hence the application had to be in the
form prescribed under Rule 11(b) of the Rules viz. by way of Judge's Summons.
5. Mr. Sandeep Singhi, learned advocate appearing on behalf of respondent No. 2, one of the secured
creditors, submitted that as could be seen from the Minutes of the Meeting of the Sale Committee
held on 03-01-2003, on the basis of the valuation, the lots with schedule had been fixed by the Sale
Committee to invite inspection of the properties and offers from interested persons. That even if Lot
No. 1-B wherein the price was fixed at Rs.30 lacs and Lot No. 2-B wherein the price was fixed at
Rs.150 lacs were taken into consideration, the consolidated price was Rs.180 lacs against which the
sale had been confirmed in favour of respondent No. 7 at Rs.178 lacs, which was almost near to the
consolidated price and, therefore, it could not be stated that the price realized for all the movable
assets of the Company (in liquidation) was in any way inadequate so as to disturb the concluded
sale. That even otherwise, if the composite price for Lot No. 1-C and 2-C were taken into
consideration the composite price was fixed at Rs.4.75 crores as against Rs.5.05 crores if individual
composite price was totalled; against which the present applicant was offering only Rs.3.15 crores.
That in case the price realized for the movable properties was deducted from the offer made it
yielded a figure of Rs.137 lacs as against the consolidated composite price for land only, of Rs.325
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1888375/ 4Suraj Enterprises vs O.L. Of Wood Polymers Ltd. on 5 November, 2004
lacs, which worked out to about 40% i.e. Rs.137 lacs were being offered against Rs.325 lacs : land's
composite price. In the circumstances, it was submitted that the application was required to be
rejected.
5.1 That now only land of the Company (in liquidation) was required to be disposed of and it was
common knowledge that open plot of land would always fetch a better return. That with passage of
time in future, even after re-valuation, the creditors would be in a position to get better price if the
land was otherwise not having any superstructure or any other encumbrance thereupon. That
accordingly the offer was far too less and not attractive enough to be taken into consideration.
6. Mr. Mihir Joshi in rejoinder submitted that the contention regarding letter dated 18-10-2004
being back dated or having been filed later in point of time was not stated by respondent No. 1 - the
Official Liquidator and hence, the said aspect should not be a relevant consideration. Responding to
the submission regarding the applicant already being in possession of the order dated 14-10-2004
when the aforesaid letter dated 18-10-2004 was addressed to the Official Liquidator, Mr. Joshi
submitted that this issue was never raised earlier in point of time, otherwise the applicant would
have tendered appropriate reply. In relation to the contention regarding the contradiction about
business of the applicant, it was submitted that the applicant was in the business of trading in steel
and plant and machinery were definitely such items which would fall within the business of the
applicant. The contention regarding source of information about the properties of the Company (in
liquidation) being available was stated to be a business acquaintance at Surat as mentioned in
Paragraph No. 6 of the rejoinder. The contention that the applicant was making an offer even
without taking inspection of the properties was sought to be repelled by submitting that the
applicant who was a businessman was taking a business risk which was perceived by the applicant to
be in favour of the applicant viz. the applicant would earn out of purchase of such properties. In
relation to the contention regarding bona fides of the applicant it was submitted that the attempt
was nothing else but to stall an inquiry and the Court should not permit such an attempt.
6.1 Dealing with the contention that the sale was of movable properties, it was submitted that the
contention could not be countenanced that the Court would be helpless in such a situation. That the
sale was in terms of provisions of Rules 272 and 273 of the Rules and the Court had inherent powers
under Rule 9 of the Rules to ensure that justice is done. It was further submitted that on a conjoint
reading of provisions of Sections 19, 64 and 62 of the Sale of Goods Act it was apparent that the said
provisions cannot be invoked in absolute terms, and the proposition that the Court would become
functus officio once payment was made and delivery taken was too wide to be countenanced. That
the Court had to bear in mind the distinction between a confirmed sale and executed sale.
6.2 The technical objection regarding the application not being in prescribed form in light of the
Rules 10 and 11 of the Rules was sought to be met by stating that it would be a curable defect and if
required, the Court would exercise inherent powers under Rule 9 to permit the applicant to cure
such a defect. 6.3 Lastly, it was submitted that the price offered had not to be taken as the final bid
and it was to be treated as only the beginning. The test had to be as to whether discretion vested in
the Court was required to be exercised in the larger interest of the body of creditors or not.

7. Having heard the parties it is apparent that before deciding as to whether the application requires
to be granted or not on facts and circumstances of the case, it is necessary to briefly recapitulate the
relevant principles of law relatable to review or recall of an order as well as the position of law by
which the Court can interfere with concluded contract by way of auction sale for the purpose of
setting aside the same.
8. For the purpose of recalling an order or reviewing an order the jurisdiction that is required to be
exercised by the Court has to be on the principles enunciated while exercising jurisdiction under
Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure
stipulates various contingencies in which an application may be made for review of judgement of
this Court. Pre-requisite conditions prescribed in Rule 1 of Order 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure
are :
[i] On discovery of new and important matter or evidence which after the exercise of
due diligence was not within the knowledge or could not be produced at the time
when the order was made;
OR [ii] On account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record;
[iii] For any other sufficient reason.
If any one condition is shown to exist an order may be taken up for review. The
applicant has not been able to show that the present case would fall within the first
situation viz. discovery of new and important matter or evidence. Nor can it be stated
that there is some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record which would
permit this Court to exercise jurisdiction. In fact the application is silent in this
regard and the learned Advocate for the applicant has also not specified the condition
on fulfillment of which he is seeking review/recall of the order. The case of the
applicant is that there is a better offer made by the applicant and hence the order
requires to be reviewed/recalled. The words "any other sufficient reason" appearing
in Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure must mean a reason sufficient on
grounds at least analogous to those specified in the rule. (Ref : AIR 1995 SC 455 and
AIR 2000 SC 1650).
9. It is well settled that review proceedings are not by way of appeal and have to be strictly confined
to the scope and ambit of Order 47 Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Even if it is accepted that
the Court is empowered to exercise jurisdiction to prevent miscarriage of justice or to correct grave
and palpable errors committed by it, there are definitive limits to the exercise of the power of review.
The power of review is not an inherent power and unless and until it is conferred either specifically
or by necessary implication by law, the same cannot be exercised.
10. Applying the aforesaid principles to the facts of the case it is necessary to examine whether the
case of the applicant can fall within any of the conditions prescribed in Rule 1 of Order 47 of the
Code of Civil Procedure. Admittedly, it is not the case of the applicant that it has approached the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1888375/ 6Suraj Enterprises vs O.L. Of Wood Polymers Ltd. on 5 November, 2004
Court on discovery of any new and important matter or evidence which was not within the
knowledge of the applicant after the exercise of due diligence. In fact the circumstances do not even
indicate as to what was the applicant doing when the Sale Committee published advertisements
inviting offers. As can be seen from the report of the Official Liquidator dated 23-09-2004 the first
time a decision to invite offers for purchase of the assets of the Company by issuing advertisement
was taken on 19-12-2001. Thereafter, as decided at meeting held on 31-01-2002 once again
advertisements were published on 15-02-2002. Subsequently as per decision taken in meeting of
03-01-2003 advertisements were published on 16-01-2003. The applicant has not been able to
prima facie show as to why and how and in what circumstances the applicant did not respond to any
of the advertisements published by the Sale Committee. This becomes important in the context of
the averment made by the applicant that "The applicant submits that he is in the business of
purchase of land, plant & machinery of various industries.". A person who is in business would
definitely be aware of the advertisements published; may be one set of advertisements may be
overlooked by a person; to say that advertisements published thrice were not within the knowledge
of the applicant is not believable. In fact the applicant does not even state so. The applicant is
absolutely silent as to whether he had seen the advertisements or not. 11. In Paragraph No. 2 of the
application, the applicant further states that the applicant came to know from trade circles that
properties of the erstwhile Company are to be sold and, therefore, the applicant inquired about the
same "as no recent advertisement" for the same was published in any newspapers. The applicant
thereby gives credence to the belief that the applicant was aware that the advertisements had been
published in past but no recent advertisement had been published. If that be so, no explanation is
forthcoming why the applicant did not participate in any of the proceedings, either before the Sale
Committee or before this Court.
12. In light of the various averments made by respondent No. 7 in its affidavit-in-reply while dealing
with the contentions in Paragraph No. 5, the applicant has stated in rejoinder that "..... it is stated
that the applicant's business firm is formed in 2003 and is engaged in the business of trading in
steel. Thus, he is not aware of the earlier developments/advertisements in the said matter. The
applicant submits that on or about 2nd week of October, while the applicant was in Surat in
connection with his business, he was informed by a business acquaintance trading in plywood and
timber that there was a good business opportunity. He was informed that the assets of the erstwhile
company at Billimora, were up for sale and the project was capable of revival. The applicant was also
informed that if he was interested (after a viability report) or in any case the applicant was able to
purchase the total assets, then part of it would be assuredly purchased by him. .....". The aforesaid
extract would go to show that the applicant, in the rejoinder, is trying to explain away it's inaction by
stating that its business was formed in 2003 only and that the applicant was not aware of the earlier
developments / advertisements. If this statement is correct what is averred in Paragraph No. 2 of the
application is incorrect.
13. However, what is more damaging to the case of the applicant is that the applicant was informed
in the 2nd week of October at Surat that the assets of the Company (in liquidation) were up for sale
and the project was capable of revival. The applicant does not state in the entire application that it is
interested in purchasing the composite properties for the purpose of revival of the industry. Each of
these factors may independently not be of any significance, but when considered cumulatively, they
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1888375/ 7Suraj Enterprises vs O.L. Of Wood Polymers Ltd. on 5 November, 2004
would reflect adversely on the conduct of the petitioner. 14. Be that as it may. Assuming that these
are inconsequential factors and could be ignored, the case of the applicant may be examined in light
of the settled legal position by which the Court can interfere with a concluded contract by way of
auction sale.
14.1 The applicant has to show that there was some material irregularity and fraud. However, an
allegation in this regard is not enough. There must be adequate material to substantiate such
allegation. Further, the objector must show that such material irregularity resulted in substantial
injury to the Objector. In absence of such pleading and evidence in support thereof it is not open to
set aside an auction sale. (Ref. : Shri Ram Maurya v. Kailash Nath and Ors., AIR 2000 SC 3402 -
Shri Ram Maurya v. Kailash Nath and Ors.).
14.2 Other factors which would come into consideration are where the sale is conducted with undue
haste without any reserve or upset price being fixed; the valuation itself is suspect and there is
inadequate publicity resulting into situation where best possible price was not procured. These
factors cumulatively would affect an auction sale and would permit the Court to set aside the same
considering the Companies (Court) Rules, 1959. (Ref : AIR 1999 SC 1715 Allahabad Bank etc. etc. v.
Bengal Paper Mills Co. Ltd. and Ors.).
14.3 As already stated mere proof of material irregularity and inadequacy of price realized by itself
are not sufficient. What the objector has to establish is that not only there was inadequacy of price
realized but that, that inadequacy was caused by reasons of material irregularities or fraud. (Ref :
AIR 1971 SC 2337 Radhey Shyam v. Shyam Behari Singh)."
15. Considering the aforesaid principles it is apparent that on the facts of the case the applicant has
not even pleaded that inadequate price has been realized or that there is any material irregularity or
fraud in the auction sale confirmed vide order dated 14-10-2004. There is no pleading either that
any substantial injury is caused to the applicant. In short, none of the relevant factors are shown to
exist cause on facts of the case which would permit this Court to exercise jurisdiction and recall
order dated 14-03-2004 for the purpose of setting aside or cancelling the auction sale.
16. There is one more factor which has to be borne in mind. As can be seen from the facts on record
the Company (in liquidation) was ordered to be wound up on 14-12-1998. Therefore, admittedly, at
least from the said date the assets of the Company (in liquidation) have been lying idle. It is
common knowledge and judicial cognizance can be taken of the fact that the plant and machinery
which remain idle depreciate at a faster rate and become obsolete in no time. These assets are of
such a nature that with every passing day, the realizable value would depreciate. In the
circumstances, the contention raised on behalf of the applicant that the Sale Committee ought to
have waited for more bidders to come forward with composite offers, or that the Court direct such a
course of action today cannot be accepted. It is necessary to bear in mind that funds of secured
creditors, who are financial institutions and banks, are held up in such non-performing assets and
the earlier they are put in possession of funds realized from disposal of the assets is better for them,
because the secured creditors are admittedly dealing with the funds of the public at large. Hence, in
facts of the case, considering the nature of the assets it is not possible to accept the plea of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1888375/ 8Suraj Enterprises vs O.L. Of Wood Polymers Ltd. on 5 November, 2004
applicant.
17. In light of the fact that the sale was of movable assets of the Company (in liquidation) provisions
of the Sale of Goods Act may also be taken into consideration. Section 2(7) of the Sale of Goods Act
defines 'goods' to mean every kind of movable property.
17.1 Section 4 of the Sale of Goods Act defines what is 'Sale' and 'Agreement to Sell'. A contract of
sale of goods is a contract whereby seller transfers or agrees to transfer the property in goods to the
buyer for a price; such a contract of sale may be absolute or conditional. Where under a contract of
sale the property in the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer, the contract is called a sale,
but where the transfer of the property in the goods is to take place at a future time or subject to
some condition thereafter to be fulfilled, the contract is called an agreement to sell. Such an
agreement to sell becomes a sale when the time elapses or the conditions are fulfilled to which the
property in the goods is to be transferred. It follows that until the property in the goods has been
transferred from the seller to the buyer there is no sale. The contract of sale remains merely
executory till then; and it becomes executed the moment the property has passed to the buyer.
17.2 Section 19 of the Sale of Goods Act provides as to when the property passes. The section
recognizes the rule that in case of an agreement of consideration, whether the consideration consists
in some actual performance, as the payment of the price, or in a promise, express or implied, the
time of the transfer of property in goods depends upon the intention of the parties. The word
'intention' here means expressed intention. This becomes clear from sub-section (2) of Section 19.
The question of passing of property is normally a question of intention and the intention of the
parties must be gathered from the terms of the contract. As to when the parties intended the
property in the goods to be transferred is essential one of fact, subject only to the rules of
presumption for ascertainment of intention as indicated in Sections 20 to 24 of the Sale of Goods
Act. [DAULATRAM RAMESHWARLAL V. B.K. WADEYAR, 1957 (8) STC 617] 17.3 Under Section
19(2) of the Sale of Goods Act, for the purpose of ascertaining the intention, the Court shall have
regard to :-
(a) the terms of the contract,
(b) the conduct of the parties, and
(c) the circumstances of the case.
The Court may also have regard to the usage of trade.
17.4 Section 62 of the Sale of Goods Act pertains to exclusion of implied terms and conditions.
Where a contract of sale is silent, and expressly or impliedly makes no provision for all those
conditions/warranties/or terms, which the Act would imply in a contract of that nature, the parties
would have all such rights, duties and obligations as would arise under the contract of sale by
implication of law. It is not necessary for the parties to make any mention in the contract of all those
terms which the law will imply as having been incorporated in the contract. However, the Sale of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1888375/ 9Suraj Enterprises vs O.L. Of Wood Polymers Ltd. on 5 November, 2004
Goods Act does not compel the parties to make a contract according to the law and, therefore, the
parties may agree to any terms they please, provided that the contract does not become illegal. In
other words, the parties may exclude any of the terms or conditions which the law usually attaches
to a contract of sale and create for themselves any special rights, duties and obligations that they
desire.
17.5 Section 64 of the Sale of Goods Act which deals with auction sale primarily provides that a sale
is complete when the auctioneer announces its completion by the fall of the hammer and until such
announcement is made any bidder may retract his bid; that where the goods are put up for sale in
different lots, each lot is prima facie deemed to be the subject of a separate contract of sale.
However, in light of the provisions of Section 62 of the Sale of Goods Act it is possible for the
parties, by special agreement to vary some of the rights and obligations arising from such sale i.e.
the auction sale under Section 64 wherein certain implications may arise.
17.6 Section 47 of the Sale of Goods Act lays down as to when an unpaid seller of goods has lien over
the goods. The unpaid seller of goods who is in possession of the goods is entitled to retain
possession of the goods until the buyer makes payment of price, and the circumstances entitling the
unpaid seller lien over the goods are as stated in sub-section (1) of Section 47 of the Sale of Goods
Act. However, under Section 49 of the Sale of Goods Act situations in which lien gets terminated are
provided for. The unpaid seller of goods loses his lien when he delivers the goods and the buyer
obtains lawful possession. Hence "when the vendor has given the buyer possession under the
contract of sale, all his rights in the goods are completely gone; he must recover the price exactly as
he would recover any other debt (u), and has no longer any claims on the goods sold superior to
those of any other creditor. The delivery and acceptance of possession complete the sale, and give
the buyer the absolute unqualified and indefeasible rights of property and possession in the things
sold, though the price be unpaid and the buyer insolvent unless, indeed, the whole transaction is
vitiated by actual fraud"(v)." Source : Pollock & Mulla - The Sale of Goods Act, Fifth Edition.
18. Therefore, applying the aforesaid legal principles to the facts of the case it is apparent that
Section 64 of the Act cannot be applied ipso facto without taking into consideration provision of
Section 62 of the said Act. Once there is a statutory provision which permits that parties by special
agreement can vary some of the rights and obligations arising from sale under Section 64 of the Act,
the implications arising under Section 64 of the Act cannot be pressed into service in absolute terms.
19. On a conjoint reading of Sections 47 and 49 of the Sale of Goods Act, it is apparent that lien over
goods sold can exist only in specified circumstances and once the possession passes even if the seller
is not paid the price of the goods the lien is lost. Therefore, for the applicant to contend that
provision of Section 19 of the Sale of Goods Act cannot come into play is not supported by any
provision excluding the legal consequence. In fact as can be seen from the reply affidavit respondent
No. 7 has already entered into further contract of sale on being put into possession on payment of
entire sale consideration. In these circumstances, it is not possible for the Court to lightly intervene
by disturbing the concluded contract of sale. Mr. Joshi is correct to the extent when he submits that
the Court has a discretion vested in it. But the discretion has to be exercised in light of the factual
matrix available on record and the settled legal position. It goes without saying that the discretion of

the Court is not unbridled and merely for asking the same cannot be exercised.
20. The applicant and its offer do not inspire confidence. It is submitted that the Court must make a
probing inquiry to ascertain whether composite offer for an amount of Rs.315 lacs or more may be
received from the applicant and/or other bidders. If ultimately no other bidder appears, as in the
past, it may happen that the applicant may claim that the property be sold to the applicant for the
price offered; and even otherwise if some other bidder appears it is not sure as to whether the bid
would go higher. For that matter even the applicant may bid or may not bid. Therefore, the
application cannot be granted because the entire exercise would be in the realm of guesswork and as
already stated hereinbefore, the secured creditors and the workmen would have to wait for
realization of a reasonable price, and for how long one would not know. The assets which are already
disposed of, being of a depreciable nature, it is not possible to accept the contentions raised on
behalf of the applicant.
21. In the circumstances, the application stands rejected for the aforesaid reasons. The applicant
shall pay costs to respondent Nos.1 and 2 quantified at Rs.2,500/- (Rupees Two thousand Five
hundred only) each. Sd/-
