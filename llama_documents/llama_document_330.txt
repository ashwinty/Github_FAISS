JUDGMENT T. Meena Kumari, J.
1. As all the above CCCAs have been filed questioning the judgment and decree dated 3.4.2003 of
the learned XIII Additional Chief Judge, CCC (FTC), Hyderabad in OS. No. 69 of 2003 (Old OS No.
1201 of 1995), they have been clubbed together and are being disposed of by a common judgment.
2. The appellant in CCCA No. 74 of 2004 is the second defendant in the suit i.e., DBR Mills
Employees Union (Reg.No. B-947) affiliated to INTUC Rep. by its General Secretary D. Srinivas. The
appellant in CCCA No. 329 of 2003 i.e., M/s. Ranga Reddy Associates rep- by E.P. Ranga Reddy,
Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, is the third party to the suit and he filed the said CCCA with the leave of
this Court obtained on 22.9.2003 in CMP No. 20475 of 2003. However, the plaintiffs filed Review
CMPs to review the said order. Those Review Petitions have been listed before us. The appellant in
CCCA No. 350 of 2003 i.e., Dewan Bahadur Ramgopal Mills Limited (DBR Mills), 1-2-639,
Elechibagauda, Lower Tank Bund Road, Hyderabad rep. by its Chairman and Managing Director is
the Defendant No. 1 in the suit. Whereas the appellants in CCCA Sr.No. 55059 of 2003 are the third
parties to the suit and they sought leave in CMP No. 21957 of 2003 to file the above CCCA.
3. For the sake of convenience, the parties will be referred to as they were arrayed in the suit and the
third parties who filed CCCA Nos. 329 of 2003 and in CCCA Sr.No. 55059 of 2003 will be referred to
third parties.
4. The facts which are necessary for disposal of the present appeals are as follows:
Originally, the first plaintiff Mrs. Khorshad Shapoor Chennai filed OS No. 1201 of 1995, which was
subsequently re-numbered as OS No. 69 of 2003, against the first defendant seeking eviction from
the leased property claiming Rs. 30,000/-towards damages with interest at the rate of 6@ per
annum from the date of the suit, and Rs. 50,000/- to the first plaintiff towards the price of the half
of the tamarind trees with interest @ 6% per annum from the date of the suit and also claimed Rs.
10,00,000/- towards the wrongful deprivation of portion of the leased property with interest at the
rate of 6%, to pay Rs. 3,014/- to the first plaintiff towards the damages for wrongful occupation of
the leased property from 1.10.1995 with further damages at the rate of Rs. 1,00,000/- per annum till
eviction together with interest at the rate of 6% p.a., and for costs.
5. The case of the first plaintiff is that the plaint schedule property originally belong to late Khan
Bahadur Shapoor Edulji Chenoy and he had leased out the same to the first defendant under a
registered lease deed dated 17th Aban 1328 Fasli (1918 A.D.), that the lease is a perpetual lease for
999 years; and that the first plaintiff had succeeded to the property in a civil suit in OS No. 38 of
1967 on the file of the Chief Judge, CCC, Hyderabad. She contended that the first defendant failed to
pay rents from 1992 and they also cut the trees without her permission. The first plaintiff also stated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131255/ 1Ranga Reddy Associates vs K. Shapoor Chenai And Ors. on 12 April, 2004
in the plaint that a quit notice was issued under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act on
30.9.1995 terminating the lease with effect from 1.10.1995 and therefore the first defendant should
be evicted from the plaint schedule property. Hence, the first plaintiff filed the suit for eviction and
other reliefs as stated above.
6. The first defendant filed written statement opposing the claim for the first plaintiff for eviction
inter alia contending that the plaint schedule property was an Arazi Maqta granted to Khan
Bahadoor Shapoorji Chenoy by the late Nizam of Hyderabad. That this Chenoy had executed a
registered permanent lease over the plaint schedule property in favour of the first defendant on 13th
Aban 1328 Fasli and the first defendant has been in possession of the plaint schedule property since
then. The first defendant further contended that in 1955, the A.P. (Telangana Area) Abolition of
Inams Act, 1955 came into force and under the said Act, all Inams in the entire Telangana Area are
deemed to have been abolished and vested in the State. It is stated that under Section 9(2) of the
said Act, if the holder of the Inam Land or the lessee converted any part of the said land for any
purposes not connected with the agriculture, which is neither void nor illegal according to any other
law in force, he will be deemed to be the owner of the said land. The first defendant has contended
that a Memo No. 77508/J.A.I/93-94 dated 17.1.1994 was issued by the Secretary to the Government
wherein it is stated that the first defendant was the absolute owner of the entire land and another
letter No. B2/ 10268/1 dated 12.3.1994 was also issued by the Collector, Hyderabad District which
supported the contention that the first defendant was the owner of the land. The first plaintiff has no
interest, title or semblance of any right over the plaint schedule land. The first defendant further
contended that by the date of coming into force of the A.P. (Telangana Area) Abolition of Inams Act,
1955, the land was included in the holding of the first defendant and after the Act also, it vested in
the first defendant who owned it before that date. The case of the first defendant is that its
possession, occupation and holding as permanent tenant are now enlarged as owners and
recognized by the authorities vide Government Memo No. 7508/J.A.I/93-94 dated 17.1.1994 and
No. B2/10268/1 dated 12.3.1994. The first defendant further contended that the lessor and lessee
relationship between the first plaintiff and Defendant No. 1 ended in 1950 itself and that the first
plaintiff was not entitled to claim rents from the first defendant and that under a mistake the
defendant paid some amounts to the first plaintiff. In any event the first plaintiff is not the owner or
lessor of the plaint schedule property and she has no locus standi to maintain the suit for eviction or
other reliefs. There is no subsisting lease at all and the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act are
not attracted to the facts of these appeals.
The first defendant further stated in his written statement that it was declared as a Sick Industry.
The entire matter is pending with the BIFR, New Delhi and the Defendant No. 1 cannot transfer the
assets of the Mill and the first plaintiff is not entitled to any relief in the suit.
During the pendency of the suit, Ashish Developers and Builders (P) Limited rep. by its Managing
Director Sri Raj Kumar Malpani filed IA No. 2457 of 1998 before the Trial Court to come on record
as second plaintiff and the same was ordered on 15.3.1999. IA No. 97 of 1999 was filed by the DBR
Mills Employees union (Regd.No. B-947) affiliated to INTUC rep. by its General Secretary D.
Srinivas come on record as second defendant and the same was dismissed by the Trial Court on
17.3.1999. Later, the DBR Mills employees Union carried the matter before this Court in CRP No.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131255/ 2Ranga Reddy Associates vs K. Shapoor Chenai And Ors. on 12 April, 2004
2728 of 2000 and this Court allowed the said CRP on 17.9.2001. Hence, the DBR Mills Employees
Union came on record as the second defendant.
In the meanwhile, plaintiffs 1, 2 and Defendant No. 1 have agreed to compromise the matter and
accordingly filed IA No. 359 of 1999. Later, the second defendant also came forward to sail with
them and agreed for compromise as the first defendant authorities and Plaintiff No. 2 agreed to
safeguard the interest of the second defendant. The first plaintiff, second plaintiff and the first
defendant also deposed agreeing for compromise before the Court below on 15.6.1999. In view of the
compromise reached between the parties, the suit was disposed of in terms of such compromise on
3.4.2003.
7. Questioning the said judgment and decree, the above CCCAs have been filed.
8. The main contention urged on behalf of the learned Counsel for the first defendant in CCCA No.
350 of 2003 was that the Court below ought not to have passed the decree in terms of the
compromise petition filed on 8.3.1999 in IA No. 359 of 1999 under Order 23, Rule 3 of CPC. The
learned Counsel has further argued that the first defendant is deemed to be the owner of the land in
its occupation in terms of Sub-section (2) of Section 9 of the A.P. (Telangana Area) Abolition of
Inams Act, 1955 (for short 'Inams Abolition Act'). Further, it is also urged that the Government of
Andhra Pradesh, Revenue (UC-III) Department in exercise of its powers under Section 34 of the
Urban Land Ceiling Act, 1976 issued a notice to the first plaintiff and others including the first
defendant that it has decided to set aside the orders of the Special Officer and Competent Authority,
Hyderabad dated 19.1.1984 passed in file No. F1/1368/76. Therefore even the transfer of six acres of
land to the second plaintiff under the compromise filed on 16.3.1999 becomes illegal as such land
came under the purview of the ULC Act, 1976. The learned Counsel further contends that such
transfer is hit by Section 5(3) of the ULC Act. Since the compromise which was legal when it was
filed into Court on 8.3.1999 became unlawful and illegal by 3.4.2003, the date on which the Trial
Court pronounced its judgment in terms of the compromise. The learned Counsel further submits
that when time was sought to file a detailed objections for recording of the compromise, the Court
below ought not to have pronounced the impugned judgment. The learned Counsel further contends
that under explanation to Order 23, Rule 3 of CPC, it is the duty of the Court to satisfy itself that the
compromise entered into is lawful, but the Trial Court without satisfying itself as to whether such
compromise is lawful or not passed the judgment and decree and hence the same is liable to be set
aside. The learned Counsel further contends that under Section 5(3) of the ULC Act, a transfer of
excess vacant land is null and void and such transfers are also illegal under Section 23 of the
Contract Act, 1872.
9. The learned Counsel further submits that in view of the Memo of the State Government dated
17.12.1994 and the letter of the District Collector dated 12.3.1994, the first defendant is the owner of
the plaint schedule land and as such the very suit for eviction by Plaintiff No. 1 against Defendant
No. 1 is not maintainable as there is no landlord and tenant relationship in between them. It is
stated that no consideration has been passed under the terms of the compromise for transfer of Ac.
6.00 to the first defendant and hence the compromise is void in the eye of law. Further, it has been
contended that the first defendant has been declared as 'Sick Company' as defined under Section
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131255/ 3Ranga Reddy Associates vs K. Shapoor Chenai And Ors. on 12 April, 2004
3(o) of the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985 and as such any transfer of the
land in occupation of the first defendant without permission of the BIFR is illegal.
10. The learned Counsel for the appellant in CCCA No. 74 of 2004 i.e., second defendant in the suit,
submits that by virtue of the impugned judgment and decree, the valuable rights of the second
defendant are under jeopardy and if the said judgment is allowed to stand, it would result in
perpetuating the fraud played by the plaintiffs in the suit in collusion with the Management and the
judgment and decree is contrary to Order 23, Rule 3 of CPC and therefore the impugned judgment
and decree has to be set aside and the matter may be remanded to the Trial Court.
11. The appellant in CCCA No. 329 of 2003 is not a party to the suit. But, it filed the above CCCA
with the leave obtained from this Court in CMP No. 20475 of 2003. The learned Counsel for the
appellant in the CCCA Sri G. Veera Reddy submits that Plaintiff No. 1 is not the owner of the plaint
schedule land and the first defendant is the owner of the land in question in view of the fact that
after coming into force of the Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Abolition of Inams Act, 1955, under
Section 9 of the said Act, a person who owns the buildings has title to the said land. Since the first
defendant owns a building, ownership lies to the first defendant. The learned Counsel also reiterated
the same contentions advanced on behalf of the first defendant with regard to the ownership of the
land in question.
12. It has been submitted that the DBR Mills under the erstwhile Management became adverse in
1979-80 and the Management was changed in favour of Sri Krishnama Raju of Larsving Group. DBR
Mills was declared Sick Industrial Company under Section 15(1) of the Sick Industrial Companies
Act, 1985 and on 3.10.1987 BIFR appointed IFCI as operating agency for rehabilitation but the same
has not been implemented because of the existing promoter did not show any interest and the unit
was virtually abandoned and therefore the BIFR intended to windup DBR Mills and to that effect a
show-cause notice was issued. To the said show-cause notice, the appellant in CCCA No. 329 of
2003 informed that it is interested in taking over in DBR Mills and deposited sum of Rs. 50 lakhs in
no-lien accounts with the State Bank of Hyderabad and accordingly the DBR Mills were taken over
by the RR Associates. He further contends that no suit is maintainable against the first defendant
under Section 22 of the Sick Industrial Company Act, 1985.
13. The learned Counsel further contends that in a suit for eviction and damages, the Court below
ought not to have impleaded the second plaintiff. The Court below should have seen that the
compromise entered into between the Plaintiff No. 2 and S. Krishnama Raju who is no more the
Managing Director of DBR Mills is collusive one and is also opposed to the public policy. The Court
below should have seen that the parties in the suit wanted a judgment and decree with regard to the
land over which they did not have any right whatsoever. He further submits that the competent
authority deleted the said land from holding of Plaintiff No. 1 which has become final and hence the
first plaintiff cannot be termed as a Landlady. The learned Counsel further contends that the lower
Court should have seen that when the matter is pending before the BIFR, it should not have passed
judgment and decree in terms of compromise on the basis of the orders of AAIFR dated 6.1.2000.

14. The appellants in CCCA Sr.55059 of 2003 are the third parties to the suit and they want to prefer
this appeal with the leave of this Court. The appellants herein are the Trade Union Leaders and with
a view to safeguard the interest of the employees of the DBR Mills Limited they want to file the
present appeal. The main contention of the appellants herein are that the suit is not maintainable.
The Court below ought not to have decreed the suit in terms of the compromise since entering of the
compromise itself is illegal and if the same is not set aside, the interest of the employees would be
put to untold hardship.
15. With the background of the facts of the case, the learned Counsel for the appellants in CCCA No.
329 and 350 of 2003 have brought to the notice of this Court the provisions of Inam Abolition Act
and the Urban Land Ceiling Act. It has also been contended that the compromise is opposed to the
public policy as contained under Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act. The case of the appellants is
that the assets of the first defendant are not transferable as the proceedings are pending before BIFR
and any transfer of property in respect of which BIFR proceedings are pending, the same cannot be
acted upon.
16. It has been contended that as per Order 43, Rule 1(A)(2) of CPC 1908, even though the suit is
disposed of in terms of compromise, an appeal can be maintainable by raising a plea that the
appellants are entitled to contest the decree on the ground that the compromise should not have
been recorded. It has also been argued that in pursuance of the order of the BIFR granting
injunction, the Court below ought not to have recorded the compromise decree.
17. The learned Counsel appearing in CCCA No. 74 of 2004 i.e., Defendant No. 2, has also argued
that in the terms of compromise, the mode of payment was not mentioned in terms of the
compromise and the second defendant would not get any benefit out of the compromise. He also
contends that the rights of the workmen have not been safeguarded. The learned Counsel adopted
the arguments of the Counsel appearing in CCCA No. 350 of 2003 in all other aspects i.e., the first
defendant is the owner of the land in view of the Inams Abolition Act and recognizing the ownership
of the first defendant over the land by the Government and the District Collector in their letters in
1994 itself.
18. Contradicting the above pleadings, the Counsel appearing on behalf of the plaintiffs has argued
that the appellants cannot be permitted to raise the pleas contrary to the findings of the lower Court
and contrary to the facts of the case. It has also been contended that the appellants are precluded
from urging the new facts. The learned Counsel for the second plaintiff has argued that Defendant
No. 1 company is not the owner of the land and the lease hold right does not confer ownership on
the lessee in view of the provisions of Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. It has also been
argued that once the quit notice was issued, the relationship of the landlord and tenant would be
terminated and the first defendant would be called as Tenant at Sufferance. He further contended
that as per Section 9 of CPC, all lawful civil rights are enforceable. The learned Counsel further
contends that a suit for eviction is maintainable against the first defendant as per Section 22 of the
Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985. The learned Counsel has also advanced
his arguments that the compromise can be entered into in a suit for eviction by the landlord and the
compromise cannot be a replica of the plaint and in a compromise, a deviation can be made from
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131255/ 5Ranga Reddy Associates vs K. Shapoor Chenai And Ors. on 12 April, 2004
the original claims of the parties before the Court.
19. The learned Counsel for the plaintiffs contends that the defendants have chosen to contest the
suit by filing a written statement and meanwhile the parties have reached the compromise. The
learned Counsel has further argued that after amendment to the CPC in the year 1976, the
legislature has thought that the compromise can go beyond the subject-matter of the suit so long as
it is not unlawful. It is submitted that the facts relied upon by the appellants do not contemplate a
case. It has also been argued that the proceedings of the BIFR do not confer title on the first
defendant and even if those orders confer or recognize the title of the first defendant, the same have
no force at all as those orders have not been passed by the Civil Court or any authority under Urban
Land Ceiling Act etc., and hence the first defendant cannot take shelter from the orders of the BIFR.
20. Referring to the arguments of the learned Counsel for the appellants with regard to the
provisions of the Urban Land Ceiling Act, the learned Counsel has argued that the subject-matter
under BIFR is the assets of the company and hence the land in question in the suit cannot become
the assets of the company. It is his further contention that no injunction has been passed by any
authorities restraining the first defendant from entering into a compromise over the suit schedule
property as the fact of tenancy is not in dispute. The learned Counsel also further argued with
reference to the provisions of the Inams Abolition Act that as per Section 9 of the said Act, there is
no waste of the land as the land is not agricultural land and the possession of the tenant would
amounts to permissible possession on behalf of the owner. It has also further argued that the orders
passed by the different authorities is with regard to the computation of the land of the landlord and
tenant and no final orders have been passed.
21. The learned Counsel further contends that the compromise will not deviate the provisions of law
and is not opposed to public policy. Further submits that there was a cloud in the title of the land
before compromise and the same was removed by virtue of the compromise. The orders of the
different authorities did not say that 16 acres which is the subject-matter of the compromise is not
protected. The learned Counsel has further argued that out of 16 acres, 10 acres have been shared by
the tenant i.e., Defendant No. 1 and six acres by Plaintiff No. 2 in pursuance of the agreement
entered into with the Plaintiff No. 1 and the surplus area will go to the tenant, which is the
subject-matter pending before the Urban Land Ceiling Act.
In view of the fact that the respective parties are in possession of the property and no land has been
vested with the Government and as the Government has no authority whatsoever as the land did not
vest with the Government, the agreement as well as the compromise entered into between the
parties is not opposed to the public policy.
22. During the pendency of the cases, the second plaintiff i.e., second respondent in CCCA No. 350
of 2003 filed CMP No. 6476 of 2004 requesting this Court to receive the following documents and to
mark them as Exs.A1 to A8:
1. Proceedings of the BIFR dated 31.5.1996 in Case No. 109/87
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131255/ 6Ranga Reddy Associates vs K. Shapoor Chenai And Ors. on 12 April, 2004
2. Proceedings of the BIFR dated 12.3.1996 in Case No. 109/87
3. Proceedings of the BIFR dated 22.1.1996 in Case No. 109/87
4. Proceedings of the BIFR dated 16.6.1995 in Case No. 109/87
5. Affidavit of the MD of R1 firm dated 28.4.1999 in WP No. 10110 of 1999
6. Order of AAIFR dated 14.10.1996 in Appeal No. 151 of 1996 counter
7. Affidavit filed by Mr. Krishnam Raju, MD. of R1 in CRP No. 2728 of 2000 dated 12.7.2001
8. Order under Section 269 UL(1) of the I.T. Act, 1961 in file No. AA/HYD/1 (85)4/98-99 dated
23.7.2001 in favour of the petitioner, R2."
23. The appellant in CCCA No. 350 of 2003 filed CMP No. 30407 of 2003 and CMP No. 6634 of
2004 to receive the following documents and to mark them as Exs.B1 to B4:
1. Memo No. 60432/UC.III (1)/93-5 dated 14.10.2002
2. Certified copy of the order of the BIFR dated 13.4.1994
3. Certified copy of the order of the BIFR dated 2.12.1994
4. Original order of the Special Officer and . Competent Authority, ULC, Hyderabad in Pro.No.
H1/7543/76 dated 31.12.1993 The above CMPs to receive and mark those documents as Exs.A1 to
A8 and Exs.B1 to B4 have been allowed and those documents were marked with the consent of all
the parties as they are necessary to appreciate the contentions and for adjudication of the matter.
24. With regard to the pleas raised by the workers union i.e., Defendant No. 2, (CCCA No. 74 of
2004), the learned Counsel for the second plaintiff Sri Md. Ali submits that the Workers Union is
not a landlord and it has nothing to do with the compromise entered into. He further submits that
out of the protected area of 16 acres, 10 acres will go to Defendant No. 1 and six acres will go to
Plaintiff No. 2 and the surplus six acres would enure to the benefit of the Defendant No. 2 as the
same is still pending with the Government. The learned Counsel has further argued that it is not the
case of the tenant that the compromise was entered into by playing fraud and as there is no
allegation of fraud, the compromise as recorded by the Court below cannot be set aside.
25. The argument of the first defendant before the BIFR was that it should be treated as a Sick
Company. Later, it has shifted his stand before the authorities on different occasions and hence he
cannot go beyond the statement made before the different authorities and also his own deposition
before the lower Court which was made on oath on 15.6.1999.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131255/ 7Ranga Reddy Associates vs K. Shapoor Chenai And Ors. on 12 April, 2004
26. The learned Counsel for the plaintiffs has further argued that the appellant in CCCA No. 329 of
2003 has filed IA No. 981 of 1999 to come on record as one of the defendants in the suit but the
same was dismissed on 20.1.2003. The appellant did not question the said dismissal order by filing
revision and without doing so, he filed the appeal with the leave of the Court. The learned Counsel
has further argued that the observations made by the earlier Bench while granting leave are not
binding as the same were made while, dealing with an interlocutory application.
27. The learned Counsel for the plaintiffs submits that the first defendant has taken different stands
before the different authorities. He further contends that the first defendant filed SLP (Civil) No.
17294 of 1998 against the dismissal of the writ petition by the Delhi High Court in CWP No,4283 of
1996 and the said SLP has been withdrawn before the Apex Court on 18.11.1998 on the ground that
he is going to compromise. Thus, he contends that the first defendant with an intention to put an
end to the litigation has entered into compromise and at no point of time, he stated that the
compromise was entered into by playing fraud. The learned Counsel for the plaintiffs has argued
that the agreement was entered into and payments were made to the respective parties and the
landlady of the land attested the compromise. The learned Counsel has further re-iterated his
argument that the land is not the asset of the company and no injunction as such from any of the
authorities including BIFR and SICA to transfer the land.
28. As the appellants have argued at length referring to different provisions of the statutory
enactments, we had to go necessarily into the arguments with reference to the provisions referred by
them from various enactments like Inams Abolition Act and Urban Land Ceiling Act and the various
orders of the BIFR and the additional evidence adduced.
29. The undisputed fact remains that the suit has been field by the plaintiff for eviction of the
appellant in CCCA No. 329 of 2003 on the ground of committing default of payment of rent payable
for lease for the Fasli 1403 to 1404 i.e., 1993 to 1993. A perusal of the documents show that the first
defendant filed a statement under Section 6(1) of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976
and in pursuant to the same, the competent authority has declared the protected area in
Proceedings No. H1/7543/76 dated 31.12.1993 which is marked as Ex.B4. In the said proceedings,
the ULC Authorities have declared the protected area as follows:
"The total area protected and the vacant land available in the premises are as follows:
1. Total area ...87692.00
2. Area protected:
i. Non-vacant land ...1041.05
ii. Dwelling units ...15336.00
iii. Non-dwelling units ... 47014.95
...63392.00
----------
Balance ..24300.00
-----------
Out of the vacant land of 24300.00 square meters, the declarant firm is entitled to retain 1000.00 square meters under Section 4(i)(b) of the Act and the remaining area of 23300.00 square meters of vacant land held by the declarant firm is in excess of the ceiling limit."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131255/ 8Ranga Reddy Associates vs K. Shapoor Chenai And Ors. on 12 April, 2004
30. Ex.B3 is the notice issued by the Government of Andhra Pradesh Revenue (UC.III) Department in Memo No. 60432/ UC.III(1)/93-5 dated 14.10.2002 for computation of the holding of the landlady i.e., Plaintiff No. 1 and others. In the said notice, it has been observed as follows;
< "And whereas, the Government after careful examination, in exercise of powers conferred on them
under Section 34 of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulations) Act, 1976, have decided to set aside
the orders of the Special Officer and Competent Authority, Hyderabad dated 19.1.1984 passed in the
file No.F1/ 1368/76 and direct him to recomputed the holdings of Mrs. F.R. Chenoy, Mrs. K.S.
Chenoy and Master Darious Chenoy by including the lands which were given to D.B.R. Mills on
perpetual lease as per provision of explanation under Section (2)(1) of the Urban Land (Ceilings and
Regulation) Act, 1976, as the orders are not in conformity with the aforesaid provisions of Act."
31. During the course of arguments, much reliance has been placed on various orders of the BIFR
and therefore we are constrained to look into the orders passed by different authorities for proper
adjudication of the subject-matter of the appeal.
32. The order of the BIFR in Case No. 109/87(020/94) dated 31.5.1996, relating to the first
defendant company, is marked as Ex.A1. At paras 3 and 4 it has been observed as follows;
"xxx xxx We have carefully considered the matter and taken into account all the contentions put
forward on behalf of DBR Mills Limited in their Memorandum dated 18.12.1995 and papers filed
thereafter. Without prejudice to our later observations, we find that the company has failed to
submit any certificate or declaration or order of any competent Court or authority which
conclusively establishes that the type of title that this company had over this land since it had
become a lessee of the person or persons who had been allotted this land originally has changed in
the manner, as claimed by the Company. It has been claimed that the Andhra Pradesh Government,
has, by its order Lr.No. B2/10268/91 dated 12.3.1994 issued a clarification under the provisions of
Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Inams Abolition Act, 1955 that the informant , company should
be deemed to be the owner of the aforesaid demised Inam land. According to the company, the
Government's order has further clarified that there is no need for any authority to give any such
authentication or any order to indicate that the informant company is the owner. We have perused
the copy of the said order which has been submitted by the company. The same does not specifically
refer to vesting of any title in the land in the company. It only clarifies the general legal position as
was stated to obtain under Sub-section (2) of Section 9 of the Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area)
Abolition of Inams Act, 1955. The State Government order talks about the holder of the Inams land
being deemed to be the owner of the said land subject to certain conditions and provisions. The last
sentence of the order significantly says that it is for the person who owns the building to assert his
title based on such relevant documents. Evidently, this cannot be construed as an order proving the
title of the company in the land in question. On the other hand, the representative of the
Government of Andhra Pradesh submitted in the hearing held on 22.1.1996 that the matter
regarding ownership has been going on with them since 1988 and the company's M.D. had filed
applications at least on three occasions from 1988 onwards claiming ownership on the land which
according to the Government is not correct. He also stated that the lease for the land was initially
given in the name of one Shri Shapur Shenoy and not in the name of the company.

4. It is seen from the documents submitted by the company that it continued to pay the lease rent to
Mrs. K.S. Chenoy till around 1994 when it unilaterally stopped what it calls unlawful payments of
rents whereupon a suit was filed by Mrs. Chenoy before the Hon'ble Court of 4th Additional Judge,
City Civil Court at Hyderabad in OS No. 1201 of 1995 which is being contested. This further shows
that the company does not have any undisputed title over the land, as claimed by it.
5. Under the provisions of SICA, from which we derive our authority, we are not competent to
decide any question as to the title over the land.
xxxx"
33. In Ex.A2, BIFR Order dated 12.3.1996, the BIFR observed as follows:
"..... Had the company accounted for the land in its books at the time when it became owner it would
not have been in a position to present the picture which it is trying to do today. At this stage,
however, the question of title is also a subject-matter of dispute with the heirs of original lessor to
whom the company was paying lease rentals till very recently and who have reportedly filed a writ in
the High Court after the company unilaterally stopped these payments in 1994.
4. ..... The Bench pointed out that they are not trying to interpret API Act. This has to be done either
by Government of Andhra Pradesh or some Civil Courts where the title of the land is asserted.
5..... The Bench again pointed out that the ownership of company was not being ascertained as it
was not a matter falling under SICA...."
34. Another order of the BIFR dated 22.1.1996 is marked as Ex.A3 wherein the following
observations have been made:
"3. ..... The Bench observed that the referred memo from Government provides only a clarification
regarding interpretation of law and is in no way a certificate conveying ownership to the company.
4..... On being asked whether the company is claiming ownership of land today, Shri Rangaraju
submitted that they are clear that ownership vests with them and their claim to be considered today
is not regarding ownership but regarding its net worth being positive on account of which it is
seeking discharge from BIFR.xXXX, The Government's reply even now in no way confirms
ownership of land by the company...."
35. The affidavit filed by the first defendant in WP No. 10199 of 1999 in support of the said writ
petition questioning the orders of the Appellate Authority for Industrial and Financial
Reconstruction rep. By its Registrar, New Delhi and others in Appeal No. 144/98 dated 13.4.1999 is
marked as Ex.A5. In Ex.A5, the first defendant stated as follows with regard to the fact of entering
into the compromise of the suit in question:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131255/ 10Ranga Reddy Associates vs K. Shapoor Chenai And Ors. on 12 April, 2004
"The said SLP came up for hearing before, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India on 18.11.1998 then
the Petitioner No. 1 withdrew the SLP stating that it would move the High Court in review and point
out that a suit in regard to the land in dispute is pending and that it is about to be compromised and
that the petitioner is willing to pay of all the creditors. The petitioner submits that the suit No.
1201/95 on the file of the IV Senior Civil Judge, CCC, Hyderabad and is now compromised and the
compromise memo and affidavit of the Inamdar are herewith filed as Document Nos. 3 and 4."
36. The Appellate Authority for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction, New Delhi in its order
dated 14.10.1996 observed as follows:
"The learned Counsel for the 13th respondent submitted that the provisions of the State Act do not
have any application at all to the appellant as the appellant is not an inamdar coming within the
purview of the Act. It is the admitted case that the land in question was taken on perpetual lease by
the appellant from Inamdar. The State Act confers benefits only to the Inamdars as tenants as
occupants of agricultural lands and that too on payment of premium as per law. Counsel urged that
a person like the appellant having the leasehold right under the Inamdar cannot claim the status of
Inamdar or claim any right of inamdar and his position can only be as a lessee and nothing more
than that."
37. The second defendant filed CRP No. 2728 of 2000 aggrieved by the order of the IV Senior Civil
Judge, CCC, Hyderabad in IA No. 97 of 1999 dated 17.3.1999 wherein the request of the DBR Mills
Employees Union to come on record as second defendant was rejected. In the said CRP, Sri S.
Krishnam Raju being the Chairman and Managing Director of the first defendant filed counter. It
was marked as Ex,A7. In Ex.A7, the stand taken by the first defendant at para 10 is as follows:
"With reference to para 5, I deny that the petitioner (second defendant herein) will be benefited if
M/s. Ranga Reddy Associates (new promoter) takes over the management of the sick unit. It is true
that a compromise memo was filed before the Court below. However a compromise decree has not
been passed till date. Xxx The development if any envisaged under the compromise is only for a
small portion of the area under occupation and does not envisage destruction of the factory building.
38. A perusal of the above orders would go to show that there is no order of injunction prohibiting
any of the authorities from entering into any agreement nor any order has been placed before this
Court that the land is the asset of the first defendant. Thus, the claim of the first defendant that the
land in question belongs to it has no force at all.
39. The next question that remains is the compromise decree and judgment can be set aside in the
absence of the plea that the compromise was reached by playing fraud. It is not the case of any of the
parties to these CCCAs that the compromise was entered into by playing fraud and hence the
question of setting aside the said judgment and decree on the ground of playing fraud on the Court
does not arise.
40. The next contention urged on behalf of the appellants is that the Court below should not have
recorded the compromise as the said compromise itself is illegal and hence the judgment and decree
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131255/ 11Ranga Reddy Associates vs K. Shapoor Chenai And Ors. on 12 April, 2004
of the Court below is liable to be set aside.
41. The defendants did not bring to the notice of the Court below which terms of compromise would
be termed as illegal and the reason for such either by way of affidavit or counter and therefore the
Court below cannot presume that the terms of the compromise are illegal. Since the compromise
petition has been filed and after recording the sworn statement of the Managing Director of the first
defendant and other persons to the suit, the Court below acted upon the said compromise petition
and hence the contention of the appellants that the compromise itself is illegal and has no force.
42. It has to be looked into whether the compromise entered into by the parties fulfills the
requirements of Order 23, Rule 3 of CPC. It has to be seen that the compromise was signed by the
second plaintiff and Defendant No. 1 and also the Defendant No. 2 which was attested by the first
plaintiff. The learned Counsel for the second plaintiff has argued that as the agreement of
compromise is not void, it does not fit into the explanation to Order 23, Rule 3 of CPC.
43. It has been argued that the appellant's Managing Director in CCCA No. 350 of 2003 i.e.,
Managing Director of the first defendant, has given sworn statement in the compromise petition
before the Court below. In that statement, he stated as follows:
"On 15.3.1999, we have compromised the matter along with first plaintiff. Accordingly, we have filed
the compromise memo. I have gone through the various terms and conditions of the said
compromise memo and they are correct. In pursuance of the agreement entered with us, the second
plaintiff paid Rs. 1 core 50 lakhs to us. As per the original agreement between us and the second
plaintiff and also as per the understanding reached, it is the second plaintiff who has to bear all the
expenses requires in connection with the execution of any registered documents, obtaining
permission and sanctions from the appropriate authorities. Out of the total extent of 22 acres, the
agreement between us and second plaintiff is subject of 16 acres. Which is cleared by ULC. Out of
this 16 acres, the rights in 6 acres is exclusively given to second plaintiff. It is further agreed that
remaining 10 acres shall belong to defendant. Similarly the balance 6 acres of land in respect of
which matter is pending in the High Court and Government shall belong to defendant."
From the above sworn statement, it is clear that the first defendant entered into an agreement with
the second plaintiff. Pursuant to the said agreement, the first defendant received Rs. 1.50 crores
from the Plaintiff No. 2 prior to date of giving his sworn statement i.e., 15.6.1999. Having received
the said amount in the year 1999, the first defendant cannot be permitted to say in the year 2003
that entering into the said compromise itself is illegal.
44. The order of the Income Tax Authorities dated 23.7.2001 issued to the first plaintiff has been
marked as Ex.A8. In Ex.A8, it has been noted that as per the agreement dated 3.12.1998, the sale
consideration was paid. The Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax, office of the Appropriate
Authority, Bangalore has clarified that this 'no objection' applies only to the transferors) and
transferee(s) whose name(s) are specified on top of this certificate.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131255/ 12Ranga Reddy Associates vs K. Shapoor Chenai And Ors. on 12 April, 2004
45. The learned Counsel further contends that the appellants in CCCA No. 329 of 2003 and CCCA
Sr.No. 5509 of 2003 are not aggrieved persons and they cannot challenge the compromise decree.
We find force in the contentions of the learned Counsel for the plaintiffs. It has to be seen that they
are neither affected parties nor parties to the suit and therefore this Court is of the view that the
appeals filed by them i.e., CCCA No. 329 of 2003 and CCCA Sr.No. 5509 of 2003 are liable to be
dismissed on that ground alone.
46. The learned Counsel for the second plaintiff has further argued that the first defendant having
derived the benefit under the compromise cannot challenge it on the ground that the compromise
ought not to have been recorded. It is also argued that one of the Counsel have attacked the
compromise decree on the ground of fraud. But, no material to show that the plaintiffs played fraud
have been filed except raising a bald allegation that the compromise decree is vitiated by way of
fraud. In the absence of any material to show that one of the parties to the suit played fraud, it is not
safe to set aside the compromise decree particularly in view of the fact that the first defendant
benefited by receiving the consideration from out of the said compromise decree.
47. The learned Counsel for the plaintiffs contends that the first defendant did not register its name
as occupant and no order has been passed in favour of the first defendant that the land in question
vests with it under the Inams Abolition Act. For better appreciation of the case, it is necessary to
deal with certain provisions of the Inams Abolition Act.
48. Section 9 of the Inams Abolition Act deals with vesting of certain buildings and Inam lands used
for non-agricultural purposes. Sub-section (1) of Section 9 of the Act, every private building situated
within an inam shall with effect from the date of vesting, vest in the person who owned it
immediately before that date. Section 9(2) says that where an Inam land has been converted for any
purpose unconnected with agriculture, the holder of such land shall be entitled to keep the land
provided that such conversion was not void or illegal under any law in force. However, Sub-section
(3) of Section 9 says that the vesting of private buildings or lands under Sub-section (1) or (2) shall
be subject to the payment of non-agricultural assessment that may be imposed by Government from
time to time.
49. The learned Counsel for the plaintiffs has also further argued with reference to Section 11 of the
Inams Abolition Act that where before the date of vesting an inamdar has created, either by way of
lease or otherwise, any right in any inam land which vests in State other than the lands specified in
Clauses (a) and (c) of Sub-section (1) of Section 4, including rights in any forest mines or minerals,
quarries, fisheries or ferries, the transaction shall be deemed to be valid and all rights and
obligations arising there under on or after the date of vesting, shall be enforceable by or against the
Government.
50. At this stage, it is necessary to look into the provisions of Section 4(1) of the Inams Abolition Act,
which enables the registration of the Inamdar as occupants. As per Section 4(1)(c), every inamdar
shall, with effect from the date of vesting, be entitled to be registered as an occupant of all inam
lands other than lands upon which have been erected buildings owned by any person other than the
Inamdar.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131255/ 13Ranga Reddy Associates vs K. Shapoor Chenai And Ors. on 12 April, 2004
51. In view of the above provisions, the learned Counsel for the second plaintiff has argued that the
first defendant company should have registered as an occupant to claim the land as the asset of the
company. It is stated that as the first defendant has not registered its name, it cannot claim that the
land vests with it. The learned Counsel also submits that the Government issued G.O. Ms. No. 455
Revenue (U.C.I) Department dated 29.7.2002 fixing guidelines for allotment of excess land under
Section 23 of the Act which are already under occupation of third parties. In the said GO it is made
that on payment of the amounts prescribed for the excess land occupied and after such verification
and inspection as may be considered necessary, proposals for allotting the excess land in the name
of the occupier thereof shall be sent to Government and the third party occupants over the excess
land shall apply for allotment in the form shown in Schedule II to the said GO. But, in terms of the
said GO, the first defendant did not send any proposal claiming allotment of the excess land as an
occupier thereof. Non-applying for it would goes to show that it is not in occupation of the land in
question and it did not assert that the land in question is in its occupation. We find force in the said
contention.
52. The learned Counsel for the plaintiffs submits that the CCCAs are not maintainable in view of
the bar imposed under Section 96(c) of the CPC. As per Section 96(c) of the CPC, no appeal shall lie
from a decree passed by the Court with the consent of parties. The learned Counsel submits that
since these CCCAs have been filed questioning the compromise decree, the same have to be
dismissed.
53. On the other hand, the learned Counsel for the defendants submits that as on the date of passing
of compromise decree, the terms of the compromise which were entered in 1999 are not existing and
the first defendant has no power to transfer the property in view of the orders of the BIFR and the
said fact has been brought to the notice of the Court below, the Court below passed the decree and
hence the same is liable to be set aside.
54. Further, the Managing Director of the first defendant in his sworn statement recorded in the
compromise petition has stated that as per the original agreement in between them and the second
plaintiff and also as per the understanding reached, it is the second plaintiff who has to bear all the
expenses required in connection with the execution of any registered documents, obtaining
permission etc. He further stated that out of the total extent of 22 acres, the agreement in between
them and the second plaintiff is subject of 16 acres, which is cleared by ULC. Out of the 16 acres, the
rights in 6 acres is exclusively given to the second plaintiff. He also stated that they filed a
compromise memo and he has gone through the various terms and conditions of the said
compromise memo and they are correct. The Court below also observed that the true spirit of Order
23, Rule 3 reiterated the compromise has to be implemented unless there is a fraud. As no fraud has
been pleaded, the Court below acted upon the compromise particularly basing on recording of the
evidence of the Managing Director of the first defendant.
55. The learned Counsel for the appellant in CCCA No. 350 of 2003 has argued that though in the
body of the judgment it has been observed that Managing Director of the first defendant was
examined but in the appendix of the evidence to that judgment, it has been shown that none were
examined and hence the Trial Court hurriedly disposed of the matter without considering the facts.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131255/ 14Ranga Reddy Associates vs K. Shapoor Chenai And Ors. on 12 April, 2004
56. It is to be noted that the Managing Director of the first defendant was examined in the
Interlocutory Application No. 399 of 1999, which was filed requesting the Court to dispose of the
suit in terms of the compromise and hence in the appendix of evidence, the Trial Court mentioned
that none were examined. It is to be observed that the fact of deposition of the parties to the suit on
the compromise was recorded in the body of the decree which reads as follows:
"The compromise recorded by examining PW1, 2 and RW1 by IV Senior Civil Judge, CCC,
Hyderabad on 15.6.1999, which is part of compromise memo. Hence they are annexed to the
decree."
The above omission in the judgment even though recorded in the decree is only an omission. Even if
it is omitted in the appendix of evidence, it can be termed as irregularity which would not affect the
validity of the judgment in view of the above para.
57. From various orders of the BIFR and other authorities, no injunction has been granted by any of
the authorities against the company from alienating the subject-matter of the property. There is no
either injunction or prohibition. There is no order or any material is placed before this Court to
show that the land has become the asset of the company. The compromise which was reached
between the parties are within the parameters of the protected area declared by the competent
authority in its order dated 31.12.1993 i.e., Ex.B4.
58. The conduct of the appellant in CCCA No. 350 of 2003 i.e., first defendant in taking various
stands before various authorities and also the statement he has made in the affidavit filed in WP No.
10199 of 1999 i.e., Ex.A5 would go to show that he has agreed for the compromise and the conduct
of the first defendant which is evident from the orders of the various authorities extracted in earlier
paras and in the affidavit filed before the Supreme Court while withdrawing the SLP would go to
show that he is interested to enter into compromise. Having derived the benefit from the
compromise for nearly four years, the first defendant wants to question the judgment in the present
CCCA No. 350 of 2003 would show that he wants to approbate and reprobate of his own case and
evidence. It is to be seen that the first defendant enjoyed the benefits derived from the compromise
nearly for a period of four years. It is also to be observed that no material is placed before this Court
that the Civil Court has been apprised of all the orders of the authorities though ample time was
available to the defendants to apprise the same.
59. The learned Counsel for the second defendant placed reliance in support of his contention that
the Workers of a Company have locus to appear and to be heard in a winding up petition and he
placed reliance in the case of National Textile Worker's Union v. P.R. Ramakrishnan, . It is to be
seen that this is not a winding up petition and moreover the first defendant has undertaken to
protect the interests of the second defendant and if he had any grievance over the first defendant,
the second defendant as well can initiate separate proceedings against the first defendant and it can
not plead that the Court below should not act upon the petition filed for compromise particularly
when there is no whisper of fraud from anybody.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131255/ 15Ranga Reddy Associates vs K. Shapoor Chenai And Ors. on 12 April, 2004
60. Sri Veera Reddy, the learned Counsel appearing in CCCA No. 329 of 2003 submits that the
Courts cannot accept the proposal to sell the surplus land of a sick industry to another company and
clear the dues of the mortgagee bank and creditors, pay salaries of the workmen. The Counsel
submits that in the instant case, the Court acting on the compromise deed in which the first
defendant sick industry was permitted to transfer its land for consideration is bad since it goes
contrary to the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of State of W.B. v. Pronab Kumar Sur, ,
No doubt true that the Apex Court in the said judgment has found fault for accepting the sick
company's proposal to sell its surplus land to another company. But, in this case, it is not that the
land in question belongs to the first defendant in view of the fact that it is being continued in
possession on lease and hence it cannot be said that the terms of the compromise deed is contrary to
law and the said decision is not applicable to the facts of the case.
61. The Supreme Court in its latest Judgment in the case of C. and M.D. N.T.P.C. Limited v. R.C.
Builders and Contractors, , on the principle that one who knowingly accepts the benefits of a
contract or conveyance is estopped to deny the validity or binding effect on him of such contract, at
para 36 and 37 extracted the following passages from Halsbury's laws and American Jurisprudence:
"In Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th Edition Vol.16 (Reissue) para 957 at page 844 it is stated:
On the principle that a person may not approbate and reprobate a special species of estoppel has
arisen. The principle that a person may not approbate and reprobate express two propositions:
(1) That the person in question, having a choice between two courses of conduct is to be treated as
having made an election from which he cannot resile.
(2) That he will be regarded, in general at any rate, as having so elected unless he has taken a benefit
under or arising out of the course of conduct, which he has first pursued and with which his
subsequent conduct is inconsistent."
37. In American Jurisprudence, 2nd Edition, Volume 28, 1966 page 677-680 it is stated:
"Estoppel by the acceptance of benefits:
Estoppel is frequently based upon the acceptance and retention, by one having knowledge or notice
of the facts, of benefits from a transaction, contract, instrument, regulation which he might have
rejected or contested. This doctrine is obviously a branch of the rule against assuming inconsistent
positions.
As a general principle, one who knowingly accepts the benefits of a contract or conveyance is
estopped to deny the validity or binding effect on him of such contract or conveyance.
This rule has to be applied to do equity and must not be applied in such a manner as to violate the
principles of right and good conscience.

xxxx xxxxx xxxxxx"
62. In the case of R.N. Gosain v. Yashpal Dhir, 1992 AIR SCW 3337, the Apex Court has held that a
person cannot be permitted to say at one time that a transaction is valid and thereby obtain some
advantage, to which he could only be entitled on the footing that it is valid and then turn round and
say it is void for the purpose of securing some other advantage.
63. In this case also, the defendants having obtained some advantage by entering into compromise
with the plaintiffs, they cannot turn round and say that such compromise, agreement is void.
64. The learned Counsel for the second plaintiff placed reliance on the judgment of the Supreme
Court in the case of Shree Chamundi Mopeds Ltd. v. Church of S.I.T. Assocn, , in support of his
contention that suspension of legal proceedings against a sick industrial company under Section
22(1) of the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act does not cover a proceedings
instituted by a landlord of a sick industrial company for the eviction of the company from premises
let out to it. Hence, merely because the proceedings against the first defendant are pending, it does
not prevent the landlord to initiate eviction proceedings and therefore the contention of the
Defendant No. 1 that the eviction proceedings does not lie has no force.
65. In support of the contention of the learned Counsel for the second plaintiffs that where State has
not taken possession after issuing vesting order, it shall be deemed that the landowner does have the
right to seek exemption, he placed reliance in the case of Special Officer and Competent Authority,
ULC v. P.S. Rao, .
66. The Delhi High Court in the case of Krishan Mohan Singh v. Sri Chand Gupta, , it has been held
that statement made by the parties and recorded in Court's proceedings and signed by parties and
their Counsel would constitute written instrument of compromise as contemplated under Order 23,
Rule 3 of CPC. It has also been held that the proceedings recorded in Court signed by the parties is
also called instrument. In this case, the defendants entered into compromise with the plaintiffs and
derived the benefit from the second plaintiff and the first defendant's Managing Director has given
statement on oath in the Court about the fact of entering into compromise and hence the
compromise and sworn statement are binding on the parties to the suit and the Court below rightly
acted on those instruments while passing the decree of compromise.
67. The Supreme Court in the case of Byram Pestonji Gariwala v. Union Bank of India, , has held
that a compromise decree if not vitiated by fraud, misrepresentation, misunderstanding or mistake
is binding and operates as res judicata as also estoppel between the parties. In the said judgment, it
has also been held that a judgment by consent is intended to stop litigation between the parties just
as much as a judgment resulting from a decision of the Court at the end of a long drawn out fight
and a compromise decree creates an estoppel by judgment. In the appeals filed by Defendants 1 and
2, the judgment is passed basing on the terms of compromise entered into between the plaintiffs and
Defendants 1 and 2 and hence the said judgment is binding on them.

68. The learned Counsel Sri Subba Reddy appearing for Sri M.S. Ramachandra Rao placed reliance
in the case of Roshan Lal v. Madan Lal, , in support of his contention that while recording a
compromise decree duty cast on the Court is to see whether the compromise is in violation of the
requirement of the law. In these cases, as held above, no infringement of any law has been made out
by the defendants, particularly, in view of the fact that they failed to produce any injunction or order
from any authority restraining the alienation of the property in question. In the absence of such
orders, it cannot be held that recording of compromise does not violate the requirements of the law.
69. The learned Counsel Sri Subba Reddy placed reliance in the case of Dr. Sunil Kumar v.
Amolaksing (Died Per LRs), , in support of his contention that an appeal can be laid even against the
compromise decree under Order 43, Rule 1(A) (2) of the CPC. A learned Single Judge of this Court
observed that the Apex Court in an attempt to reconcile the provision of Section 96(3) and Sub-rule
(2) of Rule 1(A) of Order 43, has categorically held that inasmuch as the amended provisions of the
Code took away the right of appeal and even the right to challenge the compromise decree and as the
parties are left without any remedy to challenge the compromise decree, Rule 1(A)(2) of Order 43
has been incorporated, so as to enable the parties to question the validity of compromise by
preferring an appeal against the decree. In the said case, the learned Judge has held that since Ex.A1
in that suit is in dispute, the appeal is maintainable even though it is a compromise one. But, in the
instant case, entering into compromise is not disputed and executing the said compromise deed and
the terms therein are also not in dispute and hence appeals, in the facts and circumstances of the
present case, are not maintainable.
70. The learned Counsel Sri Subba Reddy also relied on a Division Bench Judgment of this Court in
the case of Board of Education of Samavesham of TEC, Nellore v. State of A.P., (DB), in support of
his contention, that no consent order can be passed contrary to the public policy or constitutional
provisions. In this case, no material has been placed to show that the said compromise has affected
the public policy or constitutional provisions. In the earlier paras, we held that by entering into such
compromise, it did not affect the public policy or they reached the agreement contrary to the
provisions of law. Therefore, the said decision is not applicable to the facts of the case.
71. In the impugned judgment, the Court below has recorded the submission of the learned Counsel
for the first defendant that the Counsel for the first defendant has orally opposed the compromise
stating that the delay caused financial drain to him and now wants to have a fresh compromise
taking the matter to the arbitration. The appellants have not chosen to file affidavit of the learned
Counsel. But, in view of Order 23, Rule 3 of CPC that once compromise takes place it has to be
implemented unless there is a fraud. Since the allegation of fraud has not been attributed to the
plaintiffs and considering the fact that the first defendant enjoyed the benefit, the opposition made
by the first defendant to the compromise cannot be accepted. The Court below by taking all these
factors into consideration decreed the suit in terms of compromise which they filed in IA No. 399 of
1999.
72. Finally, it is the arguments of the appellants that the plaintiffs did not pay the Court fee and
hence the judgment and decree cannot be passed. It is true that in the decree itself, the Trial Court
with regard to payment of Court fee held as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131255/ 18Ranga Reddy Associates vs K. Shapoor Chenai And Ors. on 12 April, 2004
"It is hereby directed to pay the Court fee if any required to pay."
Therefore, it goes to show that the said judgment will have the binding effect only on payment of the
Court fee. As the Trial Court in its decree did not assess the value of the property relating to
compromise and payment of Court fee thereon, the matter is remanded to the Trial Court with a
direction to assess the value of the property relating to compromise and the Court fee payable
thereon within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. On such
assessment, the respective parties are directed to pay the same within a period of two months
thereafter in the Court below.
73. For the foregoing discussion, this Court does not find any reason to set aside the said decree and
judgment in OS No. 69 of 2003 on the file of the XIII Additional Chief Judge, CCC (FTC),
Hyderabad. Accordingly, CCCA Nos. 350 of 2003 and 74 of 2004 are dismissed.
74. Since in the earlier paras, we have taken a view that the appellants in CCCA No. 329 of 2003 and
CCCA Sr. No. CCCA 131/04 of 2003 are not the affected parties much less they are not parties to the
suit and they have no locus standi to question the said judgment and decree. Therefore, these
appeals are liable to be dismissed and they are also dismissed accordingly. No costs.
75. In view of dismissal of CCCA No. 329 of 2003, no orders need be passed in the review petitions
filed by the plaintiffs and hence those review petitions have been closed.
