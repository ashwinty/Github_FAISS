3. Ground No.4 is consequential.
4. Ground No.5 is premature, which needs no adjudication.
Asst. Year 2006-07
5. Ground No.6 is general in nature which needs no adjudication.
6. Ground nos. 2 is related to inadmissibility of deduction u/s 80IB(10) of the Act at
Rs.1,32,19,672/-.
7. Ground no.3 is against disallowing of deduction u/s 80IB(10)of the Act for surrender made on
account of undisclosed income (on money found during search proceedings) at Rs.2,34,39,999/-.
8. Ground Nos. 2 & 3 are inter related so thay are taken together for disposal.
9. Briefly stated facts as culled out from the available record are that the assessee firm is engaged in
the business of development and construction of residential houses. The assessee filed its return of
income for Asst. Year 2006-07 under the provisions of section 139(1) of the Act on 18.12.2006
declaring total income of Rs.29,230/- (i.e. after claiming deduction of Rs.1,32,19,672/- u/s 80IB(10)
of the Act). Scrutiny assessment was completed u/s 143(3) of the Act on 4.2.2008 and the income
was assessed as per the income returned.
10. Thereafter a search action u/s 132 of the Act was carried out in the case of Galaxi group on
21.7.2011. The entire group Asst. Year 2006-07 consists of 4 sub-groups as mainly engaged in the
business of construction and real estate. The case of the assessee belongs to Madhav Group. Search
and seizure u/s 132 of the Act/survey u/s 133A of the Act were carried out at the residential as well
as business premises of assessee as well as its partners. During the course of search proceedings as
well as post search proceedings various incriminating materials relating to various firms of assessee
group i.e. Madhav group were found and seized. Based on the seized material, the main persons of
the assessee group Shri Motibhai Revabhai Prajapati, Shri Kantibhai R. Prajapati and Shri
Bhagwanbhai R. Prajapati admitted undisclosed income relating to firm /group concern of Madhav
group and also specified the manner in which such income has been derived.

11. Pursuant to search action u/s 132 of the Act proceedings u/s 153 were initiated by issuance of
notice on 11.1.2012. In response to the notice assessee filed the return of income for Asst. Year
2006-07 on 9.2.1012 declaring total income of Rs.29,277/- after claiming deduction u/s 80IB(10) of
the Act at Rs.3,66,59,672/-. The assessee claimed deduction u/s 80IB(10) of the Act for normal
profits from business as developer at Rs.1,32,19,672/- as shown in original return of income and
also claimed deduction u/s 80IB(10) of the Act for Rs.2,34,39,999/- on account of undisclosed
income surrendered in the return of income pursuant to search action u/s 132 of the Act.
Asst. Year 2006-07
12. During the course of assessment proceedings various replies and submissions were submitted by
the assessee in support of its claim for deduction u/s 80IB(10) of the Act but Assessing Officer was
not convinced by submissions of assessee on account of following reasons as mentioned in
assessment order:-
"5.23 It is therefore held that the assessee is not eligible for deduction under section 80IB for the
following reasons:-
1. The assessee is not both developer and builder as required by the provisions of section 80IB(10).
Assessee is not a developer because the assessee did not conceptualise and own the project in as
much as the assessee is not the owner of the land and the approval was not issued to it by the local
authority.
2. The assessee entered into the project by way of tripartite agreement executed between the
members. Shree Madhav Co-op. Housing Society Ltd. and the assessee firm and the construction
work was done in accordance with such tripartite agreement. Hence the assessee is merely a
contractor for the purposes of construction of the project.
3. The assessee has not sold any unit to the purchaser but the society has executed the sale deeds as
a seller and the assessee joined only as a confirming party to the transaction. This also proves that
the assessee was merely a contractor/agent of the society.
4. As per the amendment to section 80IB by the Finance Act 2009 a work contractor who executes
the work awarded by any person is not eligible for the deduction u/s 80IB. Any person includes
Shree Madhav Co-op. Housing Society Ltd., which is a legal entity."
Asst. Year 2006-07 On account of above reasons Assessing Officer denied the deduction u/s
80IB(10) of the Act as claimed by the assessee in its original return of income at Rs.1,32,19,672/-
and also denied the deduction for the enhanced claim of deduction at Rs.2,34,39,999/- claimed by
the assessee in the return filed in pursuance of notice u/s 153A of the Act. Accordingly income of the
assessee was assessed at Rs.3,66,88,899/-.
13. Aggrieved, assessee went in appeal before CIT(A) However, ld. CIT(A) confirmed the addition
made by the Assessing Officer dismissing the appeal of the assessee by observing in respect of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83153580/ 3Madhav Builders, , Ahmedabad vs Assessee on 1 February, 2016
ground nos.2 & 3 as under:-
Regarding ground no.2 "6. I have gone through the assessment order and submission of the A.R. of
the appellant carefully. It is important to note here that the claim u/s 80IB of the I.T. Act, 1961 by
another firm of the appellant's group (Madhav Group) i.e. Madhav Corporation for AYs. 2006-07,
2007-08 and 2008-09 has also been rejected by the Assessing Officer. In that firm in AY 2007-08
even during original assessment u/s 143(3) of the IT Act, 1961 the claim u/s 80IB of the IT Act, 1961
was rejected for detailed reasons proving that the appellant firm is a contractor and not the
developer. That order was confirmed by the CIT(A)-XV, Ahmedabad vide order in Appeal
No.CIT(A)-XV/ITO/9(2)/266/09-10 dated 7.1.2011. The firm of the appellant group has gone to
ITAT, Ahmedabad against the above mentioned order of CIT(A). The case is still pending before the
ITAT for adjudication.
6.1 The appellant is the firm of the same group to which M/s Madhav Corporation belongs. The
main working partners are the same in both the firms i.e. Shri Motibhai Revabhai Prajapati and Shri
Kantibhai Revabhai Prajapati. The modus operandi and nature of work is also exactly the same.
6.2 The appellant filed his submission with exactly the same defence as was produced before the
Assessing Officer. In his submission he relied on the decision of Gujarat High Court in the case of
Radhe Developers and M/s Shakti Corporation In view of this and in absence of any additional
material against the decision of CIT(A) Asst. Year 2006-07 except relying on the judgment by the
judicial authorities in case of M/s Radhe Developers/Shakti Corporation, I am of the view that no
interference is called for in the matter. As far as applicability of decision in case of M/s Radhe
Developers, in appellant's case is concerned, the matter is already pending before ITAT in Madhav
Corporation, a firm of appellant's own group for the AY 2007-08. In this situation at the moment,
without going into merits of the case, I find it proper not to differ from the order passed by
CIT(A)-XV, Ahmedabad in the case of Madhav Corporation. Accordingly, to maintain consistency,
subject to outcome of the decision of ITAT, Ahmedabad, in case of Madhav Corporation, AY
2007-08 on the exactly similar issue, the appeal is dismissed."
Regarding ground no.3 "8. I have gone through the assessment order and submission of the A.R. of
the appellant carefully. This ground is against the disallowance of Rs.2,34,39,999/-, the additional
income shown by the appellant in the block return and claimed to be exempt u/s.80lB of the I.T.
Act, 1961. This income is calculated by the appellant based on the seized material (page No.7 of
annexure A/7 -party no.21). The Assessing Officer disallowed this claim firstly because the entire
project is treated as ineligible for claim u/s.80IB of the I.T. Act. 1961. Secondly, the Assessing
Officer has disallowed .this amount as the same does not fulfill the conditions laid down in Section
80IA(5) and 80IA(7) of the IT. Act, 1961 which are applicable to Section 80!B of the IT, Act, 1961
also. The provision of Section 80IA(7) reads as under:
"(7) The deduction under nub-section (I) from profits, and gains derived from an
undertaking shall not be admissible unless the accounts of the undertaking for the
previous year relevant to the assessment year for which the deduction is claimed have
been audited by an accountant, as defined in the Explanation below sub-section (2) of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83153580/ 4Madhav Builders, , Ahmedabad vs Assessee on 1 February, 2016
section 288, and she assessee furnishes, along with his return of income, the report of
such audit in the prescribed form duly signed and verified by such accountant."
8.1 As the section 80IA(5) and 80IA(7) are very clear the additional income which is not shown in
the regular books of accounts cannot be considered for the purpose of deduction u/s.80lB(10) of the
I.T. Act, 1961. The books of account on this basis of which the Assessing Officer filed his return of
income and was assessed u/s. 143(3) of the I.T. Act, 1961 do not contain this income of the
appellant. This income is added to the appellant's income only subsequent to the search. As the
income is not part of the regular books as per prevision of section 801A(5) and 801A(7) of the I.T.
Act, 1961 are applicable and claim u/s.80IB(10) of the I.T. Act, 1961 is not admissible on this
additional income of the appellant.
8.2. The Assessing Officer has also rightly applied the provisions of section 80IA10) for the following
reasons:
Asst. Year 2006-07
i) The assessee firm is closely connected with the partners and close relatives have provided funds
uniformly for purchase of land by the Society.
• The arrangement made by the assessee for development is such that no profit whatsoever is passed
to the Society, though it is the real owner of the land.
• This arrangement has actually resulted in abnormally high profits in the assessee's hand which has
been orchestrated to claim higher deduction.
• The additional income offered on account of on-money received has been included in the income
of the assesses with the intention of claiming higher than due deduction u/s, 80lB(10) of the Act.
Hence, in view of provisions of section 80IA (5) and 80IA (7) and also 80lA(10) of the I.T, Act. 1961,
the additional income of the appellant cannot be treated as income eligible for the deduction u/s.
80lB (10) of the I T Act. 1961.
8.3 In view of above discussion, the disallowance of Rs.2,34,39,999/- is confirmed, the appeal on
this ground is dismissed."
14. Aggrieved assessee is now in appeal before the Tribunal. ld. AR submitted that -
i) During the course of assessment proceedings the Assessing Officer called for details of assessee's
claim for deduction u/s 80IB(10) of the Act of Rs.3,66,59,672/- attributable to housing project. The
assessee submitted exhaustive details. However, the Assessing Officer disallowed assessee's claim
u/s 80IB(10) of the Act, having treated the undisclosed profit as "income from other sources."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83153580/ 5Madhav Builders, , Ahmedabad vs Assessee on 1 February, 2016
ii) That the assessee firm has built and developed the housing project within the meaning of
sec.80IB(10) of the Act, on land survey No.1943 F.P. No.64 situated at village Vastral, Ta.Dist.
Ahmedabad. The total area of land was 38,365 sq.mtrs. The assessee firm built and developed the
housing project namely "Madhav Bunglows" (Madhav Co-op. Housing Society Ltd.). For
commencement of such project, permission (Rajachithi) was issued on 3/12/2004 by the local
authority, as per copy of such documents furnished before the AO. As per the plan submitted by the
firm and Rajachitthi granted by the local authority, there are 204 residential units and one water
tank plus one electrical Asst. Year 2006-07 substation. The project completed on 29/06/2006,
corresponding to AY 2007-08.
iii) As may be perused from the records of the AO the assessee firm claimed the legitimate deduction
u/s 80IB(10) in the original return of income for AY 2004-05 to AY 2006-07, claiming deduction
u/s 80IB(10) of the Act which have been allowed by the department in the scrutiny assessments
framed u/s 143(3) of the Act, as per particulars below :-
A.Y. Amount claimed u/s Amount allowed by Sec. of Date of
8018(10) . the A.O. (Rs.) assessment assessment
(RS.) order order
2004-05 75,72,250/- 75,72,2507- 143(3) 28/0372006
2005-06 1,66,40,8187- 1,66,40,8187- 143(3) 06/0772007
2006-07 1,32,19,6727- 1,32,19,6727- 143(3) 04702/2008
From the above, it may be appreciated that the department having scrutinized the claim of the
assessee and allowed as such in the aforesaid years, however, in absence of any change in facts
and/or circumstances of the case, there is no justification in rejecting the claim of the assessee firm
in the subsequent proceedings u/s 143(3) r.w.s. 153A of the Act for A.Y. 2006-07.
iv) Further It is respectfully submitted that consequent to search u/s 132 of the Act at the business
premises of the assessee, certain documents/papers were seized by the department on the basis of
which, the assessee firm, has arrived at the undisclosed profit from the referred project [which
fulfills the criteria of legitimate deductions u/s 8016(10) of the Act] to the tune of Rs. 2,34,39,999/-
As per copy profit & loss account and balance-sheet placed on record, cumulatively the total claim of
legitimate deduction u/s 80IB(10) on the basis of seized papers and regular books of accounts for
the whole project worked out as under:- -
As per seized paper annexed Al/7: Rs. 2,34,39,999/-
Add as per regular books of Accounts Rs. 1.32.19.672/-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83153580/ 6Madhav Builders, , Ahmedabad vs Assessee on 1 February, 2016
as claimed and allowed in Asst. Year 2006-07 original assessment order u/s 143(3) dated
04/02/2008.
Total claim made in block return Rs. 3,66,59,671/-
v) Further to substantiate, it claims, the assessee firm has submitted required documents i.e. copy of
plans, copy of commencement of permission, B.U. permission along with requisite audit report,
during the course of ssessment proceedings. The project was approved on 03/12/2004, the same
has been completed on 29/06/2006, the size of plot on which the housing project was floated by the
assessee firm, is 38,365 sq.mts. which exceed area of 1 acre, the residential unit of the project did
not exceed the prescribed limit of 1500 sq.feet of built up area.
Thus, the basic conditions of claiming the legitimate deduction u/s 80IB(10) are duly-fulfilled.
15. As regards assessee's claim of deduction u/s 8OIB(10) on additional income referable to seized
material ld. AR submitted that
(i) The original claim of deduction u/s 80IB(10) of Rs. 1,32,19,672/- has been enhanced by the
Rs.2,34,39,999/- as worked out on the basis of details placed on record and the assessee's claim of
additional profit has been based on seized document.
(ii) According to Ld. CIT(A), the entire project is treated as ineligible for claim u/s 8016(10) of the
Act, simply following the views of the A.O. without giving his own independent findings. Secondly,
he has noted that as per A.O. the claim does not fulfill the conditions laid down in Sec. 80!A(5) and
80IA(7) of the Act. On that basis, the Ld. CIT(A) has concluded that the additional income which is
not shown in the regular books of accounts, cannot be considered for the purpose of deduction u/s
8016(10) of the Act and he has confirmed the disallowance of Rs.2,34,39,999/-.
(iii) As aforesaid, in the assessee's own case, the claim of the assessee made u/s 801B(10) of the Act,
has been considered being in order and within the parameters of relevant provisions of the Act in
the completed assessments in the past i.e. A.Y. 2004-05 to 2006- 07 [as submitted in Para
4(iii)above].
Asst. Year 2006-07
(iv) Having regard to the aforesaid order, the issue involved in the assessee's case for the year under
appeal is exactly identical. When the facts are identical, the revenue department is expected to adopt
a consistent approach in finalization of the assessment, as per the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble
Apex Court in RADHASWAMI SATSANG Vs. COMMISSIONER OF INCOME-
TAX [1992] 193 ITR 321 (SC). Otherwise also it is not open to the revenue department to keep on
changing its stands, in respect of the same nature of transaction, without just cause [Berger Paints
India Ltd.266 ITR 99 (SC)]. It therefore, flows that if an income is exempt either u/s. 2(14), 10 or
otherwise, due effect of the same has to be given while framing the assessment.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83153580/ 7Madhav Builders, , Ahmedabad vs Assessee on 1 February, 2016
(v) In the light of the facts as narrated above, it emerges from the records that the disclosed income
attributable to 'on-money' has been duly offered for taxation in the form of enhanced profit while
computing taxable income in the year under consideration. Meaning thereby undisclosed income
was, in fact, received in the normal course. However, on one hand the undisclosed income is taxed;
whereas Iegitimate deduction is disallowed. The departmental authorities have taken different
stand. This is contrary to the intention of the legislature and against the letter and spirit of the
beneficial provisions of the Act.
16. Further the ld. AR submitted that the issue stands settled in the assessee's own case by virtue of
order passed by the Hon'ble Guiarat High Court in the assessee's case for assessment year for A.Y.
2004-05 was framed u/s 143(3) of the Act on 28/03/2006. Subsequently, by notice dated
17/03/2011, the assessment was reopened by the department. The assessee challenged the notice
before the Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in S.C.A. No.17304 of 2011. Thereby Hon'ble High Court vide
its order dated 27/12/2011 has quashed the notice u/s 148 and also consequential order of
assessment passed pursuant thereto, While disposing of the Writ, the Hon'ble High Court has
reasoned as under-
Asst. Year 2006-07 "10. It can be noted from the record that for the assessment year 2004-05, as
mentioned hereinabove, on 28/03/2006, the assessment in the case of the present petitioner is
finalized u/s 143(3) of the Income Tax Act after allowing deduction of Rs, 75,72,250/~ u/s 80IB(10)
of the Act. It can be noted that specific query was raised issuing the notice u/s 142(1) dated
10/02/2006, which had been replied to by the present petitioner stating therein that they are into
the business of infrastructure, construction and doing business of construction of residential houses
for the common man with further detail that firm had carried out the construction activity at the
market value worth Rs.3.36 crores (rounded off). It appears that in the final assessment order,
which was passed on 28/03/2006, it was noted that the assessee's firm is in the business of
construction of housing project and it carried out the construction of housing project for and on
behalf of M/s Madhav Co-operative Housing Society Limited. In the computation of income the
deduction u/s 80IB(10) to the tune of Rs.75,72,250/- had been permitted. Thus, it can be seen that
after raising specific query and on getting reply and after duly considering the same, the assessment
order had been passed. This fact also is not being disputed by the respondent."
"14. As is mentioned hereinabove, this identical issue already has been discussed and this question
has been held in favour of the assessee and in the present case also the petitioner being the works
contractor should be availed the benefit of deduction u/s 80IB(10) of the Act and notice of
reopening requires to be quashed."
Ld. AR further submitted that without prejudice to the about it is respectfully submitted that
incidentally, recently Hon'ble ITAT Ahmedabad 'B' Bench, Ahmedabad had an occasion to consider
allow-ability of claim of deduction u/s 54B of the Act against Capital Gain taxation on the "On
money components" in the case of one of the partners of the firm namely ShriBhagwanbhai R.
Prajapati in IT(SS) Appeal No. 377/Ahd/2014. The relevant ground of appeal raised in the case of
Bhagwanbhai R. Prajapati reads as under.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83153580/ 8Madhav Builders, , Ahmedabad vs Assessee on 1 February, 2016
Asst. Year 2006-07 "On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Ld. Commissioner of
Income Tax (Appeals)-I, Ahmedabad, had grossly erred in aliowing the legitimate exemption u/s.
54B to the extent of Rs. 39,38,100/-being the sale consideration received as per registered sale deed
only. She has not allowed the legitimate deduction u/s.54B on the von money' received on sale of
agriculture land. The same may kindly be directed to be allowed legitimate deduction of
Rs.92,47,100/- claimed u/s.54B on full sale consideration i.e. as per 'registered sale deed' von
money' received on sale of said agriculture land."
The Co-ordinated Bench, in the case of Bhagwanbhai R. Prajapati held that beneficial provisions
play in their own sphere and they are meant for benefit of the tax payers and observed as under :-
"6,2 Regarding al/owability of claim of claim of "On-money" the Ld. AR drew our
attention to the decision of Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in the case of CIT vs. Suman
Paper & Boards Ltd. (2009) 221 CTR 0781 wherein it was held that in view of
amendment on the provisions of section 158BB by the Finance Act, 2002 with
retrospective effect from 1st July, 1995 the assessee was entitled to claim deduction
under sec. 80-1 or section 80-IA in block assessment of the block period. The
Revenue has acknowledged the benefit of deduction with regard to undisclosed
Income of the block period.
6.3 In the case before us the issue is with regards to the benefit of exemption under
section 54B with regard to the on money. Both are beneficial provisions in their own
spheres so drawing the same analogy, we are of the view that assessee is entitled for
getting benefit of exemption u/s 54B with regard to the 'On money'. This view is
fortified by decision of Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of CIT vs. Sheth
Developers (P) LTD. in ITA No. 3724 of 2010, wherein it was held that assessee was
entitled to the benefit of Sec. 80IB and accordingly directed the A.O. to recomputed
the tax payable for the block period 1.4.1995 to 21.2.2002 u/s 185BB after giving
benefit of Sec. 80IB.Thus it was held that for block period assessee was entitled to
claim deduction in its income under section 80IB,"
Asst. Year 2006-07 In view of above decision, we hold that the assessee is entitled in claiming
exemption on total income including on money. The Assessing Officer is directed accordingly.
Since, the issue involved in the case on hand, being the same and having bearing on the identical
facts, by virtue of Hon'ble Tribunal's order (Supra) as well as by virtue of Hon'ble Gujarat High
Court's order dated 27/12/2011 the issue involved in the case of the appellant is squarely
"COVERED MATTER".
Ld. AR further submitted that incidentally, recently Hon'ble ITAT 'D' Bench Ahmedabad had an
occasion to consider allowability of claim of deduction u/s 80IB(10) of the Act, against additional
income on the "On money components" in the case of appellant's associated concerns namely M/s
Madhav Corporatton vs. ACIT in ITCSS)A Nos. 380 to 382/AHD/2014(order dated 28/07/2015)
The relevant ground of appeal raised in the referred case reads as under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83153580/ 9Madhav Builders, , Ahmedabad vs Assessee on 1 February, 2016
Ground No.4 "On facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Ld. CIT(A)-1, Ahmedabad, has
grossly erred in confirming the addition of Rs. 2,75,00,000/- reflected in seized documents by
considering it as not related to profit of the Housing project. Though the same is forming part of
total profit of the Housing project and therefore, the same may kindly be considered as part of profit
of the Housing Project. The same may kindly be directed to consider as part of profit of the Housing
Project and be allowed as deduction u/s 80IB(10) of the Act."
The relevant ground of appeal raised in the case of the present - appellant reads as under:-
Asst. Year 2006-07 "On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Ld. Commissioner of
Income Tax (Appeals)-I, Ahmedabad, has grossly erred confirming addition of Rs,2,34,39,999/-
being additionally claimed u/s80IB(10) on the basis of seized records. The same may kindly be
allowed on such legitimate claim."
The Co-ordinated Bench in the case of M/s Madhav Corporation (Supra) has allowed the assessee's
ground raised as above holding that the assessee is eligible for deduction u/s 80IB(10) of the Act in
respect of undisclosed income assessed by the A.O. in accordance with the return filed by the
assessee u/s 153A of the Act, in response to notice u/s 153A of the Act issued by the department. The
relevant portion of the order dated 28/07/2015 is reproduced as under:-
Para. 5.3 "Even otherwise based on the rule of consistency if the eligible project undertaken remains
the same and the conditions are satisfied and if deduction is allowable in the first assessment year
(which is A.Y. 2006-07 in the assessee's case) then the same has to be allowed in the subsequent
assessment years. We find that coordinate "D" bench of Tribunal in ITA No. 496/Ahd/2011 A.Y.
2007-08 in the case of Golden Developers Vs. ITO(OSD), Range-9, Ahmedabad dated 13/11/2014, it
was held that in case the applicant is entitled for claim of deduction u/s 80IB(10) in A.Y.2006-07
then the appellant is also eligible for the said in A.Ys. 2007- 08 & 2008-09.
Following same reasoning, we hold that the assessee on this additional income of Rs. 85,66,22s/- for
A.Y. 2008-09 is entitled for claiming deduction u/s 80IB(10) of the Act as discussed above.
Assessing Officer is directed accordingly,"
In the case on hand, the claim u/s 80IB(10) of the Act was originally allowed in A.Ys. 2004-05,
2005-06 & 2006-07 by passing the assessment orders u/s 143(3) of the Act dated 28/03/2006,
06/07/2007 & 04/02/2008 respectively. Therefore, the deduction of Rs. 1,32,19,672/-originally
allowed in A.Y. 2006-07, cannot be disallowed again but is allowable for the same assessment year
under appeal i.e. A.Y. 2006-07 as per the binding decisions of two Coordinated Benches (Supra) as
per -Ground No.2 of the appeal. In support of this, contention copies of original* Asst. Year 2006-07
assessment orders passed u/s 143(3) for A.Ys. 2004-5, 2005-06 & 2006- 07 are enclosed."
17. The DR vehemently supported the orders of the lower authorities.
18. We have heard the rival contentions and perused the material on record and referred to various
decisions relied upon. The issue in this appeal revolves round the admissibility of deduction u/s
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83153580/ 10Madhav Builders, , Ahmedabad vs Assessee on 1 February, 2016
80IB(10) of the Act for the claim made at the time of filing original return of income at
Rs.1,32,19,672/- and additional claim of deduction u/s 80IB(10) of the Act at Rs.2,34,39,999/- for
the income surrendered during search proceedings on the basis of indiscriminating material found
and seized and the same being surrendered in the return of income filed in pursuance to notice u/s
153A(1) of the Act.
19. Before going further to examine the facts of the case let us go through the provisions of section
80IB(10) of the Act which reads as follows :-
Sec.80IB[(10) The amount of deduction in the case of an undertaking developing and building
housing projects approved before the 31st day of March, [2008] by a local authority shall be

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83153580/ 11Madhav Builders, , Ahmedabad vs Assessee on 1 February, 2016
the municipal limits of these cities and one thousand and five hundred square feet at any other

project is allotted to any person not being an individual; and
(f) in a case where a residential unit in the housing project is allotted to a person being an

doubts, it is hereby declared that nothing contained in this sub-section shall apply to any
undertaking which executes the housing project as a works contract awarded by any person
(including the Central or State Government).] Asst. Year 2006-07 From going through the
provisions of section 80IB(10) of the Act, submissions made by the assessee before the lower
authorities, observations made by the Assessing Officer and findings of ld. CIT(A), following matters
need to be analyzed in the present case-
(1) Whether the assessee is a developer or a works contractor; (2) Whether the
assessee fulfills all the conditions of section 80IB(10) of the Act other than the
matters mentioned at point (1) above;
(3) Whether it is a pre-condition for claiming exemption u/s 80IB(10) of the Act that
the developer owns the land on which the housing project has been constructed;
(4) Whether the assessee is eligible to claim deduction u/s 80IB(10) of the Act for the
undisclosed income surrendered during search/survey action in a situation when
assessee has been assessed in previous years and has been allowed the deduction u/s
80IB(10) of the Act.
20. We will now analyze the above matters one by one to arrive at the decision. The most crucial
issue is -
(1) Whether the assessee is a developer or a works
contractor
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83153580/ 12Madhav Builders, , Ahmedabad vs Assessee on 1 February, 2016
With retrospective amendment which came in force by Finance Act 2009 effective from 1.4.2001
whereby to remove the doubts it was declared that the provisions of section 80IB(10) shall not apply
to any undertaking which executes housing project as an works contractor. In other words if an
assessee is a developer and not a works contractor then only he will be eligible for deduction u/s
80IB(10) of the Act. During the course of hearing ld. AR has Asst. Year 2006-07 submitted that the
assessee firm in the capacity as a developer has built and developed the housing project on land
survey No.1043 F.P.64 situated at village Vastral, Ta. Dist. Ahmedabad. The total area of the land
was 38,365 sq.meters and the housing project in the name of Madhav Bungalows was developed.
Permission for commencement of this project was issued on 30.12.2004 to Madhav Co-op. Housing
Society Ltd. as the land was owned by Madhav Co-op. Housing Society Ltd. As per this plan 204
residential units, one water tank and electrical sub-station were to be developed. Before receiving
the permission on 3.12.2004, a development agreement dated 27.8.2003 was entered into between
the land owner Madhav Co-op. Housing Society Ltd. and developer Madhav Builders i.e. the
assessee. The assessee firm has been claiming legitimate deduction u/s 80IB(10) of the Act for Asst.
Year 2004-05 to Asst. Year 2005-06. Ld. AR submitted that assessee has been working in the
capacity of a developer and not as a works contractor.
21. On the other hand, ld. DR referred to the decision of Hon'ble Jurisdictional High Court dated
27.12.2011 in assessee's own case in Special Civil Application 17304 of 20011 wherein their
Lordships Have observed as under :-
"13. We also had occasion to deal with the similar question in Special Civil Application No. 15966 of
2011 in the case of Pravinkumar Bhogilal Shah vs. Income Tax Officer (OSD) and following other
decisions of this Court, the issue has been held in favour of the assessee. It needs to be noted that
prior to the amendment, which had to be given retrospective effect, there was no distinction
between the term "developer" and "works contract". All that was required of the assessee had been
Asst. Year 2006-07 disclosed and this was pursuant to the amendment brought in by the statute
with effect from 1.4.2001. There has been denial of benefit under Section 80IB(10) to the works
contractor executing the housing project and, therefore, it would not be feasible for any person to
contemplate any such retrospective amendment and disclose in the return, which was otherwise not
required. As can be seen from the assessment order as well as from the record that has been placed
before the Court that the petitioner had disclosed all the material facts which were necessary for the
purpose of assessment and as the notice under challenge is issued on expiry of the period of 4 years
from the end of the relevant year of assessment under consideration, there is nothing to indicate nor
anything to establish that the assessee has not disclosed fully and truly all material facts. The very
edifice to the impugned notice is not to be held sustainable.
14. As is mentioned hereinabove, this identical issue already has been discussed and this question
has been held in favour of the assessee and in the present case also the petitioner being the works
contractor should be availed the benefit of deduction under Section 80IB(10) of the Act and notice
of reopening requires to be quashed. As mentioned earlier since there was no time available for
communication as the notice along with the interim order had been passed on 28.11.2011, and
pursuant to the notice under challenge when the assessment order has been passed by the Assessing
Officer on the very same day, when the very notice is not being found sustainable, there is a need to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83153580/ 13Madhav Builders, , Ahmedabad vs Assessee on 1 February, 2016
quash both the impugned notices dated 17.3.2011 18.11.2011 and all consequential proceedings and
the order of assessment dated 28.12.2011 passed pursuant thereto. Petition is accordingly allowed.
No order as to costs."
22. By referring to the above mentioned paragraph in the decision of Hon. Gujarat High Court in
assessee's own case, ld. DR mentioned that the assessee was being termed as "works contractor"
and, therefore, submitted that as the Hon. High Court has mentioned the assessee as a works
contractor, the same should be construed for the purpose of section 80IB(10) of the Act and the
assessee should not be allowed the benefit of section 80IB(10) of the Act as the assessee is not a
developer but works contractor.
23. By going through the decision of Hon. Jurisdictional High Court in assessee's own case we find
that this Special Civil Asst. Year 2006-07 Application of assessee was filed by the assessee against
the action of Assessing Officer for reopening of assessment by issuing an impugned notice u/s 148
for Asst. Year 2004-05 being undertaken beyond four years after the end of the regular assessment
year and even after the scrutiny assessment was completed u/s 143(3) of the Act, assessee has
disclosed fully and truly all material facts. Hon. High Court has discussed the issue relating to
reopening of assessment and has decided the same in favour of the petitioner and held that the
action of Assessing Officer was not justified in reopening the assessment. We find that this Special
Civil Application was not in relation to the issue that whether the assessee is a developer or a works
contractor and therefore there was no occasion to discuss this issue in the decision on the Special
Civil Application filed before the Hon. Curt. Therefore, we are not convinced with the contention of
ld. DR of treating the assessee as works contractor only on the basis of mentioning in a general
parlance that the assessee is works contractor. Now going ahead we will examine this aspect in detail
in the light of the facts of the case that whether the business activity carried on by the assessee are in
the nature of a developer or of a works contractor. In order to study the difference between a
developer and a contractor we would like to refer to the decision of ITAT, Chennai Bench in the case
of Prime Developers vs. ITO, Ward -1(4)-Tirupur in ITA No.933(Mds) of 2013, for Asst. Year
2009-10 dated September 23, 2015, which reads as under :-
6.1 The contention of the ld. AR is that the assessee is a developer and not mere a contractor and
being so, the assessee is entitled to deduction under section 80-IB(10) of Asst. Year 2006-07 the Act.
Now, we have to examine as to whether the assessee can be called as a "developer" within the
meaning of section 80-IB(10) read with Explanation I herein above. The ld. AR submitted that the
work carried on by the assessee made it a developer entitled for deduction under section 80-IB(10)
of the Act. According to him, a developer is a person who develops the facility and such person may
or may not be a contractor. On the other hand, a contractor is stated to be a legal term whose rights
and duties vis- à-vis contractee are determined by way of legal document called the contract.
According to the ld. AR, the assessee has undertaken all risks involved in the project including
technological inputs, entrepreneurial inputs etc. Besides, there is heavy financial involvement in
terms of deployment of man and machine as well as all materials. At this point, it is pertinent to
note that the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. v. State of
Orissa [1989] 55 STC 327 in which it has been observed that in a contract for work, the person
producing has no property in the thing produced as a whole, even if part or whole of the material
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83153580/ 14Madhav Builders, , Ahmedabad vs Assessee on 1 February, 2016
used by him may have been his property earlier. Further, in another judgment of the Supreme Court
in the case of State of Tamil Nadu v. Anandam Viswanathan [1989] 1 SCC 613 in which it was held
that the nature of contract can be found only when the intention of parties are found out. The fact
that in the execution of the works contract some material are used and the property in the goods so
used passes to the other party, the contractor undertaking the work will not necessarily be deemed,
on that account, to sell the material. It was, therefore, argued that the developer is a person who
brings in additional resources by way of investment and technical expertise for developing the
infrastructure facilities. Since the assessee had simply done a part of work of civil construction
relating to the housing project, he stated that it is not eligible for deduction.
6.2 We find that the words 'developer' and 'contractor' have not been defined in or for the purposes
of section 80-IB(10). The primary question which arises is that how to find out the meaning of a
word or an expression which is not defined in the Act. It is a settled legal position that ordinarily the
meaning or definition of a word used in one statute cannot per se be imported into another as has
been held by the Supreme Court in the case of Union of India v. R.C. Jain [1981] 2 SCC 308.
Therefore, the meaning of the words developer and contractor, as put forth before us by the rival
parties from other legislations, be they State or Central enactments, cannot be automatically applied
in the present context. In order to ascertain the meaning of a word not defined in the Act, a useful
reference can be made to the General Clauses Act, 1897. If a particular word is not defined in the
relevant statute but has been defined in the General Clauses Act, such definition throws ample light
for guidance and adoption in the former enactment. According to s. 3 of the General Clauses Act the
definitions given in this Act shall have applicability in all the Central Acts unless a contrary
definition is provided of a particular word or expression. On scanning s. 3 of the General Clauses Act
we observe that neither the word 'contractor' nor 'developer' has been defined therein. Thus, the
General Clauses Act is also of no assistance in this regard. Going ahead, when these words are
neither defined in the IT Act, 1961 nor in the General Clauses Act, the next question is that
wherefrom to find the meaning of such words. There is no need to wander here and there in search
of an answer which has been aptly given by the Supreme Court in the case of CWT v.
Officer-In-Charge (Court of Wards) [1976] 105 ITR 133 (SC) in which it was held that the ordinary
dictionary meaning of a word cannot be disregarded.
6.3 Coming back to our point of ascertaining the meaning of the words 'contractor' as well as
'developer', which have neither been defined in the Act nor in the General Clauses Act, we fall upon
Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary to find out their meaning. According to this dictionary
"developer" is a person or company that designs and creates new products, whereas "contractor" is a
person or a company that has a contract to do Asst. Year 2006-07 work or provides services or
goods to another. The New Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines the word "contractor" as: "A person
who enters into a contract or agreement. Now chiefly spec. a person or firm that undertakes work by
contract, especially for building to specified plans". In the light of the meaning ascribed to these
words by the dictionaries it is observed that the developer is a person who designs and creates new
products. He is the one who conceives the project. He may execute the entire project himself or
assign some parts of it to others. On the contrary the contractor is the one who is assigned a
particular job to be accomplished on the behalf of the developer. His duty is to translate such design
into reality. There may, in certain circumstances, be overlapping in the work of developer and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83153580/ 15Madhav Builders, , Ahmedabad vs Assessee on 1 February, 2016
contractor, but the line of demarcation between the two is thick and unbreachable. When the person
acting as developer, who designs the project, also executes the construction work, he works in the
capacity of contractor too. But when he assigns the job of construction to someone else, he remains
the developer simpliciter, whereas the person to whom the job of construction is assigned, becomes
the contractor. The role of developer is much larger than that of the contractor. It is no doubt that in
certain circumstances a developer may also do the work of a contractor but a mere contractor per se
can never be called as a developer, who undertakes to do work according to the pre- decided plan.
6.4 So, in order to be eligible for deduction, the development should be that of housing project as a
whole and not a particular part of it, as has been contended by the ld. AR. It may be possible that
some part of the housing project is assigned by the land lord to some contractor for doing it on his
behalf. That will not put the doer of such work in the shoes of a developer.
24. The above referred decision of the Tribunal, Chennai Bench makes it crystal clear that a
developer takes on the basic of housing project right from the beginning i.e. from the point of time
when the plan of the housing project are approved, travels through the creating of design of the
project, arranging of finance as well as booking of the units of the project and to appoint various
agencies relating to the start and finishing of the project which inter alia also includes the
appointment of various types of contractors for different types of works to be carried out. In the
present case, the above said aspect can be examined by going through some of the clauses of
development agreement dated 26.8.2003 between the assessee i.e Madhav Builders and Shree
Madhav Co-op. Housing Society Ltd. copy of whch is placed in the paper book dated Asst. Year
2006-07 3/11/2015 at pages 1 to 110. Some parts of development agreement are as under :-
(3) The said organizer/building is carrying out all constructed related work. In this way, the main
work and activity of the said builder is to development housing projects or to remain attached with
the work of construction and to carry out/get carried out the construction work.
(5) In order to fulfill the desire of procuring residential units for its members on the said property,
as per the wish of the members by the said housing society on the above referred property, the
society is planning to organize a scheme of residential housing units on the said land but the said
housing society is lacking the skill and the funds required for financial investment for fulfilling the
said scheme and due to lack of necessary efficiency and necessary expertise and time by the
office-bearers of the housing society for enrolling new members in the said housing society as and
when required, they themselves are not in a position to organize a scheme on the said land and
under such circumstances, the said housing society has till date taken help of the First Party Builder.
And from now onwards, appointing the said builder as organizer/builder, the society is planning of
entrusting the liability of organizing the said scheme to the said First Party
-Organiser and for that the society is desirous of handing over all the working powers. And whereas
as the said First Party - Organiser / Builder Partnership firm is holding necessary qualification,
efficiency, working capacity and skill required for organizing the scheme as per the desirous of the
members of the housing society the said housing society is desirous of handing over and entrusting
such liability and responsibility by appointing the said organizer/developer/builder in pursuance to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83153580/ 16Madhav Builders, , Ahmedabad vs Assessee on 1 February, 2016
the said Development Agreement and the said organizer has accepted such responsibility. Moreover,
the said organizer accepts the responsibility and liability of developing the land mentioned in the
said agreement to sale as stated hereinabove by entering into this agreement.
Asst. Year 2006-07 (6) The planning of the above stated scheme of the said housing society is to be
done by the said organizer and the name of the said scheme has been given as Madhav Park Part-4
(Shri Madhav Co-op. Housing Society Ltd.), which name would remain forever. And without the
written permission of the said housing society, no change in the name can be made.
(7) As stated herein above, the said developer/Organiser/builder is entrusted the below mentioned
powers for organizing the said housing society scheme.
(7.1) To appoint Architect, Engineer, Supervisor, Contractor, Legal Advisor and other professionals
whose services are required for completing the said scheme and to decide and fix their area of
operation and to decide their remuneration and fee, which is to be borne by the Second Party
-Executant.
(7.2) To enter into contract, sub-contract, labour contract, material contract etc. in order to
complete by carrying out construction in the scheme of the said housing society as per the
specification, as per the item or on lump sum price and to provide necessary basic materials etc. for
completing the said housing society scheme and for that the organizer will provide all types of help
and aid.
(7.3) The organizer will have to collect construction fund, land fund and the amounts of deposits
with regard to other expenses from the present members and from the proposed members in order
to meet with the construction cost and other related expenses of the said scheme by issuing pucca
receipt thereof.
(7.9) The said organizer would allot concerned properties to the member of the said housing society
getting enrolled in the said schemes as per the said scheme and in the final scheme that would be
formed after necessary changes and in the concerned tenement, open land and common amenities
etc. But the final decision of the said organizer with Asst. Year 2006-07 regard to the allotment of
the property to the members would be acceptable and binding to the said housing society and its
members and proposed members.
(7.10) The said housing housing society has entrusted all the rights and powers to the organizer for
the purpose of completing and erecting the said scheme and all other related powers and therefore
the said organizer will have to complete the said scheme using his discrepancy and as per his
wisdom by taking decision that may be deemed fit and proper by him and till the society does not
complete the accounts related to the funds invested by the organizer from the date of the
implementation of the said scheme is to be maintained by the organizer. The concerned accounts
submitted by the said organizer to the said housing society is to be accepted by the said housing
society without any dispute and objection and moreover the accounts pertaining to the said scheme
submitted by the said organizer is to be accepted by the housing society without any sort of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83153580/ 17Madhav Builders, , Ahmedabad vs Assessee on 1 February, 2016
criticism, remark, audit or doubt whatsoever and the said accounts are to be included in the records
of the housing society and moreover an understanding has been arrived at between the parties that
with regard to the audit of the said housing society, the accounts procured by the said organizer by
the said housing society and the accounts as per the gradual progress of the said scheme is to be
understood as acceptable and the records and books of accounts of the said organizer with regard to
the same would not be subject to audit or verification, which has been clearly understood by both
the parties.
(7.11) As per the said scheme, the said organizer has given related estimated lumpsum price of the
said scheme and the construction of the tenements etc. as shown in the plan but as per the stagewise
progress of the said scheme and as per the changes that may be made in the said scheme and
whatever changes that may be made in the concerned circumstances, the said organizer would be
authorised to revise the said estimated amount and the same would be acceptable and binding to the
said housing society and its Asst. Year 2006-07 members and the new members getting enrolled in
the said scheme.
(7.13) If the first party is required to submit necessary applications, replies, statements and forms
for and on behalf of the second party in any Government or Semi Government office or legal court or
any other place then all such proceedings is to be done by the first party and the first party is hereby
empowered for the same. Inspite of that in future if any specific power of attorney or authority is
required to be submitted then at that time the second party will have to give concerned authority or
power of attorney in favour of the first party.
25. By going through the various clauses of the development agreement dated 28.8.2003 between
the assessee and the land owner Shree Madhav Co-op. Housing Society, it can be construed that the
assessee is having much wider authority -rights and powers for accomplishing the plan of the
housing project and certainly such type of powers and rights which are exercised along with
collection of revenue from each unit of the housing project and successful completion of each part of
the housing project very well justify to large extent that assessee was working as developer and not
works contractor. Further we have also examined the financial statement of the assessee and find
that in the audited balance sheet as on 31.3.2006 assessee has shown sundry debtor of
Rs.1,99,21,445/-, the list of which includes 42 parties including Shri Madhav Co-op. Housing Society
Ltd. being a sundry debtor of Rs.8,87,166/- and the remaining amount of debtor i.e.
Rs.1,90,34,279/- are being debit balance in the names of various flat owners from whom the
assessee had yet to receive the amount Asst. Year 2006-07 which it has spent for the housing
project. This shows that assessee was not working only as a work contractor on behalf of Shree
Madhav Co-op. Housing Society Ltd. else the assessee would have been showing the complete
outstanding balance in the name of Shree Madhav Co-op. Housing Society Ltd. This fact has not
been controverted by the revenue at any stage below and, therefore, looking to the terms and
conditions of the development agreement and audited financial statement of the assessee, we are of
the view that assessee comes under the category of developer and not of works contractor and,
therefore, comes within the definition of developer as referred in the provisions of section 80IB(10)
of the Act.

(2) Whether the assessee fulfills all the conditions of section 80IB(10) of the Act other than the
matters mentioned at point (1) above;
26. The issue entails upon to examine that whether the assessee (now as we have held that assessee
is a developer) fulfills all the other conditions which are required to be adhered upon for claiming
the deduction u/s 80IB(10). We find that assessee has been granted deduction u/s 80IB(10) at
Rs.75,72,250/- in Asst. Year 2004-05 which was assessed u/s 143(3) of the Act by ITO, Ward 9(2),
Ahmedabad on 28.03.2006. Similarly, for Asst. Year 2005-06 assessee was allowed deduction u/s
80IB(10) at Rs.1,66,40,818/- vide assessment order u/s 143(3) of the Act dated 6.7.2007 issued by
ITO Wd-9(2), Ahmedabad and even for Asst. Year 2006-07 assessee was granted deduction at Asst.
Year 2006-07 Rs.1,32,19,672/- u/s 80IB(10) of the Act in the assessment completed u/s 143(3) of
the Act on 4.1.2008. So from these statistics it is amply clear that assessee has been consistently
allowed benefit u/s 80IB(10) of the Act by the assessing officer and certainly assessee being a
developer must have furnished all the relevant information required to justify its claim to be eligible
for deduction u/s 80IB(10). Further in support of our above observations, we find that Co-ordinate
bench in the case of Golden Developer vs. ITO (OSD), Range-9, Ahmedabad, in ITA
No.496/Ahd/2011 for Asst. Year 2007-08, vide its order dated 13.11.2014 has dealt with similar
issue and has held as follows :-
"4.2. The contention of the assessee is that in earlier years claim of the assessee was allowed by the
Department in scrutiny assessment. The ld.counsel for the assessee has drawn our attention towards
page-7 of the paper-book, wherein the assessment order pertaining to the AY 2005-06 is enclosed.
The AO has allowed the claim of the assessee for deduction u/s.80-IB(10) of the Act. At page No.10
of the paper-book is enclosed the assessment pertaining to the AY 2006-07, wherein also the AO
also allowed the claim of the assessee of deduction u/s.80IB(10) of the Act. Facts are identical and
project is also same and the Revenue has not pointed out as to how the claim that was allowed in
earlier years and ITA No.496 /Ahd/2011 M/s.Golden Developers vs. ITO (OSD) Asst.Year - 2007-08
- 6 - under the same facts and circumstances would be disallowable in the year under consideration.
It is settled position of law that every year is an independent year, however, the rule of consistency is
to be adopted by the Revenue authority while framing the assessment. In the present case, the
Revenue has not brought out any new material on the basis of which a different view has been taken
for the year under consideration. If the assessee was 'developer' in the earlier years, it would remain
so in the following years unless a new material comes to notice of AO or otherwise which was
available on record but was not considered in earlier years. Nowhere in the orders of the authorities
below this fact has been recorded. Therefore, in our considered view, the Revenue was not justified
in rejecting the claim for deduction u/s.80IB(10) of the Act in this year. It is also noteworthy that
the authorities below have not recorded any finding as to what was the remuneration fixed by the
contract and how the submission of the assessee that it was bearing all risks and consequences
arising from the contract were not correct. In fact, the AO has stated these stipulations are only
intended to make the Society toothless but they cannot convert by any stretch of imagination an
agreement Asst. Year 2006-07 for construction into a conveyance deed in the eyes of the law. It is
not disputed that such terms and conditions were in the agreement in the earlier years also. On the
basis of such terms the assessee was found to have fulfilled the conditions as envisaged u/s.80IB(10)
of the Act. In our considered view, the construction of any agreement cannot be different in two
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83153580/ 19Madhav Builders, , Ahmedabad vs Assessee on 1 February, 2016
different assessment years, therefore the orders of the authorities below rejecting the claim of
deduction u/s.80-IB(10) of the Act cannot be confirmed, more ITA No.496 /Ahd/2011 M/s.Golden
Developers vs. ITO (OSD) Asst.Year - 2007-08 - 7 - particularly in the light of the judgement of the
Hon'ble Gujarat High Court rendered in the case of CIT vs. Radhe Developers reported at (2012) 341
ITR 403 (Guj.) and followed subsequently in a series of decisions of this Tribunal. Thus, this sole
ground of the assessee's appeal is allowed and the disallowance made by the AO is hereby deleted."
27. Relying on the above decision of the co-ordinate bench in the case of Golden Developer vs. ITO
(OSD), Range-9, Ahmedabad (supra) and looking to the facts of the case of assessee and applying
the ratio of consistency, we find that assessee has successfully been able to fulfill all the requisite
conditions for getting deduction u/s 80IB(10) of the Act.
(3) Whether it is a pre-condition for claiming exemption u/s 80IB(10) of the Act that the developer
holds the land on which the housing project has been constructed;
28. Objection has been raised by the Assessing Officer during assessment proceedings by
mentioning the fact that assessee was not the owner of the land on which the housing project was
carried out and all the permissions were granted to the land owner i.e. Shree Madhav Co-op.
Housing Society Ltd. and not the assessee and approval of plan of construction issued by the local
authority was in the name of land owner and not the assessee and the constructions were done in a
tripartite agreement executed between the members, Shree Madhav Co-op. Housing Society Ltd.
and the assessee and, therefore, Assessing Officer was of the Asst. Year 2006-07 view that assessee
is merely a contractor for the purpose of construction of the project.
29. We find that apart from the fact discussed above that assessee is a developer and not a works
contractor, assessee is eligible for deduction u/s 80IB(10) of the Act in a situation when the land on
which the housing project is constructed is not in the ownership of the developer. This finding is
based on the decision of Hon. Jurisdictional High Court in the case of Radhe Developers wherein
their Lordships has given the decision that the assessees were entitled to the benefit under Section
80IB(10) of the Act even where the title of the lands had not passed on to the assessees and in some
cases, the development permissions may also have been obtained in the name of the original land
owners. Relevant extract of the decision is as under :-
"39. We may now move on to the question of ownership of the land.
40. Relevant portion of Section 2(47) reads as under:-
"2(47): "transfer", in relation to a capital asset, includes,-
(v) any transaction involving the allowing of the possession of any immovable
property to be taken or retained in part performance of a contract of the nature
referred to in section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882(4 of 1882);
or Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act reads as under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83153580/ 20Madhav Builders, , Ahmedabad vs Assessee on 1 February, 2016
53A. Where any person contracts to transfer for consideration any immovable
property by writing signed by him or on his behalf from which the terms necessary to
constitute the transfer can be ascertained with reasonable certainty, and the
transferee has, in part performance of the contract, taken possession of the property
or any part thereof, or the transferee, being already in possession, continues in
possession in part performance of the contract and has done some act in furtherance
of the contract, and the transferee has performed or is willing to perform his part of
the contract, then notwithstanding that where there is an instrument of transfer, that
the transfer has not been completed in the manner prescribed therefor by the law for
the time being in force, the transferor or any person claiming under him shall be
debarred from enforcing against the transferee and persons claiming under him any
Asst. Year 2006-07 right in respect of the property of which the transferee has taken
or continued in possession, other than a right expressly provided by the terms of the
contract:
Provided that nothing in this section shall affect the rights of a transferee for
consideration who has no notice of the contract or of the part performance thereof."
41. In the present case, we find that the assessee had, in part performance of the agreement to sell
the land in question, was given possession thereof and had also carried out the construction work
for development of the housing project. Combined reading of Section 2(47)(v) and Section 53A of
the Transfer of Property Act would lead to a situation where the land would be for the purpose of
Income Tax Act deemed to have been transferred to the assessee. In that view of the matter, for the
purpose of income derived from such property, the assessee would be the owner of the land for the
purpose of the said Act. It is true that the title in the land had not yet passed on to the assessee. It is
equally true that such title would pass only upon execution of a duly registered sale deed. However,
we are, for the limited purpose of these proceedings, not concerned with the question of passing of
the title of the property, but are only examining whether for the purpose of benefit under Section
80IB (10) of the Act, the assessee could be considered as the owner of the land in question. As held
by the Apex Court in the case of Mysore Minerals Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Income Tax (supra), and
in the case of Commissioner of Income-Tax vs. Podar Cement Pvt. Ltd. and others (supra), the
ownership has been understood differently in different context. For the limited purpose of
deduction under Section 80IB(10) of the Act, the assessee had satisfied the condition of ownership
also; even if it was necessary.
42. In the case of Shakti Corporation similarly the assessee had entered into a development
agreement with the land owners on similar terms and conditions. It is true that there were certain
minor differences, however, in so far as all material aspects are concerned, we see no significant or
material difference. Here also assessee was given full rights to develop the land by putting up the
housing project at its own risk and cost. Entire profit flowing therefrom was to be received by the
assessee. It is true that the agreement provided that the assessee would receive remuneration.
However, such one word used in the agreement cannot be interpreted in isolation out of context.
When we read the entire document, and also consider that in form of "remuneration" the assessee
had to bear the loss or as the case may be take home the profits, it becomes abundantly clear that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83153580/ 21Madhav Builders, , Ahmedabad vs Assessee on 1 February, 2016
project was being developed by him at his own risk and cost and not that of the land owners.
Assessee thus was not working as a works contract. Introduction of the Explanation to Section
80IB(10) therefore in this group of cases also will have no effect.
43. We may at this stage examine the ratio of different judgments cited by the Revenue. The decision
in case of Faqir Chand Gulati vs. Uppal Agencies Private Limited and another (supra) was rendered
in the background of the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act. In the case before the Apex
Court, the land owner had entered into an agreement with the builder requiring him to construct
apartment building on the land in question. Part of the constructed area was to be retained by the
owner of the land. In consideration of the land price remaining area was free for the builder to sell.
When the land owner found series of defects in the construction, he approached the Consumer
Protection Forum. It was in this background the Apex Court was considering whether the land
owner can be stated to be a consumer and the builder a service provider. It was in this background
that the Apex Court made certain observations. Such observations cannot be seen out of context nor
can the same be applied in the present case where we are concerned with the deduction under
Section 80IB( 10) of the Act.
44. In the case K. Raheja Development Corporation vs. State of Karnataka (supra), the Apex Court
considered whether the builder, who was engaged in the development of property and for such
purpose had entered into an agreement with the land owner, can be stated to have executed works
contract. Such interpretation was rendered in the background of the term Asst. Year 2006-07
"works contract" defined in Section 2(1)(v-i) of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act, which reads as under:-
"12. Section 2(1)(v-i) is relevant. It defines a "works contract" as follows:
"2.(1)(v-i) 'works contract' includes any agreement for carrying out for cash, deferred
payment or other valuable consideration, the building, construction, manufacture,
processing, fabrication, erection, installation, fitting out, improvement, modification,
repair or commissioning of any movable or immovable property;"
It is thus to be seen that under the Karnataka Sales Tax Act the definition of the
words "works contract" is very wide. It is not restricted to a "works contract" as
commonly understood i.e. a contract to do some work on behalf of somebody else. It
also includes "any agreement for carrying out either for cash or for deferred payment
or for any other valuable consideration, the building and construction of any movable
and immovable property". (emphasis supplied) The definition would therefore take
within its ambit any type of agreement wherein construction of a building takes place
either for cash or deferred payment, or valuable consideration. To be also noted that
the definition does not lay down that the construction must be on behalf of an owner
of the property or that the construction cannot be by the owner of the property. Thus
even if an owner of property enters into an agreement to construct for cash, deferred
payment or valuable consideration a building or flats on behalf of anybody else, it
would be a works contract within the meaning of the term as used under the said
Act."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83153580/ 22Madhav Builders, , Ahmedabad vs Assessee on 1 February, 2016
It was in background of this definition provided by the statute that the Apex Court concluded that
the agreement was one of works contract. The Apex Court observed that the term works contract
contained in the Act is inclusive definition and includes not merely the works contract as normally
understood but it is a wide definition which includes any agreement for carrying out building or
construction activity for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration. Thus the
interpretation rendered by the Apex Court in the said decision was based on not the normal
meaning of term "works contract" but on the special meaning assigned to it under the Act itself,
which provided for a definition of the inclusive nature.
45. Under the circumstances, we are of the opinion that the Tribunal committed no error in holding
that the assessees were entitled to the benefit under Section 80IB(10) of the Act even where the title
of the lands had not passed on to the assessees and in some cases, the development permissions may
also have been obtained in the name of the original land owners.
30. Further in the case of CIT vs. Moon Star Developers in Tax Appeal No.549 of 2008 & others,
vide judgment dated 5 & 11/03/2014, Hon. Jurisdictional High Court on similar issue has held as
under :-
"36. We have noted at some length, the relevant terms and conditions of the development
agreements between the Asst. Year 2006-07 assessees and the land owners in case of Radhe
Developers. We also noted the terms of the agreement of sale entered into between the parties. Such
conditions would immediately reveal that the owner of the land had received part of sale
consideration. In lieu thereof he had granted development permission to the assessee. He had also
parted with the possession of the land. The development of the land was to be done entirely by the
assessee by constructing residential units thereon as per the plans approved by the local authority. It
was specified that the assessee would bring in technical knowledge and skill required for execution
of such project. The assessee had to pay the fees to the Architects and Engineers. Additionally,
assessee was also authorized to appoint any other Architect or Engineer, legal adviser and other
professionals. He would appoint Subcontractor or labour contractor for execution of the work. The
assessee was authorized to admit the persons willing to join the scheme. The assessee was
authorised to receive the contributions and other deposits and also raise demands from the
members for dues and execute such demands through legal procedure. In case, for some reason, the
member already admitted is deleted, the assessee would have the full right to include new member
in place of outgoing member. He had to make necessary financial arrangements for which purpose
he could raise funds from the financial institutions, banks etc. The land owners agreed to give
necessary signatures, agreements, and even power of attorney to facilitate the work of the developer.
In short, the assessee had undertaken the entire task of development, construction and sale of the
housing units to be located on the land belonging to the original land owners. It was also agreed
between the parties that the assessee would be entitled to use the the full FSI as per the existing
rules and regulations. However, in future, rules be amended and additional FSI be available, the
assessee would have the full right to use the same also. The sale proceeds of the units allotted by the
assessee in favour of the members enrolled would be appropriated towards the land price.
Eventually after paying off the land owner and the erstwhile proposed purchasers, the surplus
amount would remain with the assessee. Such terms and conditions under which the assessee
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83153580/ 23Madhav Builders, , Ahmedabad vs Assessee on 1 February, 2016
undertook the development project and took over the possession of the land from the original
owner, leaves little doubt in our mind that the assessee had total and complete control over the land
in question. The assessee could put the land to use as agreed between the parties. The assessee had
full authority and also Asst. Year 2006-07 responsibility to develop the housing project by not only
putting up the construction but by carrying out various other activities including enrolling members,
accepting members, carrying out modifications engaging professional agencies and so on. Most
significantly, the risk element was entirely that of the assessee. The land owner agreed to accept only
a fixed price for the land in question. The assessee agreed to pay off the land owner first before
appropriating any part of the sale consideration of the housing units for his benefit. In short,
assessee took the full risk of executing the housing project and thereby making profit or loss as the
case may be. The assessee invested its own funds in the cost of construction and engagement of
several agencies. Land owner would receive a fix predetermined amount towards the price of land
and was thus insulated against any risk.
37. By no stretch of imagination can it be said that the assessee acted only as a works contractor. The
terms works contractor has been receiving judicial attention in several cases.
xxxxxx xxxxxx
41. In the present case, we find that the assessee had, in part performance of the agreement to sell
the land in question, was given possession thereof and had also carried out the construction work
for development of the housing project. Combined reading of Section 2(47)(v) and Section 53A of
the Transfer of Property Act would lead to a situation where the land would be for the purpose of
Income Tax Act deemed to have been transferred to the assessee. In that view of the matter, for the
purpose of income derived from such property, the assessee would be the owner of the land for the
purpose of the said Act. It is true that the title in the land had not yet passed on to the assessee. It is
equally true that such title would pass only upon execution of a duly registered sale deed. However,
we are, for the limited purpose of these proceedings, not concerned with the question of passing of
the title of the property, but are only examining whether for the purpose of benefit under Section
80IB (10) of the Act, the assessee could be considered as the owner of the land in question. As held
by the Apex Court in the case of Mysore Minerals Ltd. vs Commissioner of Income Tax (supra), and
in the case of Commissioner of IncomeTax vs. Podar Cement Pvt. Ltd. and others (supra), the
ownership has been understood Asst. Year 2006-07 differently in different context. For the limited
purpose of deduction under Section 80IB(10) of the Act, the assessee had satisfied the condition of
ownership also; even if it was necessary.
42. In the case of Shakti Corporation similarly the assessee had entered into a development
agreement with the land owners on similar terms and conditions. It is true that there were certain
minor differences, however, in so far as all material aspects are concerned, we see no significant or
material difference. Here also assessee was given full rights to develop the land by putting up the
housing project at its own risk and cost. Entire profit flowing there from was to be received by the
assessee. It is true that the agreement provided that the assessee would receive remuneration.
However, such one word used in the agreement cannot be interpreted in isolation out of context.
When we read the entire document, and also consider that in form of "remuneration" the assessee
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83153580/ 24Madhav Builders, , Ahmedabad vs Assessee on 1 February, 2016
had to bear the loss or as the case may be take home the profits, it becomes abundantly clear that the
project was being developed by him at his own risk and cost and not that of the land owners.
Assessee thus was not working as a works contract. Introduction of the Explanation to Section
80IB(10) therefore in this group of cases also will have no effect.
43. We may at this stage examine the ratio of different judgments cited by the Revenue. The decision
in case of Faqir Chand Gulati vs. Uppal Agencies Private Limited and another (supra) was rendered
in the background of the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act. In the case before the Apex

owner can be stated to be a consumer and the builder a service provider. It was in this background
that the Apex Court made certain observations. Such observations cannot be seen out of context nor
can the same be applied in the present case where we are concerned with the deduction under
Section 80IB(10) of the Act.
xxxxx Asst. Year 2006-07 xxxxx
45. Under the circumstances, we are of the opinion that the Tribunal committed no error in holding
that the assessees were entitled to the benefit under Section 80IB(10) of the Act even where the title
of the lands had not passed on to the assessees and in some cases, the development permissions may
also have been obtained in the name of the original land owners."
4. Under the circumstances, in the present group of Tax Appeals also, such question is answered
against the Revenue and in favour of the assessees".
31. Respectfully following the above decisions, we are of the considered view that even in the
situation if the assessee is not the owner of the land, nor approval for construction received from the
local authority is in its name but still assessee being a developer and fulfilling all the conditions
embedded in the provisions of section 80IB(10) of the Act assessee is eligible for deduction under
section 80IB(10) of the Act.
(4) Whether the assessee is eligible to claim deduction u/s 80IB(10) of the Act for the undisclosed
income surrendered during search/survey action in a situation when assessee has been assessed in
previous years and has been allowed the deduction u/s 80IB(10) of the Act.
32. In the case of assessee pursuant to search proceedings u/s 132 of the Act, on the basis of seized
papers/documents assessee surrendered Rs.2,34,39,999/- as undisclosed profits from the housing
project namely Madhav Bunglows by showing it in the return filed pursuant to ntice u/s 153A of the
Act. However, assessee simultaneously claimed deduction u/s 80IB(10) of the Act Asst. Year
2006-07 for its undisclosed income on the ground that assessee was not having any other business
activities except the business activities carried on as a developer of housing project coming within
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83153580/ 25Madhav Builders, , Ahmedabad vs Assessee on 1 February, 2016
the ambit of section 80IB(10) of the Act and nor there was any other charge on the assessee of
earning this undisclosed income from any other sources except the business activity of working as a
developer of the housing project and, therefore, assessee claimed an additional deduction of
Rs.2,34,39,999/- u/s 80IB(10) of the Act. From perusal of the records, we find that in the group
cases of assessee in one of the case i.e. Madhav Corporation vs. ACIT Central Circle-1(4),
Ahmedabad in IT(SS)A No.380 to 382/Ahd/2014 for Asst. Year 2006-07 to 2008-09 has discussed
the issue in detail and held as under :-
5. Next issue in A.Y 2008-09 is regarding additional claim of deduction u/s.80IB(10) of the Act.
"Modification of the correct figure in original ground No.3 On the facts and in the
circumstances of the case, the Ld. Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)-I,
Ahmedabad, has grossly erred in confirming addition of Rs. 85,66,228/- being
additional claim of deduction u/s. 80IB(10) on the basis of seized records. The same
may kindly be directed to be allowed on such legitimate claim,"
5.3 In case before us, assessee has earned additional income which amount is disclosed consequence
upon the search, hence it partakes the character of business income and the assessee has admitted
that the said amount was a part of income earned from the project undertaken namely by it.
Therefore, the amount has direct and proximate connection with the normal business/development
activities, hence as eligible for deduction u/s. 80IB (10) of the Act. Once on the basis of declaration
of the assessee, the income of the assessee was accepted and has been assessed in the hands of the
assessee, the department has only disputed the factum that the project undertaken by the assessee
firm is not eligible for housing project u/s. 80IB of the Act. Thus, viewing correct interpretation of
the provision of the Act in the tune of the aforesaid judgments, the undisclosed income i.e. "on
money" being part of business income only. The same forms part of book profit and it has no other
sources of Asst. Year 2006-07 income and whatever income arising to the assessee firm is business
income. The head of income has to be determined from the nature of business which assessee was
being carried at the time of search. Therefore, additional income disclosed by the assessee being part
and parcel of business income only i.e. already IT(SS)A Nos. 380 to 382/Ahd/2014 Asst. Years
2006-07 to 2008-09 15 disclosed by the assessee firm during the course of search has been business
income and the assessee is eligible for deduction u/s. 80IB(10) of the Act. In view of the above and
consequent to search u/s. 132 of the Act, document marked as Page No. 116 at Annex. A/19 was
seized by the Department which contain noting of calculation of profit for the housing project
executed by the assessee and such profit was inclusive of "On Money" component. In response to
notice u/s. 153A of the Act, the returns of income u/s. 153A are filed which are the returns of income
u/s. 139 of the Act. The Assessing Officer has made assessment on the said returns income. The said
assessment orders were challenged before the concern CIT(A), who passed appellate orders on it
negating claim of assessee. We find that assessee has demonstrated with supportive documentary
evidence that it is eligible for the claim of deduction u/s. 80IB(10) of the Act and the same is
allowable not only on the profit disclosed in the pre-search returns of income filed u/s. 139(1) but
also on the entire profit including the one disclosed additionally subsequent to the search
proceeding u/s. 132 of the Act and disclosed in the return of income filed u/s. 153A of the Act. Even
otherwise based on the rule of consistency if the eligible project undertaken remains the same and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/83153580/ 26Madhav Builders, , Ahmedabad vs Assessee on 1 February, 2016
the conditions are satisfied and if deduction is allowable in the first assessment year (which is A.Y.
2006-07 IT(SS)A Nos. 380 to 382/Ahd/2014 Asst. Years 2006-07 to 2008-09 16 in the assessee's
case) then the same has to be allowed in the subsequent assessment years. We find that coordinate
"D" bench of Tribunal in ITA no. 496/Ahd/2011 A.Y. 2007- 08 in the case of Golden Developers Vs.
ITO (OSD), Range-9, Ahmedabad dated 13/11/2014, it was held that in case the appellant is entitled
for claim of deduction u/s. 80IB(10) in A.Y.2006-07 then the appellant is also eligible for the said
deduction in A.Ys.2007-08 & 2008-09. Following same reasoning, we hold that the assessee on this
additional income of Rs.85,66,228/- for A.Y. 2008-09 is entitled for claiming deduction u/s.
80IB(10) of the Act as discussed above. Assessing Officer is directed accordingly."
33. Respectfully applying the judgment of co-ordinate bench in the case of Madhav Corporation
(supra), we are of the view that assessee is eligible to claim deduction u/s 80IB(10) of the Act for the
undisclosed income surrendered during search/survey action in a situation when assessee has been
assessed in previous years and has been allowed deduction u/s 80IB(10) of the Act as well as there is
