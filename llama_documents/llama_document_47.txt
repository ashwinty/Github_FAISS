The petitioners in these writ petitions are aspirants for the posts of President of the District
Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum (hereinafter referred to as 'DCDRF'). They comprise of
persons who have held the office of President DCDRF in the past, Retired District Judges and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172446381/ 4N.Premkumar vs State Of Kerala
persons who are qualified to be appointed as District Judges. They are aggrieved by the selection
procedure that was followed by the State Government in connection with appointments made to the
posts of President of the DCDRF's in Thiruvananthapuram, Pathanamthitta, Kannur, Kozhikode,
Ernakulam, Thrissur, Idukki and Palakkad districts of the State.
2. The facts in the writ petitions would indicate that the State Government had, by a letter dated
08.12.2013, requested the High Court to forward a panel of qualified persons comprising of sitting
District Judges/retired District Judges and persons qualified to be W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con.
cases appointed as District Judges for considering them for appointment to the posts of President in
the eight DCDRF's mentioned above. On receipt of the said letter, the High Court, through an
Official Memorandum dated 17.01.2014 addressed to the Principal District Judges of the 14 Districts
in the State, requested them to circulate the Government letter to all subordinate courts and bar
associations in their district and to obtain and forward the Biodata of eligible candidates who were
willing to be considered for appointment to the posts in question. Thereafter, on receipt of
applications from candidates, the High Court forwarded the same to the Government. It would
appear that, thereafter, the selection committee that was constituted to prepare a select list of
eligible candidates for forwarding to the State Government conducted an interview at
Thiruvananthapuram, between 8th and 9th of October, 2014. The said committee prepared separate
lists, comprising of five candidates each, for each of the 8 districts where an appointment to the post
of President of the DCDRF was contemplated. These lists were then forwarded to the State
Government for its consideration for appointment to the vacant posts of President of the DCDRF.
The State Government, thereafter, selected eight persons to be appointed as
W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases Presidents of the DCDRF in the eight districts mentioned above,
and their appointments were duly notified through separate Notifications dated 23.12.2014. As
already noticed, the said appointments are challenged in the writ petitions wherein the persons
appointed have also been impleaded as respondents.
3. The main grounds of challenge, against the above selection process that was undertaken by the
Government, are as follows:
The selection process was undertaken in a manner that lacked transparency. The
selection was made solely based on an interview conducted by the selection
committee and there was no rank list prepared of candidates who had attended the
interview. Even the interview was conducted in haste and a total of 93 candidates
were interviewed in just two days.
The panel of eligible candidates that was to be drawn up for forwarding to the State Government had
to be one that was prepared category wise, as mandated in Rule 7 of the Kerala Consumer Protection
Rules. In the instant case, while such a panel was not drawn up, the selection committee proceeded
to draw up separate panels of five candidates each for each of the eight districts
W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases where an appointment was to be made to the post of President
of the DCDRF.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172446381/ 5N.Premkumar vs State Of Kerala
In the matter of selection of a candidate to the post of President of the DCDRF, a requirement of
consultation with the High Court had to be read into the provisions of the Consumer Disputes Act.
As per the provisions of the Act, a person seeking appointment to the post of President of the
DCDRF had to be a Sitting District Judge, a retired District judge or a person qualified to be
appointed as a District Judge. The qualifications prescribed for the post, therefore, unambiguously
indicate that the post in question is a judicial post and it's functioning akin to that of a Court dealing
with civil and criminal matters. Similarly, the powers of the DCDRF, as specified in the Consumer
Disputes Act, clearly indicate that the forum is to exercise the powers that were earlier exercised by a
Court, that now stood transferred to it under the Act, and this is reason enough to deem the
President of the forum as a District Judge, within the meaning of the term under Article 236 of the
Constitution of India and, consequently, to insist on an adherence to the appointment procedure
contemplated under Article 234 of the Constitution, while making appointments to the said post.

6. A perusal of the statutory provisions would clearly indicate that a process of consultation with the
High Court is not envisaged W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases while making appointments to the
post of President of the DCDRF. The issue to be considered then is, whether such a process has to be
read into the statutory provisions? It might not be out of place to mention, at this juncture, that in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172446381/ 11N.Premkumar vs State Of Kerala
none of the writ petitions is there a challenge against the provisions of the Statute, to the extent it
does not provide for a process of consultation. However, since lengthy arguments were addressed by
counsel for the petitioners on this aspect, I cannot but deal with the said arguments, while disposing
these writ petitions.
7. As already noticed, the crux of the arguments of learned counsel for the petitioners is that the
qualifications prescribed for the post of President of the DCDRF unambiguously indicate that the
post in question is a judicial post and it's functioning akin to that of a Court dealing with civil and
criminal matters. Similarly, the powers of the DCDRF, as specified in the Consumer Disputes Act,
clearly indicate that the forum is exercising the powers that were earlier exercised by a Court, that
now stood transferred to it under the Act, and this is reason enough to deem the President of the
forum as a District Judge, within the meaning of the term under Article 236 of the Constitution
W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases of India and, consequently, to insist on an adherence to the
appointment procedure contemplated under Article 234 of the Constitution, while making
appointments to the said post. Reliance is placed on the decisions in Chandramouleshwar Prasad v.
Patna High Court and Others - [AIR 1970 SC 370]; State of Maharashtra v. Labour Law
Practitioners' Association and Others - [AIR 1998 SC 1233]; All India Judges Association and Others
v. Union of India and Others - [(2002) 4 SCC 247]; Dr.J.J. Merchant v. Shrinath Chaturvedi [(2002)
6 SCC 635]; Ashok Tanwar v. State of H.P. [2005 KHC 602]; Madras Bar Association v. Union of
India and Another - [(2014) 10 SCC 1]; and Nawal Kishore Mishra and Others v. High Court of
Judicature of Allahabad Through Its Registrar General and Others - [(2015) 5 SCC 479].
8. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondents would contend, placing reliance on the decisions
of the Supreme Court in Laxmi Engineering Works v. P.S.G. Industrial Institute - [(1995) 3 SCC
583] and Dr.J.J. Merchant v. Shrinath Chaturvedi [(2002) 6 SCC 635], that the DCDRF constituted
under the W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases Consumer Protection Act is not a Court. It is also
their contention that under the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, a procedure for
consultation, that is expressly provided for in connection with the appointment of the President of
the State CDRF, is deliberately excluded in the case of appointment of the President of a DCDRF,
and in the absence of a challenge to the statutory provisions, the petitioners cannot be heard to
contend that the selection procedure was illegal on account of a non-consultation. Alternatively, it is
contended that, even if a procedure for consultation could be read into the provisions of the Statute,
the same could only have application to future appointments and cannot vitiate the selection process
already concluded.
9. On a consideration of the rival submissions, I find that the arguments of counsel for the
petitioners are premised mainly on the fact that judicial review has now been recognised as a basic
feature of our Constitution. One cannot but accept that the task of adjudication under the
Constitutional scheme cannot be entrusted to non-judicial bodies. It is well settled through a
plethora of judgments of the Supreme Court that the independence of the judiciary is to be ensured
W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases so as to have an effective system of judicial review and
consequently, primacy in respect of appointments, removal and transfer of judicial posts should vest
with the judiciary itself with minimal involvement of the executive and the legislature. The issue of
whether a similar independence from executive pressure needs to be ensured even in respect of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172446381/ 12N.Premkumar vs State Of Kerala
members of Tribunals, that are constituted under various enactments as alternative forums to the
High Court, came up for consideration before the Supreme Court in L. Chandrakumar v. Union of
India - [(1997) 3 SCC 261] and it was held that such independence from executive pressure would be
mandated only if the alternate forum that was put in place was no less effective than the High Court.
The Court also held that the power vested in the High Courts, of judicial superintendence over all
courts and tribunals within their respective jurisdictions, was also part of the basic structure of our
Constitution. Taking cue from the said judgment, in Madras Bar Association v. Union of India -
[(2014) 10 SCC 1], it was found that so long as the power of judicial review of the High Court was not
expressly taken away by the enactment in question, the enactment could not be struck down as
violative of the basic structure of the Constitution. In the said judgment, the Supreme Court also
W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases went into the issue of whether, while transferring jurisdiction to
a newly created court/tribunal, it was essential to maintain the standards and the stature of the
court replaced. The findings of the Court on this aspect are as follows:
"110. In addition to the determination on the adjudication of the present controversy
on the concept of basic structure, the instant matter calls for a determination on the
sustainability of the NTT Act, from other perspectives also. We shall now advert to
the alternative contentions. First and foremost, it was the submission of the learned
counsel for the petitioners, that it is impermissible for legislature to abrogate/divest
the core judicial appellate functions, specially, the functions traditionally vested in a
superior court, to a quasi judicial authority devoid of essential ingredients of the
superior court. The instant submission was premised on the foundation, that such
action is constitutionally impermissible.
111. In order to determine whether or not the appellate functions which have now been vested with
the NTT, constituted the core judicial appellate function traditionally vested with the jurisdictional
High Courts, we have recorded under the heading - "The Historical Perspective", legislative details,
pertaining to the Income Tax Act, the Customs Act and the Excise Act. We had to do so, for that was
the only manner to deal with the instant aspect of the controversy. A perusal of the historical
perspective reveals, that as against the initial assessment of tax/duty liability, the first forum for
challenge has traditionally been with an executive appellate adjudicatory authority. Legislative
details reveal, that for some time there was a power of reference, exercisable on "questions of law".
The adjudication thereof rested with the jurisdictional High Courts. The second appellate remedy
has always been before a quasi-judicial appellate authority, styled as an Appellate Tribunal. Across
the board, under all the enactments which are relevant for the W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases
present controversy, proceedings before the Appellate Tribunal have been legislatively described as
"judicial proceedings". It is, therefore apparent, that right from the beginning, the clear legislative
understanding was, that from the stage of the proceedings before the Appellate Tribunal, the
proceedings were of the nature of "judicial proceedings". Again across the board, under all the
enactments, relevant for the present controversy, questions of law were originally left to be
adjudicated by the jurisdictional High Courts. The reference jurisdiction, was substituted in all the
enactments, and converted into appellate jurisdiction. The instant appellate jurisdiction was vested
with the jurisdictional High Court. Under the Income Tax Act, 1961, Section 260A, provided an
appellate remedy from an order passed by the Appellate Tribunal, to the jurisdictional High Court.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172446381/ 13N.Premkumar vs State Of Kerala
Similarly Section 129A of the Customs Act, 1962, and Section 35G of the Central Excise Act, 1944,
provided for an appellate remedy from the concerned Appellate Tribunal to the High Court. The
jurisdictional High Court would hear appeals on questions of law, against orders passed by the
Appellate Tribunals. It is, therefore apparent, that right from the beginning, well before the
promulgation of the Constitution, the core judicial appellate functions, for adjudication of tax
related disputes, were vested with the jurisdictional High Courts. The High Courts have
traditionally, been exercising the jurisdiction to determine questions of law, under all the above tax
legislations. In this view of the matter, it is not possible for us to conclude, that it was not justified
for the learned counsel for the petitioners to contend, that the core judicial appellate function in tax
matters, on questions of law, has uninterruptedly been vested with the jurisdictional High Courts.
112. Before we proceed with the matter further, it is necessary to keep in mind the composition of
the adjudicatory authorities which have historically dealt with the matters arising out of tax laws.
First, we shall deal with the composition of the Appellate Tribunals. All Appellate Tribunals which
are relevant for the present controversy were essentially comprised of Judicial Members, besides
Accountant or Technical Members. To W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases qualify for appointment
as a Judicial Member, it was essential that the incumbent had held a judicial office in India for a
period of 10 years, or had practiced as an Advocate for a similar period. It is the above qualification,
which enabled the enactments to provide, by a fiction of law, that all the said Appellate Tribunals
were discharging "judicial proceedings". The next stage of appellate determination, has been
traditionally vested with the High Courts. The income-tax legislation, the customs legislation, as
well as, the central excise legislation uniformly provided, that in exercise of its appellate jurisdiction,
the jurisdictional High Court would adjudicate appeals arising out of orders passed by the respective
Appellate Tribunals. The said appeals were by a legislative determination, to be heard by benches
comprising of at least two judges of the High Court. Adjudication at the hands of a bench consisting
of at least two judges, by itself is indicative of the legal complications, insofar as the appellate
adjudicatory role, of the jurisdictional High Court was concerned. It would, therefore, not be
incorrect to conclude, by accepting the submissions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for
the petitioners, that before and after promulgation of the Constitution, till the enactment of the NTT
Act, all legislative provisions vested the appellate power of adjudication, arising out of the Income
Tax Act, the Customs Act and the Excise Act, on questions of law, with the jurisdictional High
Courts.
113. Having recorded the above conclusion, the next issue to be determined is whether the
adjudication of the disputes arising out of the provisions under reference, must remain within the
realm of the jurisdictional High Courts? The instant proposition has two perspectives. Firstly,
whether constitutional interpretation in the manner accepted the world over (details whereof have
been narrated by us under the heading - "The Issues canvassed on behalf of the petitioners", under
the sub-title
- "The second contention"), would be a constitutional mandate, for the appellate jurisdiction
pertaining to tax matters, to remain with the High Court? Secondly, whether the express provisions
of the Constitution mandate, that tax issues should be decided by the concerned jurisdictional High
Court concerned? W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases 113.1. We shall first deal with the first
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172446381/ 14N.Premkumar vs State Of Kerala
perspective, namely, whether constitutional interpretation in the manner accepted the world over,
would be a constitutional mandate for appellate jurisdiction on tax matters, to remain with the
jurisdictional High Court. Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, reliance was
placed on judgments emerging out of the Constitutions of Jamaica, Ceylon, Australia and Canada,
rendered either by the Privy Council or the highest Courts of the concerned countries. The
contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners was, that the constitutions of the above
countries were based on the Westminster model. It was further pointed out, that the Indian
Constitution was also based on the Westminster model, and that, the instant position stands
recognized in the judgment rendered by this Court in Union of India v. Madras Bar Association case
(supra). Incidentally, it may be mentioned that we have extracted paragraph 101 of the above
judgment herein above, wherein it is so recorded. It is accordingly the contention of the learned
counsel for the petitioners, that the judgments relied upon by the petitioners on the instant aspect of
the matter, would be fully applicable to the controversy in hand. Under the constitutional
convention, adverted to in the judgments referred to on behalf of the petitioners, it was submitted,
that judicial power which rested with definite courts at the time of enactment of the constitutions
based on the Westminster model, had to remain with the same courts, even after the constitutions
had become effective and operational. Furthermore, it was submitted, that the judicial power had to
be exercised in the same manner as before, i.e., whether by a judge sitting singly, or with other
judges. And therefore it was asserted, that on constitutional conventions well recognized the world
over, appellate jurisdiction in respect of tax matters, would have to remain with the jurisdictional
High Courts, and would have to be determined by a bench of at least two judges of the High Court,
as was the position before the enactment of the Constitution, and, as has been the position
thereafter, till the promulgation of the NTT Act.
113.2. We have given our thoughtful consideration W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases to the
submission advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the petitioners, insofar as the first
perspective is concerned. We find substance in the submission advanced at the hands of the learned
counsel for the petitioners, but not exactly in the format suggested by the learned counsel. A closer
examination of the judgments relied upon lead us to the conclusion, that in every new constitution,
which makes separate provisions for the legislature, the executive and the judiciary, it is taken as
acknowledged/conceded, that the basic principle of "separation of powers" would apply. And that,
the three wings of governance would operate in their assigned domain/province. The power of
discharging judicial functions, which was exercised by members of the higher judiciary, at the time
when the constitution came into force, should ordinarily remain with the court, which exercised the
said jurisdiction, at the time of promulgation of the new constitution. But the judicial power could
be allowed to be exercised by an analogous/similar court/tribunal, with a different name. However,
by virtue of the constitutional convention, while constituting the analogous court/tribunal, it will
have to be ensured, that the appointment and security of tenure of judges of that court would be the
same, as of the court sought to be substituted. This was the express conclusion drawn in Hinds case
(supra). In Hinds case it was acknowledged, that Parliament was not precluded from establishing a
court under a new name, to exercise the jurisdiction that was being exercised by members of the
higher judiciary, at the time when the constitution came into force. But when that was done, it was
critical to ensure, that the persons appointed to be members of such a court/tribunal, should be
appointed in the same manner, and should be entitled to the same security of tenure, as the holder
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172446381/ 15N.Premkumar vs State Of Kerala
of the judicial office, at the time when the constitution came into force. Even in the treatise
"Constitutional Law of Canada" by Peter W. Hogg, it was observed; if a province invested a tribunal
with a jurisdiction of a kind, which ought to properly belong to a superior, district or county Court,
then that court/tribunal (created in its place), whatever is its official name, for constitutional
purposes has to, while replacing a superior, district or county Court, satisfy the requirements and
standards of the substituted court. This W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases would mean, that the
newly constituted court/tribunal will be deemed to be invalidly constituted, till its members are
appointed in the same manner, and till its members are entitled to the same conditions of service, as
were available to the judges of the court sought to be substituted. In the judgments under reference
it has also been concluded, that a breach of the above constitutional convention could not be
excused by good intention (by which the legislative power had been exercised, to enact a given law).
We are satisfied, that the aforesaid exposition of law, is in consonance with the position expressed
by this Court, while dealing with the concepts of "separation of powers", the "rule of law" and
"judicial review". In this behalf, reference may be made to the judgments in L. Chandra Kumar case
(supra), as also, in Union of India v. Madras Bar Association case (supra). Therein, this Court has
recognized, that transfer of jurisdiction is permissible, but in effecting such transfer, the court to
which the power of adjudication is transferred, must be endured with salient characteristics, which
were possessed by the court from which the adjudicatory power has been transferred. In recording
our conclusions on the submission advanced as the first perspective, we may only state, that our
conclusion is exactly the same as was drawn by us while examining the petitioners' previous
submission, namely, that it is not possible for us to accept, that under recognized constitutional
conventions, judicial power vested in superior courts cannot be transferred to coordinate
courts/tribunals. The answer is, that such transfer is permissible. But whenever there is such
transfer, all conventions/customs/practices of the court sought to be replaced, have to be
incorporated in the court/tribunal created. The newly created court/tribunal would have to be
established, in consonance with the salient characteristics and standards of the court which is
sought to be substituted.
113.3. Now we shall deal with the second perspective, namely, whether the provisions of the Indian
Constitution itself mandate, that tax issues at the appellate level, must be heard by the concerned
jurisdictional High Court. Insofar as the instant aspect of the matter is concerned, learned counsel
for the petitioners placed W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases reliance on Articles 50 and 225 of the
Constitution. Article 50 of the Constitution was relied upon to demonstrate the intent of the framers
of the Constitution, namely, that they wished to ensure the exclusivity and the separation of the
judiciary, from the executive. It is not necessary for us to deal with the instant aspect of the matter,
for the reason that, in the judgments rendered by this Court which have been referred to by us
herein above, the issue has already been debated with reference to Article 50 of the Constitution.
114. The other provision relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioners is Article 225 of the
Constitution. The tenor of the submission advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioners, has
been recorded by us while dealing with the second contention (advanced on behalf of the
petitioners). The same may be adverted to. There can be no doubt whatsoever, that Article 225 of the
Constitution does expressly provide, that the jurisdiction of existing High Courts and the respective
powers of the judges thereof "shall be the same as immediately before the commencement of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172446381/ 16N.Premkumar vs State Of Kerala
Constitution". It is also apparent, that the proviso thereto expressly mandates, "that any restriction
to which the exercise of original jurisdiction by any of the High Courts with respect to any matter
concerning the revenue or concerning any act ordered or done in collection thereof was subject
immediately before the commencement of the Constitution shall no longer apply to the exercise of
such jurisdiction". Insofar as the contention emerging out of the proviso is concerned, it needs to be
pointed out, that the same pertains to "the exercise of original jurisdiction by any of the High
Courts". It is, therefore apparent, that the issue in hand, namely, the appellate jurisdiction vested
with the jurisdictional High Courts, under the provisions of the Income Tax Act, the Customs Act
and the Excise Act, has no bearing to the proviso under reference. We may therefore conclude by
recording, that the instant submission advanced on behalf of the petitioners, is not made out from
Article 225 of the Constitution. W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases
10. It is the above findings of the Supreme Court that the petitioners place reliance upon to contend
that, inasmuch as the DCDRF is a forum to which the adjudicatory functions, which were earlier
discharged by the civil/criminal courts, were transferred consequent to the enactment of the
Consumer Disputes Act, it is essential that the standards and stature of the erstwhile court be
maintained while appointing the President of the DCDRF. The argument, in other words is that,
inasmuch as the qualifications prescribed for a person to be appointed as President of the DCDRF
mandate that he must either be a sitting District Judge, a retired District Judge or a person qualified
to be appointed as a District Judge, the process of appointment must be akin to the procedure
mandated under Article 233 of the Constitution of India in relation to the appointment of District
Judges, if the standards and stature of the erstwhile forum that was discharging adjudicatory
functions is to be preserved. Counsel for the petitioners would also rely on the decision of the
Supreme Court in State of Maharashtra v. Labour Law Practitioners' Association and Others - [AIR
1998 SC 1233] where a procedure of consultation with the High Court was held as mandatory while
appointing persons as Presiding Officers of the W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases Labour Courts.
Attractive though the arguments may appear at first blush, I cannot accept the analogy that is
sought to be drawn by counsel for the petitioners, between a forum that is constituted pursuant to a
transfer of adjudicatory functions from a court that was earlier discharging such functions, and a
forum such as the DCDRF that was constituted with the stated objective of creating a quasi- judicial
body providing speedy and simple redressal to consumer disputes. Although it may be a fact that
some of the powers, conferred on a court under the Civil Procedure Code and the Criminal
Procedure Code, have been conferred on the DCDRF as well, it is now well settled through the
decision of the Supreme Court in Laxmi Engineering Works v. P.S.G. Industrial Institute - [(1995) 3
SCC 583] that the DCDRF constituted under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is not a court. It
was held by the Supreme Court in the said case that the Forums constituted under the Consumer
Protection Act, 1986 are quasi-judicial tribunals brought into existence to render inexpensive and
speedy remedies to consumers and that these forums were not supposed to supplant but
supplement the existing judicial system. The idea was to provide an additional forum providing
inexpensive and speedy resolution of disputes arising W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases between
consumers and suppliers of goods and services. That apart, the provisions of the Consumer
Protection Regulations, 2005 also clearly indicate that the legislative intention, while providing for
the establishment of the DCDRF as well as the State and National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commissions, was to treat these forums as separate and distinct from a regular Court. This can be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172446381/ 17N.Premkumar vs State Of Kerala
gathered from a reading of Regulation 3, as also Regulation 26 that expressly states that in all
proceedings before the Consumer Forum, endeavour shall be made, by the parties and their counsel
to avoid the use of provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and further, that the consumer forum
shall not insist upon the parties to engage advocates. Thus, an overall consideration of the
provisions of the Act, Rules and Regulations would suggest that the DCDRF constituted under the
CPA, 1986 is not to be treated as a Court, or even as a quasi-judicial body to which functions, that
were earlier discharged by a Court, had been transferred. The DCDRF can only be viewed as an
alternate dispute redressal forum made available to a litigant in respect of rights that have been
conferred on him through the provisions of the CPA, 1986. This aspect has been re-iterated by the
Supreme Court in Dr. J.J. Merchant v. Shrinath Chaturvedi - [(2002) 6 SCC 635],
W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases where the Court held that the consumer forum is an alternative
forum established under the CPA, 1986 to discharge the functions of a civil court. I am, therefore, of
the view that the Presidents of the DCDRF's cannot be seen as akin to District Judges for the
purposes of invoking the provisions of Article 233 read with Article 236 of the Constitution in
connection with their appointments. The contention of the petitioners with regard to the necessity of
maintaining the standards and stature of a civil court while appointing the President of the DCDRF
also does not appeal to me as apposite since the statutory provisions clearly indicate that the CDCRF
was not envisaged as a forum discharging functions that were earlier discharged by a civil court but
merely as an alternate forum to a civil court.
11. I must now consider the other contention advanced by learned counsel for the petitioners
namely, that the selection process itself was vitiated on account of a non-compliance with the
procedure prescribed in Rule 7 of the Kerala Consumer Protection Rules. The contention is
essentially two fold, namely, (i) that while drawing up the panel of eligible candidates for submitting
to the State Government, the selection committee did not draw up a category wise
W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases panel as contemplated in Rule 7, but chose instead, to draw up
separate panels for each district where there was a vacancy in the post of President of the DCDRF
and (ii) that the interview itself was conducted in a hasty manner and there was no proper
assessment of suitability of the candidates. Reliance is placed on the decisions in Krishna Swami v.
Union of India and Others - [(1992) 4 SCC 605]; Chandran v. Union of India - [2003 KHC 457];
Asha Sharma v. Chandigarh Administration and Others - [(2011) 10 SCC 86] and Vijay Shankar
Pandey v. Union of India and Another - [(2014) 10 SCC 589] to substantiate the contention that this
court would be acting well within its powers of judicial review in interfering with the assessment of
suitability conducted by the selection committee in the instant case.
12. Per Contra, learned counsel for the respondents would point out that the category wise panel
that is contemplated in Rule 7 (3) is one that has to be prepared in relation to the two categories of
members viz. President of the DCDRF and other members of the DCDRF. As the selection in the
instant case was only of the Presidents of the DCDRF's, there was no necessity to prepare category
wise W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases panels. Alternatively, it is contended that, even if there was
a requirement of preparing a category wise panel for submission to the State Government, the mere
fact that such a panel was not prepared could not be viewed as vitiating the entire selection since
there was no prejudice caused on account of the non-compliance with this procedural requirement.
Reliance is placed on the decisions in State of Kerala and Others v. K.Reghu Varma and Others -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172446381/ 18N.Premkumar vs State Of Kerala
[2009 (3) KHC 582] and Susheela P.P. v. State of Kerala and Others - [2015 (2) KHC 78 [DB]] to
fortify the said contention. As regards the contention of the petitioners with regard to suitability
assessment, it is the stand of the respondents that this court would not ordinarily interfere with an
assessment of suitability, as opposed to an assessment of eligibility. Reliance is placed on the
decision of the Supreme Court in Registrar General, High Court of Madras v. R. Gandhi and Ors -
[JT (2014) 4 SC 261] to contend that an assessment of suitability is not justiciable under Article 226
of the Constitution of India.
13. On a consideration of the rival submissions on this issue, I find that as per the provisions of
Section 10 (1A) of the CPA, 1986, W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases that deals with the procedure
to be followed in connection with the appointment of the President and Members of the DCDRF, the
appointment, per se, of the President of a DCDRF is to be made by the State Government. The said
power of the State Government is, however, qualified by the requirement that the appointment has
to be on the recommendation of the selection committee constituted for the purpose. The manner in
which the selection committee is to draw up the panel of qualified candidates for forwarding to the
State Government is set out in Rule 7 of the Kerala Consumer Protection Rules, 2005, that has
already been extracted above. A reading of the above provisions would indicate that when it comes
to the preparation of a panel in connection with the appointment of the President of a DCDRF, a
panel of sitting District Judges, Retired District Judges and persons qualified to be appointed as
District Judges has to be obtained from the High Court of Kerala and the category wise panel so
obtained, after further scrutiny and short listing, with all relevant documents and details, has to be
placed before the Selection Committee. The selection committee has to then finalise a panel of
category-wise candidates, by adopting such methods as it may deem fit, and the list of qualified
candidates so finalised has to be sent to W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases the Government for
consideration for appointment. It is apparent, therefore, that when the selection committee does
finalise a list of qualified candidates, the said list has to be one that is prepared category-wise,
showing qualified candidates in each of the three categories of (i) Sitting District Judges, (ii) Retired
District Judges ad
(iii) Persons qualified to be appointed as District Judges. The insistence on a preparation of such a
category-wise list appears to be for the purposes of enabling the appointing authority viz. the State
Government, to consider candidates from different categories while making appointments. The said
purpose would be defeated if the panel that was sent to it did not mention the category to which a
candidate belonged. In the instant writ petitions, it is not in dispute that while a category wise panel
of candidates obtained from the High Court was placed before the selection committee, the selection
committee, while forwarding a finalised panel of qualified candidates to the State Government, did
not draw up or forward a category-wise panel of qualified candidates. The selection committee, on
the other hand, adopted a procedure similar to that prescribed in connection with the selection of
other members of the DCDRF viz. of forwarding separate panels of five candidates each, for each of
the Districts in W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases which there was a vacancy to the post of
President of the DCDRF. It was from such panels sent to it by the selection committee that the State
Government proceeded to make the appointments that are impugned in these writ petitions. It is
clear, therefore, that the selection committee, while forwarding a finalised panel of qualified
candidates to the State Government, did not adhere to the procedure contemplated under Rule 7 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/172446381/ 19N.Premkumar vs State Of Kerala
the KCPR, 2005. The question that then arises is whether the said procedural flaw is to be viewed as
so material as to vitiate the selection itself? It is relevant in this connection to refer to the
observations of the Division Bench of this Court in State of Kerala v. Reghu Varma - [2009 (3) KLT
634] - while dealing with the nature of the power exercised by the State Government and the extent
to which such power was qualified by the recommendations of the selection committee. In
paragraph 7 of the said judgment, this Court found as follows:
"Once the selection committee recommends a list of qualified candidates, the
appointing authority is free to appoint any candidate recommended by the selection
committee. No doubt, unless recommended by the selection committee, the
appointing authority cannot make any appointment. In other words, the appointing
authority, namely the Government, cannot appoint the candidate outside the list of
qualified candidates furnished by the selection committee and only to that extent
there is a fetter or restriction on W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases the power and
method of appointment of the President and Members of the various forums under
the Consumer Protection Act and its State Rules, on the Government."
14. The aforesaid view was re-iterated by another Division bench of this court in Susheela v. State of
Kerala - [2015 (1) KLT 1008] where the Court also found that once the candidates are shown to be in
the selection list prepared by the selection committee, there could not be any further judicial review
on the materials relating to the comparative evaluation. This latter view also finds support in the
decision of the Supreme Court in Registrar General, High Court of Madras v. R. Gandhi and Ors. -
[JT (2014) 4 SC 261] where it was held that judicial review is permissible only in respect of
assessment of eligibility and not in respect of assessment of suitability of candidates. It is apparent,
therefore, that once it is established that those selected for appointment were persons included in
the select list prepared by the selection committee, the appointment made by the State Government
cannot be questioned. Viewed in that backdrop, the mere fact that the panel that was sent to the
Government by the selection committee was not a panel that was prepared category-wise cannot be
seen as a defect that was so material as to vitiate the W.P.(C).NO.34020/2014 con. cases
appointments made. This is all the more so when even the State Government, the appointing
authority, does not have a case that the exercise of its discretionary power, in the matter of
appointment, was in any way affected by the non-furnishing of a category-wise panel of candidates.
The upshot of the above discussions, therefore, is that I do not find any material to hold the
appointments made to the posts of President of the DCDRF's as illegal. The writ petitions, in their
challenge to the said appointments, therefore, fail and are accordingly dismissed.
