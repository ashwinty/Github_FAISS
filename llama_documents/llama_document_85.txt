REPORTABLE
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 9833 of 2014
Indira Devi … Appellant
Versus
Veena Gupta & Ors. … Respondents
JUDGMENT
Rajesh Bindal, J.
1. The appellant herein has challenged the order dated September 26, 2013 passed by the High
Court of Judicature at Patna in Second Appeal No. 123 of 2000.
2. The facts of the case available on record are being noticed here. Kaleshwar Prasad Singh was
inducted as a tenant in the property in question by late Kishori Lal Sahu who was the exclusive
owner thereof. He along with his son executed a conditional sale deed dated 5.8.1977 in favour of
Indira Devi d/o Kaleshwar Prasad Singh. It was Signature Not Verified Digitally signed by POOJA
SHARMA Date: 2023.07.04 mentioned in the sale deed that vendors were in dire need of money,
17:16:32 IST Reason:
hence, with the consent of family members, conditional sale deed was Civil Appeal No. 9833 of 2014
being executed in favour of the vendee for a total sale consideration of (cid:129) 5000/-. The condition in
sale deed was that in case the vendors return the full consideration amount to the vendee by July,
1984, the vendee would return the property by means of a registered sale deed at the cost of the
vendors. In case, the vendors fail to pay the consideration money within the stipulated time, the
vendee will become exclusive owner of the property. Till then the vendee would not deal with the
property in any manner whatsoever.

3. Late Kishori Lal Sahu executed a registered gift deed dated 14.02.1983 in favour of his
daughter-in-law, Veena Gupta w/o Gopal Prasad. The description of the property was detailed out in
the Gift Deed, wherein it was stated that the executant was old and the beneficiary was taking care of
him, hence the properties are being gifted to her. Number of properties were gifted. It was
mentioned therein that the property as mentioned at column no. 5 therein was transferred to Indira
Devi by way of registered sale deed dated 5.8.1977, which can be purchased back by Veena Gupta
from Indira Devi.
4. The vendors were ready and willing to return (cid:129) 5000/- to the vendee to get the sale deed
registered back in their name but the vendee was not agreeing to the same. The civil suit was filed by
the Civil Appeal No. 9833 of 2014 respondent no.1 along with Kishori Lal Sahu (now deceased) in
1983. The prayer in the suit was for a direction to the appellant to accept (cid:129) 5000/- as consideration
money and execute sale deed in favour of respondent no.1 in respect of the house as mentioned in
the suit. On failure, decree be passed directing appellant to register the sale deed in favour of the
respondent no.1, the first plaintiff and as a consequence, the plaintiffs be put in possession of the
property in question. In the alternative, the prayer was that there is a relationship of landlord and
tenant between Kishori Lal Sahu (non deceased), the second plaintiff and Kaleshwar Prasad Singh,
the first defendant. A decree of eviction be passed in favour of the plaintiffs on the ground of
personal necessity and non payment of rent and the possession be got delivered. The Trial Court
vide judgment dated 27.9.1986 dismissed the suit. The judgment and decree of the Trial Court was
upheld by the lower appellate court vide judgment and order dated 27.1.2000. In second appeal filed
by the respondents, the judgments of the courts below were reversed by the High Court vide
judgment dated 26.09.2013. The High Court framed the following substantial questions of law:
“(i) Whether the courts below committed error in dismissing the suit of the plaintiff on wrong
approach and Civil Appeal No. 9833 of 2014 on consideration of an issue which was not material for
the purpose of adjudication of the suit?
(ii) Whether the courts below committed error in not considering the main issues involved in the
suit regarding character and construction in respect of the deed impugned?
(iii) Whether the courts below committed error in not considering the issue of merger of tenancy to
the ownership as is relevant in the deed of sale?” ARGUMENTS OF THE APPELLANTS
5. The argument raised by the learned counsel for the appellant was that late Kishori Lal Sahu
executed the conditional sale deed along with his son in favour Indira Devi on 5.8.1977. He had no
right to assign his right to repurchase the property, to any third party, the right being personal to
him. Even otherwise there was no clause in the sale deed in terms of which such right could be
assigned to anyone else. It was further submitted that the Gift Deed by which the property was given
to Veena Gupta cannot be termed as Gift Deed as there was consideration for transfer of the
property in question as she could get the property in question only on payment of the consideration
money mentioned in the sale deed. It was further submitted that from a perusal of the plaint, it is
not evident that the plaintiffs were always ready and Civil Appeal No. 9833 of 2014 willing to fulfil
the condition as mentioned in the conditional sale deed as they had no money available with them.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/180574598/ 2Indira Devi vs Veena Gupta on 4 July, 2023
Further, the stand taken by the appellant in the written statement was that late Kishori Lal Sahu was
not keeping good health, hence the Gift Deed executed in favour of Veena Gupta was not a valid
document.
6. In support of the plea that the right as conferred in the sale deed being personal, could not be
assigned, reliance was placed upon the judgments of this Court in Bhoju Mandal and Ors. vs.
Debnath Bhagat and Ors.1 and Kapilaben and Ors. vs. Ashok Kumar Jayantilal Sheth, through POA
Gopal Bhai Madhusudan Patel and Ors2. It was further argued that multiple reliefs having been
claimed in the suit, the same was not maintainable as on the one hand, the claim was for specific
performance whereas on the other hand, the plea of tenancy was also raised.
ARGUMENTS OF THE RESPONDENTS
7. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the only relief pressed by
him is at serial no. 1 in the suit i.e. with reference to the specific performance with possession. It is a
case in which late Kishori Lal Sahu, father-in-law of Veena Gupta, had 1963 Supp (2) SCR 82 (2020)
20 SCC 648 Civil Appeal No. 9833 of 2014 executed the Gift Deed in her favour pertaining to his
properties including the property in question. It is specifically mentioned in the Gift Deed that
Veena Gupta can take possession of the property sold to Indira Devi by purchasing the same from
her. She will have all rights available to her which late Kishori Lal Sahu had. As per the condition in
the sale deed, the property could be repurchased in case (cid:129) 5000/- were paid to Indira Devi up to
July, 1984. The amount was offered to Indira Devi, however, when she refused to accept the same,
civil suit was filed. As the appellants were not accepting the consideration, during the pendency of
the civil suit an application was filed in March, 1984 seeking permission to deposit (cid:129) 5000/- in the
Court. On permission being granted by the Court, the amount was deposited in Court on April 29,
1984. Hence, there was compliance of the condition laid down in the sale deed for getting the
property back. The right to get the aforesaid property back was assigned by late Kishori Lal Sahu to
the respondent no.1 vide registered gift deed. The error committed by both the courts below in
dismissing the suit was corrected by the High Court.
8. To counter the argument raised by the learned counsel for the appellant that the right being
personal to the deceased late Kishori Lal Sahu, could not be assigned, reliance was placed upon
judgment of Civil Appeal No. 9833 of 2014 this Court in T.M. Balakrishna Mudaliar vs. M.
Satyanarayana Rao and Ors.3 and Shyam Singh vs. Daryao Singh (dead) by LRs and Ors4. It was
submitted that such a right is not personal and the same can always be assigned. In any case, it was
not assigned in favour of any third party rather it was by the father-in-law of Veena Gupta in her
favour, as he was getting old. It was in the family only. He further submitted that Special Leave
Petition bearing SLP(C) No. 5910 of 2014 filed by Rajmani Devi & Ors. against Veena Gupta,
respondent no.1 herein challenging the same judgment on the issue of default in payment of rent on
the part of original defendants was dismissed by this Court on 21.02.2014.
9. Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
DISCUSSION
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/180574598/ 3Indira Devi vs Veena Gupta on 4 July, 2023
10. The primary issue which requires consideration in the present appeal is as to whether the vendor
can assign the right contained in a sale deed to get the property registered back or the right being
personal cannot be assigned.
(1993) 2 SCC 740 (2003) 12 SCC 160 Civil Appeal No. 9833 of 2014
11. The contents of the documents placed on record would be relevant to appreciate the issue. The
relevant clauses in the conditional sale deed are extracted hereinbelow: -
“That the vendors after taking confident of the vendee about the right title of the
vendors and possession executed the conditional sale deed on valid consideration of
Rs.5,000/ {Rupees five thousands} only and handed over the full right title and
possession to the vendee St. Indira Devi having left no concern with the property. The
vendors were out of the purview of Land Calling Act.
That the conditional sale deed is being executed on condition that if the vendors
would return the full consideration money to the vendee by July 1984 then the
vendee would return the same by means of registered sale deed at the cost of the
vendors and the vendors fail to return the consideration money within the stipulated
time the vendee would be full owner of the property till then the vendee would
neither execute any deed of conveyance to others with respect to the land would
mortgage the land nor would became the guarantor over the land nor would take loan
over the land, if it would have been done it would be illegal. The vendee would also
neither change the physical feature of the house nor the vendee would be entitle to
pay the rent to the state of Bihar.
If the vendors intend to return the consideration money to the vendee within the stipulated period
the vendee would execute a sale deed in favour of the vendors (failing Civil Appeal No. 9833 of 2014
which/the vendors would deposit the full consideration money in the court and the right title of the
vendee would be seized and in that case the vendee would bear the cost of the damages. If the
vendee would be dispossessed from the afore said land or part thereof on account of some legal
complication the vendors and their legal heirs would be liable to pay the full consideration money -A
with damages to the vendee. The vendee would acquired full right title over the afore said land after
the expiry of stipulated period and the vendors would have no option or right there after to interfere
with respect to the right title and possession of the vendee and the vendee would have been on
liberty to mutate his name in place of vendors and utilize the land as per her choice if any
interference is made by the vendors or their heirs would be illegal by the court and the vendors
would be entitle to bear the cost and damages”.
(emphasis supplied)
12. The relevant clauses in the Gift Deed are extracted hereinbelow:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/180574598/ 4Indira Devi vs Veena Gupta on 4 July, 2023
“I, the executant, am in possession of the above-mentioned property. I am in old age
now and God knows when this life will come to an end. That beneficiary of this
document is the Potehu (daughter-in-law) of the executant. She takes care of me, the
executant and I am happy with her care. Therefore, I have decided to gift my entire
property to her and make her owner of my all the properties like me. ……..
Civil Appeal No. 9833 of 2014 Only some property, as mentioned at column No. 5, has been given to
Smt. Indira Devi through sale deed dated 5.8.1977. No other document regarding these properties
has been executed.
…… She can also take the possession of property sold to Indra Devi and Malti Devi by purchasing the
same from her. Now she will get all the rights which I was enjoying till date in respect of
above-mentioned property.”
13. The civil suit was filed by late Kishori Lal Sahu and Veena Gupta against Kaleshwar Prasad and
Indira Devi. The primary relief which has been pressed by the plaintiff is extracted below:-
“(a) A decree for specific performance of contract be passed in favour of the plaintiff
first party and the defendant first be directed to take (cid:129) 5000/- from the plaintiff first
party and the defendant second party be directed to execute and register a sale deed
with respect to the suit house detailed in Schedule-I below in favour of the plaintiff
first party and put the plaintiff first party in possession and on failure of the
defendants to do so, the court may be pleased to execute and register a sale deed in
favour of the plaintiff first party on behalf of defendant second party and a decree for
recovery of possession be passed and the plaintiff first party be put in possession by
delivery of possession through court by dispossessing the defendants or anybody else
Civil Appeal No. 9833 of 2014 whosoever be found in possession on behalf of the
defendant second party.”
14. As has already been noticed, the Trial Court as well as the first Appellate Court had dismissed the
suit whereas the High Court had reversed the findings and decreed the same. LEGAL POSITION
15. The issue was considered by this Court in T.M. Balakrishna Mudaliar (supra) wherein reference
was made to earlier judgment of Privy Council in Sakalaguna Nayudu v. Chinna Munuswami
Naykar5. This Court opined that the benefit of a contract of repurchase which did not show that it
was intended only for the benefit of the parties contracting, could be assigned. The option given to
repurchase the property sold would prima facie be assignable. Para 9 of the judgment is extracted
below:-
“9. The Privy Council in Sakalaguna Nayudu v. Chinna Munuswami Naykar has held
that the benefit of a contract of repurchase which did not show that it was intended
only for the benefit of the parties contracting, could be assigned and such contract is
enforceable. Beaumont, C.J. in AIR 1928 PC 174 Civil Appeal No. 9833 of 2014
Vishweshwar Narsabhatta Gaddada v. Durgappa Irappa Bhatkar6 held that both
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/180574598/ 5Indira Devi vs Veena Gupta on 4 July, 2023
under the common law as well as under Section 23(b) of the Specific Relief Act, 1877,
an option given to repurchase the property sold would prima facie be assignable,
though it might also be so worded as to show that it was to be personal to the grantee
and not assignable. On the particular facts of that case, it was held that the contract
was assignable. In Sinnakaruppa Gounder v. Karuppuswami Gounder7, it was held:
“In our view, generally speaking, the benefits of a contract of repurchase must be
assignable, unless the terms of the contract are such as to show that the right of
repurchase is personal to the vendor. In the latter case it will be for the person who
pleads that the contract is not enforceable, to show that the intention of the parties
thereto was that it was to be enforced only by the persons named therein and not by
the assignee.”
16. Again, the issue came up for consideration before this Court in Shyam Singh case
(supra), wherein judgments of the Privy Council in Sakalaguna Nayudu and this
Court in T.M. Balakrishna Mudaliar (supra) were referred to. It was a case in which a
conditional sale deed was registered with a right of repurchase. The conditions as
mentioned AIR 1940 Bom 339 : 42 BLR 653 : ILR 1940 Bom 674 AIR 1965 Mad 506 :
ILR (1965) 2 Mad 20 Civil Appeal No. 9833 of 2014 in the sale deed in the aforesaid
case, which were similar to the case in hand, are extracted below:-
“Whereas we, Daryao Singh, son of Hardeva, the first party and Surajmal, Peetam
and Babu, sons of Rati Ram, the second party, Jat, residents of Village Nala, Pargana
Kandhala, Tehsil Budhana, District Muzaffarnagar. Party 2 has executed a sale deed
today in favour of Party 1 for a sum of Rs 4900 in respect of 2 bighas 7 biswas of the
land of Khasra No. 95, bearing a rent of Rs 6.25 annually situate in Khata No. 331 of
Village Nala, Pargana Kandhala, Tehsil Budhana, District Muzaffarnagar, about
which it was agreed between the parties that if the second party paid the entire
consideration of the sale deed of Rs 4900 to the first party or to the heirs of the first
party within ten years from today then in that situation the first party will reconvey
the aforesaid land by sale deed in favour of the second party without any objection. If
for any reason the first party does not execute a sale deed in favour of the second
party, after five years but within ten years from the date of sale deed dated 4-2-1971,
then the second party will have a right to deposit the entire consideration of Rs 4900
in the civil court and get the sale deed executed by the court, the first party will have
no objection. The present agreement will be binding upon the parties and the heirs of
the parties. Therefore, these few comments by way of agreement of reconveyance of
sale within ten years are being written so that this document may be used when
necessary. After the limitation of ten years Civil Appeal No. 9833 of 2014 the second
party will have no right at all to get released the aforesaid from Party 1.” (emphasis
supplied)
17. In Shyam Singh’s case (supra) the party having right to repurchase the land sold
the rights to a third party for a consideration of (cid:129) 19,000/- by way of a registered
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/180574598/ 6Indira Devi vs Veena Gupta on 4 July, 2023
document. The right to repurchase was available to him on payment of (cid:129) 4900/-. All
the courts below had opined that if there is no clause in the sale deed permitting
assignment of right to repurchase, the same could not be transferred. When the
matter came up before this Court, the question under consideration was whether
such a prohibition against assignment or transfer can be read into the document by
implication. The opinion expressed was that a long period of ten years was fixed for
obtaining re-conveyance, no implied prohibition of transfer or assignment can be
inferred in the document keeping in view the provisions of Section 15(b) of the
Specific Relief Act. The relevant paras of the judgment are extracted below:-
“13. In our considered opinion, in the absence of any words or expressions in the
documents indicating prohibition on assignment or transfer of right of repurchase
and in the face of clear provisions of Section 15(b) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, an
implied prohibition cannot be read into the terms of the Civil Appeal No. 9833 of
2014 documents. Merely because in the documents, there is mention of “heirs” of the
contracting parties but not their “assignees” or “transferees”, the legal right of
assignment available to the benefit of original contracting party under Section 15(b)
of the Act cannot be denied to it.
14. We are fortified in our view by two direct decisions of this Court rendered in
somewhat similar circumstances with documents contemporaneously executed for
sale and repurchase with comparable stipulations. See T.M. Balakrishna Mudaliar v.
M. Satyanarayana Rao (supra) and Habiba Khatoon v. Ubaidul Huq8”.
15. In the case of Habiba Khatoon [(1997) 7 SCC 452] taking stock of earlier decisions
of this Court, the Privy Council and the High Court of Bombay, the law on the
present-contested issue was explained to uphold the right of repurchase of the
original contracting party thus:
“We may in this connection also usefully refer to a decision of this Court in the case of
T.M. Balakrishna Mudaliar v. M. Satyanarayana Rao [(1993) 2 SCC 740].
Considering the provisions of Section 15(b) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 a Bench of
two learned Judges of this Court speaking through Kasliwal, J., endorsed (in para 10
of the SCC) the statement of law flowing from the decision of Sakalaguna (1997) 7
SCC 452 Civil Appeal No. 9833 of 2014 Nayudu [Sakalaguna Nayudu v. Chinna
Munuswami Nayakar, AIR 1928 PC 174 : 55 IA 243 : 32 CWN 850] as well as the
decision of Beaumont, C.J., speaking for the Bombay High Court in the case of
Vishweshwar Narsabhatta Gaddada v. Durgappa Irappa Bhatkar [AIR 1940 Bom 339
: 42 Bom LR 653 :
ILR 1940 Bom 674] . The statement of law which got imprimatur of this Court in para 9 of the
Report runs as follows:
‘The Privy Council in Sakalaguna
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/180574598/ 7Indira Devi vs Veena Gupta on 4 July, 2023
Nayudu v. Chinna Munuswami
Nayakar [Sakalaguna Nayudu v. Chinna
Munuswami Nayakar, AIR 1928 PC 174 : 55 IA 243 : 32 CWN 850] has held that the benefit of a
contract of repurchase which did not show that it was intended only for the benefit of the parties
contracting, could be assigned and such contract is enforceable. Beaumont, C.J.
in Vishweshwar Narsabhatta Gaddada v. Durgappa Irappa Bhatkar [AIR 1940 Bom 339 : 42 Bom
LR 653 : ILR 1940 Bom 674] held that both under the common law as well as under Section 23(b) of
the Specific Relief Act, 1877, an option given to repurchase the property sold would prima facie be
assignable, though it might also be so worded as to show that it was to be personal to the grantee
and not assignable. On the particular facts of that case, it was held that Civil Appeal No. 9833 of
2014 the contract was assignable. In Sinnakaruppa Gounder v. M. Karuppuswami Gounder [AIR
1965 Mad 506 : ILR (1965) 2 Mad 20 :
In our view, generally speaking, the benefits of a contract of repurchase must be
assignable, unless the terms of the contract are such as to show that the right of
repurchase is personal to the vendor. In the latter case it will be for the person who
pleads that the contract is not enforceable, to show that the intention of the parties
thereto was that it was to be enforced only by the persons named therein and not by
the assignee.
16. From the statement of law as has been approved and followed by this Court in two decisions in
Habiba Khatoon [(1997) 7 SCC 452] and T.M. Balakrishna Mudaliar [(1993) 2 SCC 740] , unless the
contents of the document in question and evidence in relation thereto are so clear to infer a
prohibition against assignment or transfer, the right of repurchase has to be held to be assignable or
transferable and cannot be treated as personal to the contracting parties.
17. On a very unsubstantial ground that the document in question makes a mention only of “parties”
and their “heirs” and not “assignees” or “transferees”, it Civil Appeal No. 9833 of 2014 cannot be
held that the right of repurchase was not assignable. In our considered opinion, therefore, the courts
below were in error in construing the document in question in a manner to infer an implied
prohibition against assignment and transfer.” (emphasis supplied)
18. It may be noticed that the earlier two judgments of this Court in T.M. Balakrishna (supra) and
Habiba Khatoon (supra) were cited with approval. Right of repurchase was held to be assignable or
transferable and cannot be treated as personal to the contracting parties.
19. To be fair to the appellant, we refer to the judgments cited by learned counsel for the appellant,
which do not support his case. In Bhoju Mandal and Ors’s case (supra), the issue under
consideration was as to whether the document in question there was a mortgage or a sale with
condition of repurchase. The same was decided on construction of the clauses in the document. It
was in that reference this Court observed that there is a distinction between the said two concepts.
The issue can be resolved only by ascertaining the intention of the parties on a consideration of the
contents of the documents. The specific issue under consideration therein was not as to whether the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/180574598/ 8Indira Devi vs Veena Gupta on 4 July, 2023
right to repurchase was personal to the vendor or the same could be Civil Appeal No. 9833 of 2014
assigned or not. The judgment of the High Court opining that the document therein was not a
mortgage but a sale with a condition of repurchase was upheld.
20. In Kapilaben and Ors.’s case (supra) this Court had considered that assignment of a contract
might result in transfer of either rights or obligations thereunder. The transfer of obligations is not
possible without the consent of the other party. The transfer of right is permissible except in cases
where the contract is of personal nature. Relevant paras thereof are extracted below:-
“24. It is well-settled that the term “representative- in-interest” includes the assignee
of a contractual interest. Though the provisions of the Contract Act do not
particularly deal with the assignability of contracts, this Court has opined time and
again that a party to a contract cannot assign their obligations/liabilities without the
consent of the other party. A Constitution Bench of this Court in Khardah Co. Ltd. v.
Raymon & Co. (India) (P) Ltd.9, has laid out this principle as follows :
“19. … An assignment of a contract might result by transfer either of the rights or of
the obligations thereunder. But there is a well-recognised distinction between these
two classes of assignments. As a rule obligations under a contract cannot be assigned
except AIR 1962 SC 1810 Civil Appeal No. 9833 of 2014 with the consent of the
promisee, and when such consent is given, it is really a novation resulting in
substitution of liabilities. On the other hand, rights under a contract are assignable
unless the contract is personal in its nature or the rights are incapable of assignment
either under the law or under an agreement between the parties.” x x x x
27. Even in a case of assignment of rights simpliciter, such assignment would
necessarily require the consent of the other party to the contract if it is of a “personal
nature”. This is elucidated by the learned authors Pollock and Mulla in their
commentary on The Indian Contract and Specific Relief Acts (R. Yashod Vardhan,
and Chitra Narayan, Eds., 15th Edn., Vol. I) at p. 730:
“A contract which is such that the promisor must perform it in person viz. involving
personal considerations or personal skill or qualifications (such as his credit), are by
their nature not assignable. The benefit of contract is assignable in ‘cases where it can
make no difference to the person on whom the obligation lies to which of two persons
he is to discharge it’. The contractual rights for the payment of money or to building
work, for e.g. do not involve personal considerations.” (emphasis supplied) Civil
Appeal No. 9833 of 2014
21. It can be summed up from the aforesaid judgments that the condition of right to
repurchase in sale deed will not be personal to the vendor unless the terms in the
documents specifically state so. Such a right can always be assigned and the contract
containing such condition shall be enforceable. The only exception being that such a
right should not be personal in nature. The assignment of obligations in a document
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/180574598/ 9Indira Devi vs Veena Gupta on 4 July, 2023
is not possible without the consent of the other party.
No implied prohibition of transfer or assignment can be inferred in a document. The benefit of
contract is assignable in cases where it does not make any difference to the person on whom the
obligations lies, to which of two persons he is to discharge.
22. If the facts of the case in hand are considered, we do not find that there is any term in the
conditional Sale Deed which debars its assignment to any other person. The clause only mentions
regarding right of repurchase. The option is given to the vendors with the obligations on the vendee.
The right to repurchase in the present case has been assigned by Kishori Lal Sahu (now deceased) in
favour of respondent no.1 who is none else than his daughter-in-law to whom other properties have
also been gifted.
23. Even the argument raised by learned counsel for the appellant that such an assignment of a right
cannot be treated as a gift Civil Appeal No. 9833 of 2014 as consideration money is involved, is also
noticed and rejected for the reason that the executor of the Gift Deed i.e Kishori Lal Sahu (now
deceased) had transferred his right to repurchase the property in favour of respondent no.1. That
right could always be assigned by him with whatever conditions attached to it. Further in the suit
filed, he was also a plaintiff, who died later.
24. For the reasons mentioned above, we do not find any error in the judgment of the High Court.
The present appeal is accordingly dismissed. There is no order as to costs.
