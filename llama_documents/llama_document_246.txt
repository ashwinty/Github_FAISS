ORDER
The petitioner is a company involving in the production of captive power generation. The raw
material for the aforesaid purpose is the natural gas. Agreements have been entered into between
the petitioner and the first respondent. These agreements include a power supply agreement with its
supplementaries. The arrangement between the parties is to the effect that the petitioner shall
supply a specified power at a price, which is less than Rs.0.47 paise than the one supplied by the
Tamil Nadu Electricity Board. The first respondent has also become a shareholder in the petitioner
company. Apart from these arrangements, two Memorandum of Understanding were entered into
between the parties for the supply of 1 and 0.5 MW respectively with the price fixed at Rs.7.25 per
KWH as against the earlier one of Rs.3.31 per KWH.

2. The following are the relevant Clauses in the Power Supply Agreement dated 11.03.2004 signed
between the parties.
I.1.4 (cid:19)TNEB Tariff(cid:20) shall mean the base tariff for one Kwh of electrical power charged by TNEB and
the Electricity Tax payable on such tariff by high tension consumers but shall not include any
demand charges, peak hour charges and any other additional charges levied now or in future by
TNEB.
II.1.15 In case of any shut down or repair, shall endeavor in its utmost competence to replace or
restore the power plant to its normal working condition with the greatest urgency and least possible
delay. However, if there is a delay of more than 30 days in restoring the power plant to its normal
working condition and consequently KGPL is unable to supply the contracted demand, KGPL shall
pay to the CONSUMER, liquidated damages to the extent of loss of electrical power cost reduction
as stipulated in Article III.1.5 of this Agreement.
II.1.16 Shall ensure and own all risks and liabilities in respect of the power plant and/or arising out
of and resulting from its use/operation, maintenance and storage and for accidents causing injuries
to or death of any person whether he is the agent or servant or employee of KGPL or third party(ies)
and the CONSUMER shall have no liability attached thereto.
II.1.17 KGPL alone shall have absolute liability under all applicable laws and rules in respect of work
done, directly or indirectly, through their sub contractors or agents towards use, operation,
maintenance and storage of the power plant.
II.1.18. Shall undertake all liability/ responsibility and shall be liable for all costs, demands, claims,
losses, damages or expenses which may be incurred by or made on the CONSUMER and arising
from the transaction hereby entered into and/or the installation use, maintenance or operation of
the power plant or any of its failure to operate or to perform or any other cause whatsoever and
howsoever arising.(cid:20)
3.These Clauses come under Article II dealing with the obligations and undertakings. As per Clause
II.1.15, in the event of inability to supply of contract demand, the petitioner has to pay to the first
respondent the liquidated damages to the extent of loss of electrical power as stipulated under
Article III.1.5 of the agreement. Under Clause II.1.18, the petitioner undertakes all damages and
expenses incurred on the first respondent, when it occurred at the instance of the petitioner.
4. Article III deals with sales and purchase of energy price payable. The relevant Article III.1.5 is as
follows.
(cid:19)III.1.5 In case KGPL is unable to supply the electrical power to the extent of contracted demand on
firm basis the Consumer may request the KGPL to effect such supply by suitably amending the
delivery schedule. On the other hand, if KGPL is still unable to meet its delivery commitments, then
KGPL shall pay the fixed difference of Re.0.47 (Forty seven paise only) per unit to the CONSUMER
for such quantity of power not supplied by KGPL as against the contracted demand/revised delivery
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168946339/ 2Kaveri Gas Power Limited vs M/S Madura Coats Pvt. Ltd on 22 December, 2014
schedule on firm basis during a contract year. The claim, if in order and payable, shall be settled by
KGPL within 30 days of receipt of the claim from the Consumer.(cid:20) This Article also speaks about the
inability of the petitioner to supply electrical power to the extent of contracted demand on firm basis
resulting in payment of liquidated damages at a fixed price of Rs.0.47 paise per unit.
5. The petitioner did not make the supply as per the agreement admittedly. As a consequence to
that, the first respondent was made to purchase the power from outside to run its unit at a higher
price. As the petitioner failed to make the supply despite the request made by the first respondent,
there was also an excess drawal from the grid beyond the quota allotted by the Tamil Nadu
Electricity Board (hereinafter referred to (cid:19)TNEB(cid:20)), in turn, resulted in the levy of penalty. The first
respondent also used diesel gen set.
6. The aforesaid process adopted incurred huge loss to the first respondent. Thus, the first
respondent invoked the arbitration clause making various claims against the petitioner. The claims
were made on the basis of liquidated damages.
7. The Tribunal, by an exhaustive and extensive award granted part of the claims in favour of the
first respondent. Findings were given that the failure to make the supply was not borne out of
inability but otherwise. In the process, the first respondent did incur the loss. It was not correct to
state that there was insufficient supply of gas. The over drawal made by the first respondent was due
to the refusal of the petitioner in making the supply as the grid being the same. Article III.1.5 of the
power supply agreement does not apply to the case on hand. So is the case of Article II.1.15.
Therefore, it is a case of non-supply not falling under Article II.1.15 and III.1.5 of the power supply
agreement. The fact that the first respondent became the shareholder of the petitioner will not debar
it from making the claim. Hence, the case on hand would come under Article II.1.18. The petitioner
has deliberately diverted the power produced to the third party for sale at a higher rate. The first
respondent would not be in a position to know the non-supply till the bill was raised by the TNEB.
There is no material to hold that the first respondent did not even utilise the contract and power
from the TNEB. No plea towards mitigating the loss was taken nor there is any material on the part
of the petitioner to that effect. The Audit Report of the TNEB would show the excess energy drawn.
The very fact that the first respondent entered into two Memorandum of Understandings with the
petitioner would show that the cheaper power from the TNEB was not available. The petitioner did
admit the requirement of the first respondent. The documents filed by the first respondent would
show the expenses incurred in generating the electricity. However, it is to be noted that the Tribunal
did not take into consideration of two enhancements made in the tariff by the TNEB. Thus, a sum of
Rs.1,05,87,121/- has been wrongly awarded. This factual error has been fairly admitted by the first
respondent.
8. Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and the learned Senior Counsel appearing
for the first respondent and perused the documents and written submissions.
9. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would submit that the first respondent did not
prove that it had actually required the power as per the contract. There cannot be any higher
liquidated damages than the one provided under Article III.1.15 and II.1.5 of the Power Supply
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168946339/ 3Kaveri Gas Power Limited vs M/S Madura Coats Pvt. Ltd on 22 December, 2014
Agreement. The burden to prove the loss was wrongly cast on the petitioner. The audit slips ought
not to have been relied upon by the Tribunal. The first respondent did not establish the usage of
TNEB quota, overdrawal, payment of penalty and the loss. The materials produced for the purchase
of power from outside and usage of diesel for operating through gen set are not sufficient. The
monthly invoices raised by the TNEB was not produced. The first respondent did not establish the
steps taken to mitigate against the plausible loss. The tariff payable by way of liquidated damages
was fixed by taking into consideration of the price fixed under the Memorandum of Understandings,
which is not sustainable in law. In support of his contention, the learned counsel has made reliance
on the following judgments.
1.ASSOCIATE BUILDERS V. DELHI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY (2015) 3 Supreme Court Cases
49);
2.TITANIUM TANTALUM PRODUCTS LTD., V. SHRIRAM ALKALI AND CHEMICALS

11 Supreme Court Cases 181); and
9.KAILASH NATH ASSOCIATES V. DELHI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY AND ANOTHER
((2015) 4 Supreme Court Cases 136.
10. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the first respondent would submit that admittedly,
supply was not made as agreed. The factual finding is to the effect that the non supply was deliberate
to augment more revenue from the third party. The permission given by the TNEB was qualified .
Thus, even the said permission was violated. The overdrawal is solely attributable to the petitioner.
The power was drawn from the said grid and therefore, the first respondent was not aware as to
whether it comes from the petitioner or TNEB. The first respondent was kept in tenterhooks all the
time though the methodology were adopted in view of the failure of the petitioner to provide
electricity. The first respondent was forced to adopt the other modes to secure electricity. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/168946339/ 4Kaveri Gas Power Limited vs M/S Madura Coats Pvt. Ltd on 22 December, 2014
Tribunal has considered all the materials while assessing the loss. Section 73 of the Indian Contract
Act, 1872 has to be read with Section 74. As rightly held by the Tribunal, we are not dealing with the
case of the deliberate supply but deliberate denial. Therefore, Article II.1.15 and III.1.5 do not have
any application as against Article II.1.18. The Tariff was fixed as it was the one agreed by the parties.
It was even less than the one otherwise payable to TNEB. In any case, the damages involved four
periods and therefore, different methodologies were adopted to secure power. The issue regarding
the alleged non consumption was raised only after the completion of the evidence. The production
was on the increase contrary to the statement made by the petitioner. Similarly placed persons
invoked Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, and obtained the orders and got the
supply. It is not, as if, the Tribunal has awarded all the claims. In fact, the claims made under several
heads were granted only partially. As the award was an exhaustive and elaborate one, no
interference is required. However, the learned Senior Counsel fairly stated that the award can be
modified by reducing a sum of Rs.1,05,87,121/-. The decision relied on by the learned Senior
Counsel is as follows:
(1) STEEL AUTHORITY OF INDIA LIMITED V. GUPTA BROTHER STEEL TUBES LIMITED
((2008) 10 Supreme Court Cases 63).
11. The fundamental and basic facts are not in dispute with respect to the agreements and
communication between the parties. Thus, the liability to supply cannot be denied. On this, the
Tribunal has rendered a factual finding that this is not a case of supply not made due to inability but
a deliberate refusal to augment higher revenue through the sale in favour of third parties. The
Tribunal has also found that it was not correct to state that there was inadequate of raw materials
viz., gas for the power production. These findings being factual cannot be assailed and therefore,
they formed the foundation on the other issues.
12. Interpreting an agreement lies within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The Tribunal interpreted
Article III.1.15 and II.1.5 and III.1.18 correctly on the factual foundation. Thus, there is no difficulty
in upholding the reasoning of the Tribunal with respect to the liquidated damages payable.
13. Mitigating the loss was never pleaded but raised belatedly. A mitigation has to be seen on a fact
situation. Different methods were adopted by the first respondent due to the contingencies created
by the circumstances and the petitioner. The over drawal happened because of the petitioner's
refusal to supply. The audit slips were taken note of for awarding part of the claim.
14. Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, has to be read with Section 74. Section 73 of the said
Act speaks about the knowledge of the party on the consequence of breach leading to the situation
resulting in damages. As rightly submitted by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the first
respondent, Illustration (cid:19)A(cid:20) to Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, would govern the case.
Similarly, Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, does not have an application when a party
responsible for the breach does it deliberately to get financial gain. Otherwise, it might lead the
situation where despite payment of liquidated damages under Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act,
1872, a party, who is responsible for the breach would benefit more. In such view of the matter, the
statement of law dealt with by the Tribunal required to be confirmed.

15. Coming to the materials produced while claiming damages, the Tribunal has considered them at
length while passing an Award. The price govern by the Memorandum of Understanding was taken,
being a reasonable one. The penalty was forced upon the first respondent on the deliberate refusal of
the petitioner to supply. The first respondent was made to purchase power from outside at a higher
price and use diesel gen set also for the aforesaid reason. These steps were taken by the first
respondent at different periods warranted by the continued failure of the petitioner to supply. It is
also to be noted that the petitioner did make its supply to other similarly placed persons, who have
obtained orders from this Court under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. When
once the Tribunal gives a finding on analysing the materials paced before it, in coming to the
quantum of compensation, this Court is not expected to interfere with it under Section 34 of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The award was passed on a consideration of the materials
produced. The requirement is not in dispute as admitted by the petitioner itself. After all, the
petitioner is bound to make good the loss suffered by the first respondent for its deliberate act. The
first respondent, being the shareholder, can never be a factor to deny the relief sought for. There is
nothing wrong in taking note of the evidence in the form of balance sheet, auditor's report and audit
slips. After all, as stated earlier, it is not, as if, all the claims were allowed. In fact, the Tribunal did
not agree with some of the claims by declining to accept the materials produced.
16. Though the learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon few decisions, this Court is not dealing
with the ratio laid down as being unnecessary and not relevant to this case. After all there is no
doubt on the legal statements made. In such view of the matter, this Court does not find any error in
the award passed warranting interference and accordingly, the original petition stands dismissed.
However, in view of the fair submission made by the learned Senior Counsel for the first respondent,
taking note of the error committed, not taking note of two enhancements made by the TNEB, a sum
of Rs.1,05,87,121/- is accordingly deducted from the award passed. No costs.
