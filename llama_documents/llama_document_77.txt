The plaintiff- appellant instituted an Original Suit No.35 of 1985 before the learned Trial Court,
praying for cancellation the sale deed dated 25.11.1974. Plaintiff's case is that he and defendant nos.
2, 3 and 4 belong to the same family, Shajra whereof is attached with the plaint; that the plaintiff
and defendant nos. 2, 3 and 4 lived jointly till 1960; that the moveable and immoveable properties
were divided between the parties in 1960 and they are accordingly in possession; that the plaintiff
was entitled to half share and defendant nos. 2 to 4 were entitled to half share; that there was a plot
in Mohalla Jhandapura Mauranipur area 20400 sq.ft. which was also partitioned in 1960; that the
plaintiff got half of the same and the defendant nos.2 to 4 also got half area of the same; that the
defendant nos. 2 and 3 sold an area of 69 feet x 42 feet in favour of Dayaram Kachi in 1965; that an
area of 7302 sq. ft. remained but defendant nos. 2 and 3 have sold 17200 sq. ft. in favour of
defendant no.1 on 25.11.1974 including the land belonging to the plaintiff; that the defendant nos. 2
and 3 have no right to sell out the land of the plaintiff without his consent and even without
partition the defendant could have not sold more than half of their share in the land.
The defendant nos. 2 to 4 did not filed any written statement in the suit, despite service of notice.
One Sunder Lal submitted written statement on behalf of defendant no.1, stating that the in the
partition in 1960, the defendant nos. 2 to 4 got 20400 sq.ft. of land; that the suit is barred by
limitation and Section-34 of the Specific Relief Act and the defendant no.1 is entitled to protection of
Section-41 of the Transfer of Property Act as he is bonafide purchaser for value without notice.
The learned trial court on the basis of the pleadings of the parties framed the following issues, (1).
Whether the defendant nos.2 and 3 did not had right to execute the sale deed of the disputed
property?
(2). Whether the plaintiff is the owner of the disputed property and has possession over the same?
(3). Whether the suit of the plaintiff is barred by time?
(4). Whether the suit of the plaintiff is barred by Section-34 of Specific Relief Act?
(5). Whether the suit of the plaintiff is bad for non joinder of necessary parties?
(6). Whether the defendants are bonafide purchaser for value without notice?
(7). To what relief is the plaintiff entitled to?
(8). Whether the Court Fees paid in the suit is insufficient?
The trial court first of all decided the issue no.8 in negative holding that the court fees is paid
sufficient.
Regarding issue no.1, the trial court held that the defendant nos. 2 and 3 had right to execute the
disputed sale deed but the question remains whether they executed the sale deed in excess of their
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79945213/ 2Prem Narain vs Mahabir Jain on 7 May, 2018
share or not.
Issue no.2, regarding ownership and possession of the plaintiff over the land in dispute, the trial
court recorded the finding that the defendant nos. 2 and 3 did not execute the sale deed in excess of
their share in favour of defendant no.1.
Issue no.4 was decided against the plaintiff holding that his suit is barred by Section-34 of the
Specific Relief Act since he has not prayed for any consequential relief of possession. It is not clear
who is in possession over the land in dispute.
Issue no.5 was decided in favour of the plaintiff that there is no defect in the suit of non-joinder of
the necessary party.
Issue no.6 was decided holding that the defendant no.1 was not the bonafide purchaser for value
without notice and they can not be presumed of not having knowledge of dispute regarding the title
of the property.
Issue no.3 regarding limitation was decided by the trial court holding that the sale deed was
executed on 25.11.1974 and suit was filed on 22.09.1978. The registration of the sale deed was done
on 21.04.1977. The limitation of 3 years for instituting suit for cancellation of sale deed, as per
Article -59 of the Limitation Act, will be reckoned from the date of knowledge of the execution of the
sale deed which was in January, 1975. The plaintiff has admitted this date of knowledge in his
written statement and that he filed his objection in the Registry Office thereafter. Relying upon
Section-47 of the Registration Act, the trial court held that the suit of the plaintiff is beyond 3 years
period of limitation and therefore barred by time.
The learned trial court by the judgment and decree dated 16.05.1986 dismissed the suit of the
plaintiff. A Civil Appeal No.106 of 1986 was preferred by the plaintiff before the lower appellate
court which did not framed any issue of determination and decided the issue of limitation, against
the plaintiff. The finding of the trial court regarding the defendant no.1 not being bonafide
purchaser for value without notice was confirmed. Suit was held as not barred by non-joinder of
necessary party and the theory of partition of the property set up by the plaintiff was accepted as
correct and finding was recorded that the disputed sale deed is invalid to the extent, it includes the
share of the plaintiff's land. The finding of the trial court was not set aside regarding this issue.
However the appeal of the plaintiff was dismissed on the ground of being barred by limitation.
Aggrieved by the Judgments and Decrees of both the courts below, this second appeal has been
preferred by the plaintiff.
The learned counsel for the appellant has argued that the lower court has reversed all the findings of
the trial court recorded against the plaintiff, except the finding of the suit being barred by limitation
and therefore the only issue for determination in the second appeal is whether the suit of the
plaintiff was barred bye law of limitation or not.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79945213/ 3Prem Narain vs Mahabir Jain on 7 May, 2018
This appeal was admitted on 06.02.1990 on the following substantial questions of law, (1). Whether
the point of limitation for the decree of cancellation of transfer deed, should commence from the
date of knowledge, starting from the date of registration of the document or from the date of
execution of the document?
The learned counsel for the appellant has argued that the findings of the court below suffers from
manifest error of law since as per Section-54 of the Transfer of Property Act sale of tangible
immoveable property can only be made by a registered instrument. He has further relied upon
Section-60 and 61 of the Registration Act, 1908 which provide for the manner of endorsement of a
document and when and how the registration of the document shall be deemed to be complete. His
submission is that unless the registration of the documents gets completed and the document is
returned to the person who presented the same for registration it will have no legal effect regarding
the creation or extinguishment of title. He has submitted that w.e.f., 01.01.1977 the sale deed
executed in the State of U.P. became compulsorily registerable. Therefore, after the registration of
the disputed sale deed on 21.04.1977 it got legal force and sanctity.
It has been argued further by the learned Counsel for appellant that Section-47 of the Registration
Act only provides for the effect of Registration of the document. A joint reading of Sections, 47, 48
and 49 of the Registration Act, makes it clear that the instrument which purports to transfer title of
the property is required to be registered, the title does not passes till the registration is affected. The
registration by itself does not creates a new title. It only affirms a title that has been created by the
deed. The title is complete and the effect of registration is to make it unquestionable and absolute.
He has clarified that under Section 49 (c) of the Registration Act, provides that an unregistered
document affecting immoveable property and required to be registered under the Registration Act
or the Transfer of Property Act can not be received in evidence of any transaction affecting such
property or conferring such power, unless it is registered. The natural corollary of the section is that
the suit for cancellation of such a sale deed will not lie before the competent court, unless the
document is registered as per the requirements of law. The suit of the plaintiff would not have been
maintainable unless the disputed sale deed got registered and acquired legal force. Since the
cancellation of the document was prayed, it was required to be produced in evidence and without
registration it could not have been received in evidence due to bar of Section 49 (c) of the
Registration Act. His argument is that the starting point for limitation for filing suit for the plaintiff
was the date when the document got registered i.e., 21.04.1977 since prior to that date, the
admissibility of the sale deed was barred by law aforesaid. The Apex Court in the case of Mst. Kirpal
Kaur Vs. Bachan Singh, AIR 1958 SC 199, held that to admit and unregistered document to prove
the nature of possession in suit would really amount to getting round the statutory bar imposed by
Section-49 of the Registration Act. The only exception to this Rule is the unregistered agreement to
sale in the suit for Specific Performance of Contract of Sale, where the unregistered agreement to
sale can be received in evidence by virtue of only proviso to Section-49 of the Registration Act.
The Counsel for the appellant has relied upon the Judgment of in case of Nabir Ganai Vs. Mohd.
Ismail Ganai, AIR 1960 J & K 112, wherein it was held that as between parties, registered document
takes effect from, the date of its execution but as between third parties it takes effect from the date of
registration. He has contended that since the sale deed was executed in favour of third party,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79945213/ 4Prem Narain vs Mahabir Jain on 7 May, 2018
therefore the starting point of limitation for instituting the suit for the plaintiff was the date of
registration of the document i.e., 21.04.1977.
Further reliance has been placed on paragraph no. 33 of the Judgment of Chaturbhuj Sharma Vs.
Durga Dayal, 1974 Law Suit (All) 218 (DB) (LB): 1976 AIR (All), as follows:-
33. To avoid the possibility of any misunderstanding it may be mentioned that
departure from the scope of Section 47, Registration Act may be made in exceptional
cases involving a question of limitation but not where the effect of the document and
the rights of the transferor and the transferee have to be determined In such a case
Section 47 must be interpreted as it is, that is, no restrictions not contemplated by the
section be imposed.
Lastly reliance has been placed on paragraph nos. 5, 6, 7, 8, 17,18,19 and 20 of the Judgment of the
Apex Court in the case of Ram Saran Lal and others Vs. Mst. Domini Kuer and others,
MANU/SC/0280/1961: AIR 1961 SC 1747, as follows:-
5. The Mohammedan law of preemption is stated in Mulla's Principles of
Mohammedan law in these terms: "The right of preemption arises only out of a valid,
complete and bona fide sale." This statement of the law is accepted by both the
parties and there is no question that it is not correct. There is furthermore no dispute
that the sale to the respondent purchaser was valid and bona fide. It is also agreed
that one of the requisites before the right of pre- emption can be exercised is the
preliminary demand by the preemptor and that such demand must be made after the
completion of the sale. The case has been argued before us on behalf of the appellants
on the basis that the sale was governed by the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. We will
also proceed on that basis.
6. Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act provides that sale of tangible immovable
property of the value of rupees 100 and upwards, which the house with which we are
concerned is, can be made only by a registered instrument. Section 3 of this Act
defines " registered" as registered under the law for the time being in force regulating
the registration of documents. This, in the present case, means the Regis- tration Act
of 1908. It is not in dispute that the registration under the Registration Act is not
complete till the document to be registered has been, copied out in the records of the
Registration Office as provided in s. 61 of that Act. It was therefore con. tended in the
High Court that when a sale had to be made by a registered instrument it became
complete only on the instrument of sale being copied in the books of the Registration
Office. The High Court accepted this view and held that the sale in the pre- sent case,
therefore, became complete on the completion of the registration of the instrument of
sale which was done on February 9, 1946 when the instrument was copied out in the
books of the Registration Office. In this view of the matter, the High Court came to
the conclusion that the appellants were not entitled to enforce their right of
preemption because they had not made the preliminary demand after the completion
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79945213/ 5Prem Narain vs Mahabir Jain on 7 May, 2018
of the sale as the law required them to do, but before, that is, on February 2, 1946.
7. In answer to this view of the High Court, the learned Attorney-General appearing
for the appellants says that the High Court overlooked s. 47 of the Registration Act
the effect of which was to make a registered document operate from the time from
which it would have commenced to operate if no registration thereof had been
required and not from the time of its registration. His contention is that once a
document is registered, as the deed of sale in this case was, it begins to operate from
the time it would have otherwise operated and therefore, the position in this case is
that the sale became operative and hence complete on January 31, 1946. The learned
Attorney-General further contends that the proper construction of the deed of sale
was that it became operative from the day it was executed and that if it was not so, it
was not a sale but could only be an agreement to sell in which latter case his clients,
though this present suit might fail, would be entitled, if they so desired, to enforce
their right of preemption when the sale was completed in pursuance of that
agreement. As authority in support of his contention that in view of s. 47 of the
Registration Act the sale in the present case must be deemed to have been completed
on the day the instrument was executed, the learned Attorney-General relied on
Bindeshri v. Somnath Bhadry (1) and Gopal Ram v. Lachmi Misir (2).(1) A.I.R. (1916)
All. 199. (2) A.I.R. (1926) All. 549.
8. We do not think that the learned Attorney-General's contention is well founded.
We will assume that the learned Attorney-General's construction of the instrument of
sale that the property was intended to pass under it on the date of the instrument is
correct. Section 47 of the Registration Act does not, however, say when a sale would
be deemed to be complete. It only permits a document when registered, to operate
from a certain date which may be earlier than the date when it was registered. The
object of this section is to decide which of two or more registered instruments in
respect of the same property is to have A effect. The section applies to a document
only after it has been registered. It has nothing to do with the completion of the
registration and therefore nothing to do with the completion of a sale, when the
instrument is one of sale. A sale which is admittedly not completed until the
registration of the instrument of sale is completed, cannot be said to have been
completed earlier because by virtue of s. 47 the instrument by which it is effected,
after it has been registered, commences to operate from an earlier date. Therefore we
do not think that the sale in this case can be said, in view of s. 47, to have been
completed on January 31, 1946. The view that we have taken of s. 47 of the
Registration Act seems to have been taken in Tilakdhari Singh v. Gour Narain A.I.R
(1921) Pat.150. We believe that the same view was expressed in Nareshchandra Datta
v. Gireeshchandra Das I.L.R (1935).62 Cal. 979 and Gobardhan Bar v. Guna Dhar Bar
(I.L.R (1940) II Cal.270.).
17. Turning now to the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, in the case of a sale
of immovable property of the value of Rs. 100 or over (as in the case before us) s. 54
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79945213/ 6Prem Narain vs Mahabir Jain on 7 May, 2018
of the Act enacts that it could be effected only by a registered instrument; sale itself
being defined as "transfer of ownership in exchange for a price paid or promised or
part paid and part promised". In other words, the essence of a transaction of sale
consists in the transfer of ownership and this transfer has to be effected by "a
registered instrument". The Transfer of Property Act while prescribing the formalities
of writing and Registration, does not itself determine the point of time when a sale
becomes complete. "Registered" under the Transfer (1) I.L.R. 16 All. 344. (2) [1961] 1
S.C.R. 248 of Property Act means: "registered under the law for the time being in
force regulating the registration of documents" (s. 3). When one turns to the
Registration Act, provision is made, inter alia for the time within which after its
execution a document could be presented for registration, the persons who could so
present, the office in which the document could validly be presented and registration
effected and sub-Part B of Part 11 starting from s. 58 deals with the procedure on
admitting documents to registration.
Section 60(1) enacts:
"After such of the provisions of sections 34, 35, 58 and 59 as apply to any document
presented for registration have been complied with, the registering officer shall
endorse thereon a certificate containing the word registered', together with the
number and page of the book in which the document has been copied."
and s. 61 which follows makes provision for the copying of documents in Public registers from which
the word "registration" is derived and enacts:
"61. (1). The endorsements and certificate referred to and mentioned in sections 59
and 60 shall thereupon be copied into the margin of the Register book, and the copy
of the map or plan (if any) mentioned in section 21 shall be filed in Book No. 1.
(2)The registration of the document shall thereupon be deemed complete, and the
document shall then be returned to the person who presented the same for
registration, or to such other person (if any) as he has nominated in writing in that
behalf on the receipt mentioned in section 52."
18. Much reliance has been placed by learned Counsel for the respondent and, indeed, in the
judgment of the High Court, on the words the "registration of the document shall thereupon be
deemed complete" occurring in sub-s. (2) of s. 61. But in the context of the fasciculus of sections in
which it appears it is clear that it refers to the fact that the registering officer had completed his duty
and had no more to do with the document presented to him, beyond returning the original to the
party entitled to receive the same. In our opinion, these words have nothing to do with the time
from which the transaction covered by the registered document operates or with reference to the
present context, when the sale evidenced by the deed, becomes complete. Specific provision is made
for these in s. 47 of the Registration Act which reads:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79945213/ 7Prem Narain vs Mahabir Jain on 7 May, 2018
"A registered document shall operate from the time from which it would have
commenced to operate if no registration thereof had been required or made, and not
from the time of its registration."
19. The principles underlying ss. 61(2) and 47 are not divergent. It is not as if, that any delay by the
regis- tering officer which might take place owing to the pressure of work in his office or for other
reason, has any effect on the rights of parties, quod their property or the time from when the deed
operates, or as regards the effectiveness of the transaction, or the priority of transactions inter se. It
is not as if, documents executed on different dates, the parties intending them to operate at different
times, have their intentions modified, if not nullified by the action or inaction of the registering
officer, or any delay that might take place in his office. A contention that though the Muslim law of
sale is superseded by the Transfer of Property Act and the Registration Act, but yet the provision
contained in s. 47 of the Registration Act is inapplicable to determine when a sale effected by a
registered instrument should be complete could not be sustained on any principle or logic, or of
course on any rule of interpretation of statutes. In our opinion no distinction is possible to be drawn
between a sale which is effective and one which is complete since they are merely different forms of
expressing the same concept and for the same reason between the time from when a sale becomes
effective and when it should be held to be complete. As under Muslim law the talabs have to be
performed only immediately after the preemptor receives information of the sale, the view we take
of the applicability of s. 47 of the Registration Act, introduces no element of hardship in the exercise
of the option. We are, therefore, clearly of the opinion that the time when the sale becomes complete
so as to entitle the preemptor to perform the talabs should be determined by the application of the
principle of intention laid down in s. 47 of the Registration Act Which is as much a part of the
positive law governing the right of preemption as the provision of s. 54 of the Transfer of Property
Act which, requires a registered instrument to effect a sale which gives rise to a right of preemption.
20. If, therefore, B. 47 of the Registration Act should apply to determine the time from which the
registered document should have effect or, in other words, the time from which the sale should be
held to be complete, the intention of the parties would be the crucial and only test. That has to be
gathered by reference to the document itself read in the light of the surrounding circumstances, with
however a proviso that if the document were clear and its terms explicit, no evidence to contradict
them would be admissible. Paragraph 4 of this document of the sale-deed Ex. 'A' dated January 31,
1946 recites the consideration for the same. This was to consist of Rs. 2,000. Out of this, it states
that the vendors had received Rs. 400 in cash at the time of the execution of the document, and that
Rs. 200 had been left with the purchaser for payment to a previous possessory mortgagee. In regard
to the balance of Rs. 1,400 the recital reads:
"and received the remaining sum of Rs. 1,400 in cash at the time of exchange of
equivalents, (that is) at the time of handing over of the receipt of this deed. In this
manner we have received the entire amount of consideration money for this vended
property from the claimant and brought the same to our possession and use."
The learned Counsel for the respondents has argued that the provision of Section 47 of the
Registration Act is very clear and it clearly provides that a registered document shall operate from
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79945213/ 8Prem Narain vs Mahabir Jain on 7 May, 2018
the time from which it would have commenced to operate if no registration thereof had been
required or made and not from the time of its registration. The registration of a document on
subsequent date will take effect from the time when it was executed and not from the time of its
registration.
He has also relied upon the Judgment of this Court in the case Chaturbhuj Sharma (supra) but on
paragraph nos. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 35 and 36 as follows:-
23. The object of an enactment is often judged from the contents thereof and it is not
necessary that the object of any enactment or a provision thereof is only one and not
more. Where any provision has been worded generally, we would not be justified to
restrict its scope. As Section 47 has been worded generally, its scope can be, as
mentioned above, when it is considered along with Section 48 of the Transfer of
Property Act. But if we have to find out from which date the document shall operate
in so far as the parties to the document are concerned, Section 48 does not come into
operation and a finding shall have to be recorded on consideration of the provisions
of Section 47 alone. In other words, we would not be justified to restrict the scope of
Section 47 of the Registration Act and to hold that its object is only what is detailed in
Section 48 of the Transfer of Property Act. If such was the intention of the
Legislature, Section 47 would not have been incorporated in the Registration Act and
instead a more comprehensive Section 48 would have been incorporated in the
Transfer of Property Act.
24. In this connection it may be observed that the Supreme Court had made the
observations in connection with the right of pre-emption governed by the
Mohammedan Law where such right arose only out of a valid, complete and bona fide
sale. There the Supreme Court was considering the effect of a demand made before
the sale was complete, i.e., after the execution of the sale deed and before the
registration thereof. In substance, the rights claimed by the pre-emptor and the
rights of the transferee were in issue. The Supreme Court were not considering from
which date the rights of a transferee can be enforced irrespective of whether there has
or has not been any other demand or transaction. The above observation made in the
Supreme Court case cannot, therefore, be regarded to be applicable to all the
situations.
25. Section 61(2) of the Registration Act lays down that the registration of a
document shall be deemed to be complete after the endorsements and certificate
referred to and mentioned in Sections 59 and 60 have been copied into the margin of
the Register Book. Under Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act, the transfer by
sale of immovable property of a value of Rs. 100/- and more can be made only by
registered document. On reading Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act along
with Section 61 of the Registration Act, it can be said that the sale is complete after
the compliance of Sections 59, 60 and 61 has been made and not when the document
has been executed or presented for registration. Title to the property may pass when
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79945213/ 9Prem Narain vs Mahabir Jain on 7 May, 2018
the transaction is complete, that is, after the necessary endorsements have been
made in the Register Book. But the transferee can, if permissible under the law,
acquire right in the property from an earlier date. Section 47 of the Registration Act,
in one way, gives a retrospective effect to a document after it has been duly
registered. Like the retrospective enactments, a document having retrospective effect
from the earlier date and not necessarily on the date when the transaction is
complete. When the matter is considered in this light the transaction of sale may not
be complete before registration, but after registration it takes effect from the date of
execution namely, that the purchaser can assert his rights of ownership from the date
of execution even though his title became complete on a later date-When the owner
can assert his rights of ownership from an earlier date, his possession during the
period prior to the registration shall after the registration of the document be as
owner and not as a licensee or an outsider. On a careful consideration of the
provisions of the Registration Act. we are of opinion that a document registered on a
subsequent date operates from the date of its execution even though it can be said
that the title of the transferee is not complete till the registration.
26. Our attention has been drawn to a few decisions of the Supreme Court, the Privy
Council. Allahabad High Court and also the other High Courts and we find that the
consensus of opinion is in favour of the view that we are adopting. In Ram Saran Lall
v. Domini Kuer, AIR 1961 SC 1747 (Supra) the point for consideration was when was
the sale complete and not the date from which it operates. In paragraph 8 it was
observed that;
"We will assume that the learned Attorney General's construction of the instrument
of sale that the property was intended to pass under it on the date of the instrument
is correct Section 47 of the Registration Act does not, however, say when a sale would
be deemed to be complete. It only permits a document when registered, to operate
from a certain date which may be earlier than the date when it was registered. The
obiect of this section is to decide which of two or more registered instruments in
respect of the same property is to have effect. The section applies to a document only
after it has been registered. It has nothing to do with the completion of the
registration and, therefore, nothing to do with the completion of a sale when the
instrument is one of sale. A sale which is admittedly not completed until the
registration of the instrument of sale is completed, cannot be said to have been
completed earlier because by virtue of Section 47 the instrument by which it is
effected, after it has been registered, commences to operate from an earlier date." On
the other hand, the above makes it evident that even though the sale is complete on a
subsequent date it operates by virtue of Section 47 of the Registration Act from the
date of execution. The transferee can thus enforce his rights of ownership from the
date of registration.
The case of K.J. Nathan v. S. V. Maruthi Rao, (AIR 1965 SC 4301 contains a similar
observation, namely, that:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79945213/ 10Prem Narain vs Mahabir Jain on 7 May, 2018
"Though Ex A-19 was registered on June 22, 1948, under Section 47 of the
Registration Act the agreement would take effect from July 5, 1947" (July 5, 1947 is
the date of execution of the document).
27. In Alapati Venkataramiah v. Commr. of Income-Tax, (AIR 1966 SC 115) it was
observed that till a conveyance was executed and registered no title could pass to the
transferee. This is what we have already indicated above. This ease nowhere lays
down that a conveyance when executed and registered shall take effect from the date
of registration and not from the date of execution.
28. T.V. Kalyanasundaram Pillai v. Karuppa Mooppanar, (AIR 1927 PC 42) and
Venkat Subba Srinivas Hegde v. Subba Rama Hegde, (AIR 1928 PC 86) relate to a gift
deed and not a sale deed. However, the principles laid down therein will clearly
establish that the rights and benefits under the document can be exercised from the
date of execution. It was held that once a gift is executed and has been delivered to
the donee, the donor cannot revoke the gift even before its registration on the ground
that the gift is not completed until the deed is register-ed. When the donee can claim
under the document even though not registered, there is no reason why a transferee
cannot assert his rights as owner of the property even though his title is not complete
and would become complete after the registration of the document.
29. In Mohammad Bashir Khan v. Mt. Kulsum Bibi, (AIR 1927 All 545) Preemption
Act of 1922 was held to be inapplicable because the sale deed had been executed
before 17th February. 1923, the date from which the provisions of the Act were
applicable. This view was taken even when the deed of transfer was registered after
that date. In other words, the transfer was deemed to have been made on the date of
execution, and not on the date of registration. In Mahadeo Singh v. Mian Din, (AIR
1938 All 431) it was held that after executing the sale deed it is not open to the
executant to go back on his agreement and revoke it. The observation that the sale
deed is completed when it is executed by the vendor is however, contrary to the
provisions of Section 61 of the Registration Act and the law laid down in Alapati
Venkataramiah v. Commr. of Income-tax. AIR 1966 SC 115 (Supra). The view taken in
Raja Ram v. Girraj Kishore, (AIR 1964 All 369) supports the view that we are taking.
The material observation is:
"unless a sale deed is registered, the mere fact of its execution does not make it
operative, but by reason of Section 47 once registration has been effected the sale
deed becomes operative retrospectively from the date of execution."
30. Hira Lall Burman v. The District Board, Aligarh. (ILR (1966) 2 All 784) is not very helpful as it
proceeds on A different ground, namely, from which date the transferee becomes the owner of the
property. It may, however, be observed that the observations in this case appear to be contrary to
the law laid down in Alapati Venkataramiah v. Commr. of Income-tax, AIR 1966 SC 115 (Supra).

31. Cases of other High Courts in which a document registered subsequently was held to take effect
from the date of execution are: Faiyazuddin Khan v. Mt. Zahur Bibi, (AIR 1938 Pat 134),
Bhagawathula Kameswara Rao v. Doddaku Veera Raghavulu, (AIR 1960 Andh Pra 616), Champat
Rao Mahadeo v. Mahadeo Bajirao Kunbi, (AIR 1937 Nag 143) and Nabadwip Chandra Das v. Loke
Nath Roy. (AIR 1933 Cal 212).
On the application of this principle, sale deed executed before the filing of the suit but registered
thereafter was held not to be affected by the doctrine of lis pendens. See Akki Guru Basappa v.
Valuvathi, (AIR 1925 Mad 710).
32. A contrary view has, however, been expressed in Nabir Ganai v. Mohammad Ismail Ganai, (AIR
1960 J & K 112). Therein it was held that as between parties, registered document takes effect from,
the date of its execution but as between third parties it takes effect from the date of registration. In
case it was desired to lay down an inflexible rule applicable to all cases, we would with respect differ.
The Supreme Court has clearly laid down in Ram Saran Lall v. Mst. Domni Kuer, (AIR 1961 SC 1747)
that the object of Section 47 of the Registration Act is to determine the priority of various
transactions pertaining to the same immovable property, parties to the various instruments shall
not be the same. The transferees would invariably be different persons. Consequently, the
observation that a document takes effect as between third parties from the date of registration is
contrary to the law laid down by the Supreme Court.
33. To avoid the possibility of any misunderstanding it may be mentioned that departure from the
scope of Section 47, Registration Act may be made in exceptional cases involving a question of
limitation but not where the effect of the document and the rights of the transferor and the
transferee have to be determined In such a case Section 47 must be interpreted as it is, that is, no
restrictions not contemplated by the section be imposed.
34. One of the cases in which, in our opinion also, departure can be made from the strict scope of
Section 47 is that of Paritala Narasimham v. Ayinampudi, (AIR 1957 Andh Pra 535). It was held
therein that the transfer cannot be antedated for the purpose of Section 54 of the Insolvency Act.
Also see Venkadari Samappa v. Official Receiver. (AIR 1938 Mad 801).
35. From the above it shall be evident that except for the Jammu and Kashmir High Court, every
High Court, has taken the view that by virtue of Section 47 of the Registration Act, a registered
document takes effect from the date of its execution and this, in our opinion, is the only view that
can be taken of the provisions of Section 47 of the Registration Act.
36. Once the document takes effect from the date of execution, the transferee can assert his rights
under the document from the date of the execution. Once the transferee can assert his rights from
that date, his possession of the property under transfer shall be as owner and in no other capacity.
He has further argued that as per Article 59 of the Limitation Act, there is 3 years period provided
for instituting the suit for cancellation of the sale deed. The aforesaid article provides that the
limitation for filing such a suit shall start from the date of knowledge of the instrument. It has not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79945213/ 12Prem Narain vs Mahabir Jain on 7 May, 2018
been provided that the period of limitation will start running from the date of registration/ date of
enforceability of the document. Therefore, when the plaintiff acquired the knowledge of the
execution of the unregistered document in January, 1975, he ought to have instituted the suit within
3 years. In view of the express provision in the statute in this regard normal rule of construction will
apply and the reliance upon Section 49(c), 60 and 61 of the Registration Act and Section 54 of the
Transfer of Property Act will not help the appellant, in view of Section 47 of the Registration Act.
After hearing the rival contentions and the material placed before this Court, the substantial
questions framed in this appeal is being considered. First of all look at Article -59 of the Limitation
Act, 1963 is necessary, Art. 59. To cancel or set aside an instrument or decree or for the rescission of
a contract.
Three years When the facts entitling the plaintiff to have the instrument or decree cancelled or set
aside or the contract rescinded first become known to him.
The dispute is when the facts entitling the plaintiff to have the instrument cancelled first became
known to him. The dispute is whether the starting point of limitation would be reckoned from the
date of execution of the sale deed (i.e., 25.11.1974 ) or from the date of its registration (i.e.,
21.04.1977). Another important date involved is 29.11.1975, when the plaintiff objected before the
Registrar against the registration of the sale deed dated 25.11.1974. The Counsel for the respondents
has pointed out that the plaintiff, who deposed as P.W.1 in the suit, has admitted the knowledge of
execution of the disputed sale deed 25.11.1974 in January, 1975. Therefore, the above 4 dates are
vital for deciding the fate of this appeal.
While the learned Counsel for the appellant relies on Section 49(c), 60 and 61 of the Registration
Act, 1908, the Counsel for the respondents relies upon Section-47, thereof.
A perusal of Section-49 provides that Registered document shall operate from the time of its
execution and not from the time of registration, if no registration thereof had been required or
made. But if the document is not registered and is compulsorily registerable, it is duly executed, it
has no legal effect and it does not affects the immoveable property comprised in the said document
in view of Section-49 of the Act. It is to be borne in mind that under Section 54 of the Transfer of
Property Act, transfer of tangible immoveable property can only be made by registered instrument.
Without registration, there is no transfer of ownership of the property. Therefore, it is clear that the
act of registration is not a mere instance of collecting revenue by the State as Registration Fee and
providing authenticity to the document. It is by act of registration, that the title of the property
passes to the transferor from the date of execution of the deed of transfer.
Now the question arises as to what would be the interpretation of the phrase employed in Article-59
of the Limitation Act, "When the facts entitling the plaintiff who have the instrument or decree
cancelled or set aside or the contract rescinded first became known to him."
"Facts entitling the plaintiff" speak about the point when entitlement of the plaintiff
first became effective for instituting the suit. In the present case, the plaintiff's own
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79945213/ 13Prem Narain vs Mahabir Jain on 7 May, 2018
admission is that he came to know about the fact of execution of unregistered sale
deed in January, 1975. Thereafter, he filed objection before the Registrar on
29.11.1975 against the registration of the deed and the deed which was executed on
25.11.1974 got registered on 21.04.1977. As per Section- 49(c) of the Registration Act
read with Section-54 of the Transfer of Property Act, the suit could not have been
instituted by the plaintiff without producing in evidence the registered sale deed.
Further without registration the sale deed did not evidenced any transfer of title by
virtue of the unregistered sale deed dated 25.11.1974. The suit filed for cancellation of
unregistered document, whereby no title passed to the defendants, as per Section -54
of the Transfer of Property Act would not have been maintainable. Therefore for the
purpose of instituting the suit and for reckoning the starting point of limitation for
challenging the sale deed would be, as per Article 59 of the Limitation Act, the
knowledge of the fact of registration of the document which created entitlement of
the plaintiff to institute the suit. Prior to registration of document, the plaintiff was
legally disentitled to challenge the sale deed before the competent Civil Court, being
unregistered document not receivable in evidence as per Section 49(c) of the
Registration Act, 1908.
There is no quarrel with the proposition that the effect of the document relates back
to the date of execution once it is registered and therefore the reliance of the Counsel
for the respondent on the ratio laid down in the case of Chaturbhuj Sharma (supra) is
well founded. However, the facts of the case were different, there was no dispute
regarding the starting point of limitation for instituting the suit as per Article-59 of
the Limitation Act, 1963. The reliance of the Counsel for the appellant on the
Judgment of the Apex Court in paragraph no.8 of Ram Saran Lall & others (supra),
and paragraph 33 of Chaturbhuj Sharma (supra) is well founded. Section 47 of the
Registration Act does not states when a sale would be deemed to be complete for the
purposes of Limitation for instituting suit. It only permits a document when
registered, to operate from a certain date which may be earlier then the date when it
was registered. The object of the Section is to decide which of two or more registered
instruments in respect of the same property is to have effect. The Section applies to a
document only after it has been registered. It has nothing to do with the completion
of registration and therefore nothing to do with completion of a sale, when the
instrument is a sale deed. A sale is not completed until the registration of the
instrument of sale is completed (as per Section 60 and 61 of the Registration Act),
therefore it can not be said that the sale has been completed earlier because by virtue
of Section 47 of the Registration Act, the instrument commences to operate from an
earlier date.
It is clear that the entitlement of the plaintiff to institute the suit arose only when he
got the knowledge of the registration of the sale deed dated 25.11.1974 on 21.04.1977.
Therefore, the suit of the plaintiff instituted on 22.09.1978 can not be said to be
barred by time. It has been instituted within period of 3 years of the execution of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79945213/ 14Prem Narain vs Mahabir Jain on 7 May, 2018
registered sale deed dated 21.04.1977 as per Article 59 of the Limitation Act, 1963.
Hence the substantial question of law is answered in favour of the plaintiff holding
that the starting point of limitation for instituting the suit for cancellation of transfer
deed would commenced from the date of knowledge of the registration of the
document and not from the date of execution of the same.
Consequently, the Judgment and Decree dated 26.10.1989 passed by the lower
appellate court and the Judgment and Decree dated 16.05.1986 passed by the trial
court are hereby set aside. The suit of the plaintiff is decreed.
The Second Appeal is allowed with costs throughout.
