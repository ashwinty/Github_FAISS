PER: ANIL SRIVASTAVA, MEMBER JUDGEMENT/ORDER
1. An application has been filed by the complainant praying for correction in the orders passed by
this Commission on 15.01.2021 in CC-605/2013 in the matter of Ashok Kumar Varma versus Bharat
Group of Hotels, directing in para 7 of the judgement as under:-
Keeping in view the facts of the case and overall position, we are of the considered
view that ends of justice would be met if direction is issued to the OPs to rectify and
to remove the defective works done in the construction of the building and to hand
over the completion certificate if not already done. Secondly the OPs are also directed
to pay Rs. 20 Lakhs to the complainant as compensation for the mental agony caused
and litigation cost. This be done within a period of two months from the date of
receipt of the copy of the order. Ordered according, leaving the parties to bear the
cost.
2. Prayer has been made for correction which otherwise means prayer for review of the order.

3. The complaint in question was filed in the year 2013 under the provisions of Section 15 of the
Consumer Protection Act 1986. Under the 1986 Act power to review was not available to the State
Commission.
4. The bare perusal of the application reflects that it has been preferred under section 50 of the new
Act i.e. the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. However, the entire proceedings of the present case took
place according to the old Act. Hence, before delving into the merits of the present application, it is
imperative to ascertain whether the present application for review of the order is maintainable
under the new Act or not?
5. The repeal of a law shall not affect the previous operation of any enactment i.e. the proceedings
under Consumer Protection Act, 1986 shall continue for cases which had been filed prior to the
implementation of Consumer Protection Act, 2019 on 20.07.2020. The same can be gauged through
the repeal and saving section (Section 107) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 which has been
reproduced below:
"107. (1) The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is hereby repealed.
(2) Notwithstanding such repeal, anything done or any action taken or purported to
have been done or taken under the Act hereby repealed shall, in so far as it is not
inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, be deemed to have been done or taken
under the corresponding provisions of this Act.
(3) The mention of particular matters in sub-section (2) shall not be held to prejudice
or affect the general application of section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 with
regard to the effect of repeal."
6. We may also take the assistance of Section 6 (b) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 to further this
view. Section 6 (b) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 has been reproduced below:-
"6 Effect of repeal. : Where this Act, or any 1 [Central Act] or Regulation made after
the commencement of this Act, repeals any enactment hitherto made or hereafter to
be made, then, unless a different intention appears, the repeal shall not
(a) revive anything not in force or existing at the time at which the repeal takes effect;
or
(b) affect the previous operation of any enactment so repealed or anything duly done
or suffered thereunder"
7. Moreover, unless the legislature explicitly provides that the amendment is retrospective in nature,
it will be considered prospective. The aforesaid view has been taken by the Apex Court in the case of
CIT v. Vatika Township (P) Ltd. reported in (2015) 1 SCC 1 wherein the Court discussed the proviso
to Section 113 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and held that it was prospective and not retrospective.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/162253525/ 2Ashok Kumar Verma vs Bharat Group Of Hotels on 28 September, 2021
While deciding the case, the Constitution Bench laid down certain general principles which have
been reproduced as under:-
"28. Of the various rules guiding how a legislation has to be interpreted, one
established rule is that unless a contrary intention appears, a legislation is presumed
not to be intended to have a retrospective operation. The idea behind the rule is that a
current law should govern current activities. Law passed today cannot apply to the
events of the past. If we do something today, we do it keeping in view the law of today
and in force and not tomorrow's backward adjustment of it. Our belief in the nature
of the law is founded on the bedrock that every human being is entitled to arrange his
affairs by relying on the existing law and should not find that his plans have been
retrospectively upset. This principle of law is known as lex prospicit non respicit: law
looks forward not backward. As was observed in Phillips v. Eyre [Phillips v. Eyre,
(1870) LR 6 QB 1] , a retrospective legislation is contrary to the general principle that
legislation by which the conduct of mankind is to be regulated when introduced for
the first time to deal with future acts ought not to change the character of past
transactions carried on upon the faith of the then existing law.
29. The obvious basis of the principle against retrospectively is the principle of
"fairness", which must be the basis of every legal rule as was observed in L'Office
Cherifien des Phosphates v. Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co. Ltd. [L'Office
Cherifien des Phosphates v. Yamashita-Shinnihon Steamship Co. Ltd., (1994) 1 AC
486 : (1994) 2 WLR 39 : (1994) 1 All ER 20 (HL)] Thus, legislations which modified
accrued rights or which impose obligations or impose new duties or attach a new
disability have to be treated as prospective unless the legislative intent is clearly to
give the enactment a retrospective effect; unless the legislation is for purpose of
supplying an obvious omission in a former legislation or to explain a former
legislation. We need not note the cornucopia of case law available on the subject
because aforesaid legal position clearly emerges from the various decisions and this
legal position was conceded by the counsel for the parties. In any case, we shall refer
to few judgments containing this dicta, a little later."
(emphasis in original)
8. Similarly, the Apex Court in Hitendra Vishnu Thakur vs State of Maharashtra
reported in 1994 (4) SCC602,the court has culled out the ambit and scope of an
amending Act and its retrospective operation and has held the following:-
"26. The Designated Court has held that the amendment would operate
retrospectively and would apply to the pending cases in which investigation was not
complete on the date on which the Amendment Act came into force and the challan
had not till then been filed in the court. From the law settled by this Court in various
cases the illustrative though not exhaustive principles which emerge with regard to
the ambit and scope of an Amending Act and its retrospective operation may be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/162253525/ 3Ashok Kumar Verma vs Bharat Group Of Hotels on 28 September, 2021
culled out as follows:
(i) A statute which affects substantive rights is presumed to be prospective in
operation unless made retrospective, either expressly or by necessary intendment,
whereas a statute which merely affects procedure, unless such a construction is
textually impossible, is presumed to be retrospective in its application, should not be
given an extended meaning and should be strictly confined to its clearly defined
limits.
(ii) Law relating to forum and limitation is procedural in nature, whereas law relating
to right of action and right of appeal even though remedial is substantive in nature.
(iii) Every litigant has a vested right in substantive law but no such right exists in
procedural law.
(iv) A procedural statute should not generally speaking be applied retrospectively
where the result would be to create new disabilities or obligations or to impose new
duties in respect of transactions already accomplished.
(v) A statute which not only changes the procedure but also creates new rights and
liabilities shall be construed to be prospective in operation, unless otherwise
provided, either expressly or by necessary implication."
9. Taking into account the aforesaid discussion, we conclude that the Consumer
Protection Act, 2019 is prospective in nature. Thus, the cases pending or adjudicated
and rights/obligations created before the coming into effect of the Consumer
Protection Act, 2019 will continue to be adjudicated under the old Act i.e. Consumer
Protection Act, 1986. Hence, the applicant cannot resort to the provisions as
inculcated in the new act so far as the present case is concerned as their case will be
governed by the provisions of the old act.
10. So far as the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is concerned, it does not provides
the power of review to the State Commissions. This position of law was settled in the case of Rajeev
Hitendra Pathak and Ors. v. Achyut Kashinath Karekar and Anr. reported in (2011) 9 SCC 541
wherein the Apex Court held:-
"36. On careful analysis of the provisions of the Act, it is abundantly clear that the
Tribunals are creatures of the Statute and derive their power from the express
provisions of the Statute. The District Forums and the State Commissions have not
been given any power to set aside ex parte orders and power of review and the powers
which have not been expressly given by the Statute cannot be exercised.
37. The legislature chose to give the National Commission power to review its ex
parte orders. Before amendment, against dismissal of any case by the Commission,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/162253525/ 4Ashok Kumar Verma vs Bharat Group Of Hotels on 28 September, 2021
the consumer had to rush to this Court. The amendment in Section 22 and
introduction of Section 22-A were done for the convenience of the consumers. We
have carefully ascertained the legislative intention and interpreted the law
accordingly.
38. In our considered opinion, the decision in Jyotsana's case laid down the correct
law and the view taken in the later decision of this Court in New India Assurance Co.
Ltd. is untenable and cannot be sustained.
39. In view of the legal position, in Civil Appeal No.4307 of 2007, the findings of the
National Commission are set aside as far as it has held that the State Commission can
review its own orders. After the amendment in Section 22 and introduction of Section
22A in the Act in the year 2002 by which the power of review or recall has vested with
the National Commission only. However, we agree with the findings of the National
Commission holding that the Complaint No.473 of 1999 be restored to its original
number for hearing in accordance with law."
11. Having regard to the legal position explained I am of the considered view that CC-605/2013
would be governed by the Consumer Protection Act 1986, the complaint having been filed prior to
the amendment in the Act and thus the order dated 15.01.2021 cannot be reviewed, relying on the
provisions of Section 50 of the Act of 2019. Consequently the application is rejected since not
maintainable.
12. Ordered accordingly leaving the parties to bear the cost.
13. A copy of this order be forwarded to the parties to the case free of cost as is statutorily required.
File be consigned to records.
