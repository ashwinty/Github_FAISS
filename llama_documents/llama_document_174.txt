JUDGMENT
Brijesh Kumar, J.
1. In this bunch of writ petitions, the petitioner, namely, the Food Corporation of India, who claims
to perform governmental function for the purposes of constituting national pool of foodgrains,
objects to the levy of purchase tax by the State of U.P. under the U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948. The
different writ petitions relate to different assessment years. However, since according to learned
counsel for the petitioner, points raised and argued are common, covering all the petitions, we
propose to dispose of all the petitions by this judgment.
2. The Food Corporation of India is a "dealer" as defined under Section 2(c) of the U.P. Sales Tax
Act, 1948, which reads as follows :
(c) 'dealer' means any person who carries on in Uttar Pradesh (whether regularly or
otherwise) the business of buying, selling, supplying or distributing goods directly or
indirectly, for cash or deferred payment or for commission, remuneration or other
valuable consideration and includes-
(i) a local authority, body corporate, company, any co-operative society or other
society, club, firm, Hindu undivided family or other association of persons which
carries on such business;
(iii) ...
(iv) a Government which, whether in the course of business or otherwise buys, sells,
supplies or distributes goods, directly or otherwise for cash or for deferred payment
or for commission, remuneration or other valuable consideration;
(v) ...
(vi) ...

3. The word "business" has been defined in Clause (aa) of Section 2 as follows:
2. (aa) 'business', in relation to business of buying or selling goods, includes :-
(i) any trade, commerce or manufacture, or any adventure or concern in the nature of
trade, commerce or manufacture, whether or not such trade, commerce,
manufacture, adventure or concern is carried on with a motive to make profit and
whether or not any profit accrues from such trade, commerce, manufacture,
adventure or concern; and
(ii) ...
but does not include any activity in the nature of mere service or profession which does not involve
the purchase or sale of goods.
4. The charging provision is Section 3 of the U. P. Sales Tax Act, 1948 which provides as follows :
3. (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, every dealer shall, for each assessment
year, pay a tax at the rates provided by or under Section 3-A, or Section 3-D on his
turnover of sales or purchases or both, as the case may be, which shall be determined
in such manner as may be prescribed.

5. The Food Corporation of India is a "corporation" incorporated under the Food Corporations Act,
1964 (Central Act No. 37 of 1964). As one of its functions it maintains a national pool of foodgrains.
The different States have to make their contributions to this pool. The States issued different orders
under the Essential Commodities Act, known by different names as Levy Orders, Procurement
Orders or Requisition Orders, for purchasing part of the produce or stocks of the foodgrains in
question from farmers or millers. The procurement is made through different agencies. On
obtaining the required quantity of the foodgrains, it is purchased by the Food Corporation of India
from the State Governments for the purposes of maintaining the national pool of foodgrains. The
Sales Tax Department of U. P. seeks to levy purchase tax upon the Food Corporation of India on the
point it makes purchases from the State of U. P. The Food Corporation of India denies its liability to
pay the said tax.
6. Although the purchase made by the Food Corporation of India from the State is a second sale or
purchase but under explanation II to Section 3-D(1) of the U. P. Sales Tax Act, it is deemed to be the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 2Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
first purchase. The explanation II was added with retrospective effect by U. P. Act No. 23 of 1976. It
is specifically in respect of purchase of foodgrains in pursuance of orders made under Section 3 of
the Essential Commodities Act. The explanation II reads as follows :
Explanation II.-For the purposes of this sub-section, in relation to purchases of
foodgrains in pursuance of an}^ order made under Section 3 of the Essential
Commodities Act, 1955, including any purchase in excess of the levy share, the
purchase first made by a dealer from the State Government or its purchasing agent
shall be the first purchase of such foodgrains and the tax shall accordingly be levied
at that point on such dealer.
7. An additional tax was also payable at the rate of five per cent over the turnover by the dealer
whose yearly turnover exceeded rupees ten crores as provided under Section 3-F of the U. P. Sales
Tax Act, which now stands omitted by U. P. Act No. 4 of 1982 with effect from 7th September, 1981.
Section 3-F as it existed is as follows :
3-F. Every dealer liable to pay tax under this Act, the aggregate of whose total
turnover of purchases of goods notified under Sub-section (1) of Section 3-D, the
turnover of sales liable to tax under Sub-section (2) of Section 3-D and of the total
turnover of sales of all other goods, in any assessment year exceeds rupees two lakhs
shall, in addition to the said tax, pay for that assessment year an additional tax at the
rate of one per cent, of his turnover liable to tax :
Provided that in the case of foodgrains, the rate of additional tax payable by any
dealer, the aggregate of whose turnover or turnover of purchases or both, as the case
may be, liable to tax, exceeds rupees ten crores in an assessment year shall be five per
cent.
...
8. Since the turnover of the petitioner had been more than ten crores, it was also required to pay
additional tax for the period Section 3-F remained in operation.
9. The petitioner has challenged the validity of explanation II to Section 3-D(1) of the U.P. Sales Tax
Act as well as that of Section 3-F of the Act on the ground that the said provisions are
discriminatory, arbitrary and unreasonable.
10. Shri V.K.S. Chaudhari, learned counsel for the petitioner, has submitted that the tax under the
U. P. Sales Tax Act is not liable to be levied upon the petitioner as the Food Corporation of India, for
the purposes of maintaining the national pool of foodgrains, discharges the governmental function.
It has also been contended that the transactions as involved, do not amount to sale. Rather,
transactions are in the nature of compulsory acquisition of property, hence not liable to be taxed
under the U. P. Sales Tax Act. Another limb of the first contention is that the Food Corporation of
India is only a service corporation. As such there cannot be any liability for payment of purchase tax
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 3Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
for the services rendered by the Food Corporation of India.
11. In support of the first part of his argument that the Food Corporation of India discharges
governmental function, the learned counsel for the petitioner has taken us through the different
provisions of the Food Corporations Act, 1964. Section 5 provides that the original capital of
corporation shall be such sum not exceeding one hundred crores of rupees as the Central
Government may fix. Sub-section (3) of Section 5 provides that such capital may be provided by the
Central Government from time to time after due appropriation made by Parliament by law for the
purpose and subject to such terms and conditions as may be determined by that Government.
Section 6 of the Food Corporations Act provides for management of the corporation by the board of
directors. Constitution of the board of directors is provided under Section 7 which provides for
representatives of different Ministries of the Central Government dealing with food, finance and
co-operation. Sub-section (3) of Section 9 has also been placed before us to show that a director of
the corporation can submit his resignation from the office of director by giving notice in writing to
the Central Government. Section 12A provides that where the Central Government has ceased to
perform any functions which under Section 13 are functions of the corporation, the Central
Government may transfer to the corporation any of the officers or employees serving in the office of
the Central Government dealing with food or engaged in the performance of those functions. The
primary duty of the corporation as provided under Sub-section (1) of Section 13 is to undertake the
purchase, storage, movement, transport, distribution and sale of foodgrains and other food-stuffs. It
can also undertake activities for promoting production of foodgrains and setting up of rice mills,
etc., with the previous approval of the Central Government. Under Section 26 of the Food
Corporations Act, the Food Corporation of India is required to submit programme of its activities
each year and the financial estimates to the Central Government for approval. Our attention has also
been drawn to Section 33 which provides that net annual profits earned by the Food Corporation of
India shall be paid to the Central Government. Under Section 34, the Food Corporation of India is
required to maintain its annual statement of accounts including the profit and loss account and the
balance-sheet in the prescribed form and the accounts are to be audited by auditors appointed from
the list of auditors approved by the Central Government on the advice of the Comptroller and
Auditor-General of India. Under Section 35, an annual report is required to be submitted by the
corporation to the Central Government about the working and its affairs, which is to be laid before
both Houses of Parliament for necessary comments on the report. Section 40 protects the
corporation and members of its board of directors and other officers from any legal proceedings for
any act done in good faith in pursuance of the provisions of the Act. Our attention has also been
drawn to Section 42 of the Act which specifically provides for payment of income-tax by the
corporation as a company.
12. On the basis of the provisions indicated above, it has been submitted that the functions, which
are now being carried on by the Food Corporation of India are such which had been carried on by
the Central Government. It has been submitted that it is a primary duty of the State to provide food
to the needy citizens of the country and to have proper distribution of the foodgrains for
consumption of the citizens at a price which is within the reach of a common man. With a view to
achieve this end, the Food Corporation of India maintains a national pool of foodgrains. The method
to raise the national pool is that after a decision is taken in the meeting, in which the officers of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 4Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
Food Corporation of India and different Ministries of the Government of India and others
participate, the States are required to contribute to the national pool. The States in their turn issue
Levy or Procurement Orders under the Essential Commodities Act for procurement of specified
foodgrains which is made over by the States to the Food Corporation of India to raise and maintain
the national pool. The Food Corporotion of India, on the directions issued by the Government of
India from time to time, sends the required quantity of foodgrains to the deficit States or at times to
other countries, if so directed. It has further been submitted that the Food Corporation of India acts
as a custodian of the national pool on behalf of the Government of India. The corporation in all
details is controlled by the Central Government, may be in the matter of its management or
otherwise. The profits earned by the corporation are to be credited to the Central Government. The
activities of the corporation described above were being carried on by the Central Government prior
to coming into existence of corporation and the staff of the Central Government connected with such
activities was also transferred to the Food Corporation of India under the provisions of Section 12(3)
of the Food Corporations Act.
13. In support of the fact that the procurement was being made for the national pool, reliance was
placed on annexures 3 and 5 to the writ petition (No. 2077 of 1986). In annexure 3 which is a letter
written by the Secretary to the State Government, Department of Institutional Finance to the
Additional Secretary of the Government of India, Department of Food, it has been mentioned that
the purchase of foodgrains by the Food Corporation of India was on behalf of the Central
Government. Annexure 5 is again a letter by the Joint Secretary to the State Government
mentioning therein that the State Government' and its agencies had been purchasing the foodgrains
for the national pool. These documents have been referred to establish the fact that the foodgrains
purchased by the Food Corporation of India from the State Governments are only contributions of
the State Government towards the national pool. Para 5 of the counter-affidavit has also been
referred to, where it has been stated by the opposite parties that it is admitted that the Food
Corporation of India purchases foodgrains for the national pool. Since, earlier such activity of
procurement of foodgrains had been carried on by the Food Department of the Government of
India, it is a governmental activity now carried on by the petitioner, thus it was not liable to tax. It
has, however, been submitted that in respect of transactions other than those related to levy
foodgrains, it pays sales tax as those transactions do not take place in pursuance of any
governmental function.
14. The learned counsel for the petitioner has referred to Article 285 of the Constitution which
provides for exemption of property of the Union from State taxation. A reference to Article 286 of
the Constitution has also been made. The learned counsel for the petitioner has then referred to
Article 289 of the Constitution which reads as follows :
289. Exemption of property and income of a State from Union taxation.- (1) The
property and income of a State shall be exempt from Union taxation.
(2) Nothing in Clause (1) shall prevent the Union from imposing, or authorising the imposition of,
any tax to such extent, if any, as Parliament may by law provide in respect of a trade or business of
any kind carried on by, or on behalf of, the Government of a State, or any operations connected
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 5Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
therewith, or any property used or occupied for the purposes of such trade or business, or any
income accruing or arising in connection therewith.
(3) Nothing in Clause (2) shall apply to any trade or business, or to any class of trade or business,
which Parliament may by law declare to be incidental to the ordinary functions of Government.
15. Stress has been placed upon Clause (3) on the basis of which it has been submitted that it is clear
that there is distinction between the functions of the Government and its activities of trade or
business. If the trade or business is declared by the Parliament to be incidental to the ordinary
functions of the State Government, that would exempt the property and income of the State from
Union taxation. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, the distinction between the
trade or commercial activities of the State and the activities of trade and commerce incidental in
discharge of the governmental function is quite clear from the provision quoted above. Therefore, if
some transactions take place in discharge of governmental functions, that cannot be called trade or
business activity of the State liable to be taxed.
16. Shri V. Upadhyay, learned counsel for the opposite parties, has submitted that the Food
Corporation of India is neither a department of the Government nor does it perform any
governmental function. Its activities are purely business and commercial activities. The question of
earning profits is wholly immaterial. It has been submitted that the Food Corporation of India is
only a company and it has to be so assessed under the Income-tax Act as provided under Section 42
of the Act.
17. The learned counsel for the opposite parties has taken us through the Statement of Objects and
Reasons for enacting the Food Corporations Act, 1964. The Statement of Objects and Reasons reads
as follows :
Statement of Objects and Reasons (1) It is considered desirable, in the interests of
increased agricultural production as well as in the interests of the common consumer,
to set up a State agency for the purpose of undertaking trading in food-grains in a
commercial manner but within the framework of an overall Government policy. Only
by such a measure it will be possible to effectively implement any policy of ensuring
that the primary producer obtains the minimum price that may be announced from
time to time and to protect the consumer from the vagaries of speculative trade.
(2) The setting up of the Food Corporation of India, as provided for in this Bill, will,
therefore, be one of the essential and important steps in the implementation of
Government's food policy. The corporation will be the first organised attempt to take
up State trading in food-stuffs on an appreciable scale. The agency will also be used
to build up gradually buffer stocks.
(3) The corporation will engage itself primarily in the purchase, storage, movement,
distribution and sale of foodgrains. Provision has also been made in the Bill enabling
the corporation to deal in other food-stuffs if considered necessary by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 6Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
Government. The corporation may also discharge certain incidental functions as
provided for in the Bill in consultation with the Central Government.
(4) The corporation will be encouraged to function generally as an autonomous
organisation working on commercial lines. It is expected to secure for itself a
strategic and commanding position in the foodgrains trade of the country. Bearing in
mind the several large spheres in which the corporation will ultimately have to
operate, this Bill is being introduced to enable it to function as a statutory
corporation wholly owned by the Government.
(5) It is necessary that the corporation should work with the active and continued
co-operation of State Governments and their machinery. The Bill, therefore, provides
for the setting up of Boards of Management or State Food Corporations, as the case
may be, to secure such co-operation and participation in a practical and effective way.
18. From the above, it has been submitted that the corporation is an autonomous body and has to
undertake trading in foodgrains in commercial manner in the interest of producer as well as
consumer. Then a reference has been made to Section 6 of the Food Corporations Act, 1964, which
provides that the board of directors, in discharging its functions, shall act on business principles
having regard to the interests of the producer and consumer. A reference has also been made to
Section 13 which relates to the functions of the corporation. In view of the above, it has been
submitted that it is incorrect to say that the corporation is a service corporation. It has also been
submitted that according to Section 33 of the Act, the net profits earned by the corporation are to be
credited to the Central Government. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that the activities are run on no
profit no loss basis. In any case, it has been submitted that the profit making is not necessary for
carrying on any trade or business so as to be liable to tax under the provisions of the U. P. Sales Tax
Act, In this connection, a reference has also been made to Clause (aa) of Section 2 of the U. P. Sales
Tax Act which defines "business" as any trade, commerce or manufacture, whether or not with a
motive to make profit and whether or not any profit accrues oh such trade, commerce or adventure.
To repel the argument advanced on behalf of the petitioner that the Food Corporation of India is a
department of the Government of India, the learned counsel for the opposite parties has placed
reliance upon a case reported in AIR 1981 SC 1694 {State of Punjab v. Raja Ram), considering
various provisions of the Food Corporations Act, the Honourable Supreme Court came to the
conclusion that the Food Corporation is not a Government department. It has been held to have a
status of a company and an autonomous body. However, looking to the fact that the original share of
capital was provided by the Central Government and the control which is exercised by the Central
Government, it could be said to be an agency or instrumentality of the Central Government.
19. Next case relied upon by the opposite parties is [1976] 38 STC 329 (SC) (Joint Director of Food,
Visakhapatnam v. State of Andhra Pradesh). In this case, the Central Government in discharge of its
high governmental functions, namely, distribution of foodgrains and fertilisers and commodities
essential to the life of community at large, had been procuring such items and had been selling the
same to the States or their nominees so as to ensure equitable supplies at fair price. For this
purpose, the Central Government appointed a Joint Director of Food through whom foodgrains and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 7Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
fertilisers were sold to Andhra Pradesh State and to other States. According to the Sales Tax
Department, the transactions were liable to sales tax under the State Act as well as under the Central
Sales Tax Act. A similar argument was raised on behalf of the Central Government that it was only
implementing its governmental obligations for distribution of essential commodities which cannot
be said to be a trading activity or carrying on business. This argument was not accepted by the
Honourable Supreme Court. The following passage from the judgment may be reproduced which
meets the argument raised in this case :
A subsidiary contention calculated to insulate the Central Government from liability
was set up by the learned Additional Solicitor-General to the effect that an
undertaking to distribute essential commodities by the State in implementation of its
governmental obligations cannot be described as 'trading' activity or carrying on of
'business' without doing violence to the concepts of governmental functions and
business operations. Indubitably the State has the power to carry on trade or
business as is manifest from Article 19(6)(ii) and other provisions. Indubitably, the
State distributes essential commodities in a fair and equitable way for the survival of
the community under its protection. It does not follow that we cannot harmonise the
two functions. It is well on the agenda of State activity that it carries on trade or
business in essential commodities because it has the power to do so and because it is
obligated to ensure even distribution of vital goods for the needy sections of the
people. We see no difficulty in inferring that the systematic activity of buying
foodgrains and fertilisers and selling them by the State, although in fulfilment of a
beneficent national policy is nevertheless trade or business. Necessarily, Government
becomes a 'dealer' by definition and carries on 'business' within the meaning of the
Central Act and the State Act (omitting for a moment the distinction in the two
definitions based upon the motive to make gain or profit). The conclusion, therefore,
is inevitable that the appellant, representing the Central Government, is rightly held
to be the assessee.
20. It may be mentioned here that under the U. P. Sales Tax Act also, the "dealer" includes a
Government as well which in the course of business or otherwise, buys, sells or distributes goods
directly or otherwise for cash or for deferred payment or for commission, remuneration or for other
valuable considerations. We, therefore, find that the case in hand is in no manner different from one
considered in the case of Joint Director of Food [1976] 38 STC 329 (SC).
21. Another case relied upon on behalf of the opposite parties is [1976] 37 STC 423 (SC) (District
Controller of Stores, Northern Railway, Jodhpur v. Assistant Commercial Taxation Officer). In this
case, sales tax was sought to be imposed upon the Northern Railway on the sale of material and
scraps. It was held that such transactions were exigible to tax. This case has been referred to show
that even the railway which is a department of the Government, and which cannot be said to be not
carrying on governmental function was found exigible to sales tax.
22. In respect of the case cited on behalf of the petitioner, namely, 1981 Supreme Court, page 670
wherein it has been held that the Food Corporation of India is an instrumentality of the State,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 8Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
learned counsel for the opposite parties has submitted that it will make no difference so far levy of
tax is concerned. Firstly, it has been submitted that the Food Corporation of India may be
considered as an authority under Article 12 of the Constitution of India for the purpose of Part III
and, secondly, it has been submitted that when an activity carried on by the Government is liable to
be taxed and the Government can be a dealer as denned under the Sales Tax Act, it would not be
gainsaying that an instrumentality of the State cannot be taxed.
23. In view of the facts and cases mentioned above, we are of the view that there is no substance in
the submission made on behalf of the petitioner. Since the petitioner entered into the transactions of
sale and purchase, may be in pursuance of raising the national pool which is meant for equitable
distribution of essential commodities to the needy section of the society and to meet the
requirements of needy people of this country, as were the facts in the case of Joint Director of Food
v. State of Andhra Pradesh [1976] 38 STC 329 (SC), it cannot be said that the transactions entered
into by the petitioner are not liable to sales tax. The activities so carried on by the Food Corporation
of India are clearly covered under the term "business" as defined under the U. P. Sales Tax Act and
the petitioner would clearly be covered under the term "dealer" as denned under the Sales Tax Act.
It is wholly immaterial whether the ,activity is being carried on with a profit making motive or as to
whether actually any profit do accrue or not. It cannot be said that the petitioner discharges
governmental function.
24. We may now consider the' other limb of the argument that, in any case, the Food Corporation of
India, in respect of national pool, can only be said to be a service corporation, which renders service
to the people of the country on "no profit no loss" basis. The loss suffered by the Food Corporation
of India is subsidised by the Central Government. The capital is also provided by the Central
Government.
25. The learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance upon a case reported in [1982] 51 STC
289 (Guj) (Mehsana District Shanker-4 Seeds Produce and Sale Co-operative Society Ltd. v. State of
Gujarat). This is a Division Bench decision rendered by the Gujarat High Court. The Planning
Commission of the Government of India recommended for forming agricultural co-operative
societies of cotton growers for betterment of quality of cotton by distribution and multiplication of
cotton seeds. In pursuance of the above scheme and object, the petitioner-society was registered.
The society supplied seeds to its members and collected some charges in the nature of transport and
other miscellaneous charges. The society also carried on other activities for the betterment of quality
of cotton. The society was sought to be taxed under the Sales Tax Act but it was held that the object
of the society was to give its extensive service to the members and it was merely rendering service by
implementing the Government scheme. It was further observed that the essential purpose of the
activity of such society was not commercial in nature but was to render exclusive service to its
members. An activity in order to be a business must be a commercial activity of buying and selling
with or without motive of profit. It has further been observed that if commercial element is lacking,
it would be beyond the sweep of the term "business" and will not be liable to sales tax.
26. The facts of the case reported in [1982] 51 STC 289 (Guj) (Mehsana District Shanker-4 Seeds
Produce and Sale Co-operative Society Ltd. v. State of Gujarat) are different. The co-operative
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 9Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
society supplied seed, etc., to its own members; so it could be said that the society was rendering
service to its members. But in the case in hand, the position is different. Such activity carried on by
the Central Government was held to be "trade" or "business" activity in the case of Joint Director of
Food, Visakhapatnam [1976] 38 STC 329 (SC). Earning of profit or no profit is held to be
immaterial. Under Section 2(aa)(ii) of the U. P. Sales Tax Act only such a service activity does not
amount to business which does not involve purchase or sale of goods. Petitioner does enter into sale
and purchase of foodgrains. It cannot claim to be an organisation rendering mere service.
27. We may now come to the next point urged on behalf of the petitioner that procurement of
foodgrains under the Levy Orders amounts to compulsory acquisition of property. Therefore, it is
not exigible to tax, not being a transaction of sale or purchase of goods. It has been submitted that
the whole transaction beginning from the decision making to procurement of foodgrains as a
contribution from different States in definite quantities till the supply of such foodgrains to the
deficit States or to other countries, as the case may be, by the Food Corporation of India, is one
transaction which passes through different stages. The foodgrain is acquired from the millers or the
farmers as the case may be for the purposes of national pool with the object of feeding the millions.
It is for that purpose that the State Governments issue Procurement, Levy or Requisition Orders
under the provisions of the Essential Commodities Act. The State Government acquires the
foodgrains through different agencies, e.g., the U. P. Co-operative Federation, Essential
Commodities Corporation, U. P. State Agro Corporation as well as through the Food Corporation of
India in certain areas. After so acquiring the foodgrains it is made over to the petitioner by the State
Government 'for the purposes of national pool. The contention is that such a transaction made in
respect of foodgrains acquired under the Levy or Procurement Orders with one specific purpose as
mentioned above does not amount to sale or purchase.
28. In support of his contention that the transactions in question are in the nature of compulsory
acquisition of property, the learned counsel for the petitioner has made a reference to entry 54 of
List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution which provides for taxes on the sale or purchase
of goods other than newspapers subject to the provisions of entry 92A of List I. He has also referred
to entry 42 of List III of the Seventh Schedule which provides for acquisition and requisition of
property. It has thus been submitted that the sale and purchase of goods and acquisition of property
denote two different concepts and acquisition of property cannot be taxed as tax on sale or purchase
of property. It has been submitted that the main ingredients of acquisition of property are that
acquisition is done by the State for a public purpose for some compensation, consequence of which
is that the rights and title in the property vest in the State irrespective of the fact whether the holder
of the property from whom it is acquired himself had that right or title or not. The act of acquisition
extinguishes the right and title of third person as well who may not directly be involved in the
transaction. In this connection, the learned counsel has referred to Section 6 of the U. P. Zamindari
Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950 and similar provision under the U. P. Urban Area Zamindari
Abolition Act, Section 16 of the Land Acquisition Act and Section 14 of the U.P. Imposition of Ceiling
on Land Holdings Act to show that the property vests in the State free from all encumbrances;
meaning thereby that the right or title even of third person extinguishes and vests in the State. It has
been submitted that in so far as the Levy Orders are concerned, all the abovementioned ingredients
are satisfied. The millers may be holding the foodgrain belonging to the farmers or others who may
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 10Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
have given it for custom milling but still the millers will have to part with certain percentage of the
stock irrespective of the fact that they do not have right or title over such foodgrains. He has also
referred to different Levy Orders to indicate that nothing is left to be decided between the two
parties and the levy foodgrain has to be given at a particular place, time and in definite quantities by
the millers or farmers, as the case may be, as provided under the Levy Order. The price is also fixed
under the Orders. Refusal to comply with the Order may make a person liable for prosecution, the
authorities have even power to make search and seizure for the purposes of implementation of the
Order. Therefore, no volition or area of consensual arrangement remains open between the parties.
The whole thing is predetermined under the Levy Orders issued by the State Government. Thus the
transaction amounts to acquisition of property.
29. In support of this contention, reliance has been placed on a case reported in AIR 1970 SC 2000
(Chittar Mat Narain Das v. Commissioner of Sales Tax). The case related to procurement of wheat
under the U. P. Wheat Procurement (Levy) Order, 1959. Under Clause 3 of the said Levy Order, it
was provided that every licensed dealer had to sell to the State, at the control price, 50 per cent of
wheat held by him in the stock at the time of commencement of the Order and 50 per cent of the
wheat procured or purchased by him everyday. Clause 4 provided for power of the authorities to
search or make seizure and to examine account books, etc. The relevant observations made by the
Honourable Supreme Court are as follows :
The Order, it is true, makes no provision in respect of the place and manner of supply
of wheat and payment of the controlled price. It contains a bald injunction to supply
wheat of the specified quantity day after day, and enacts that in default of compliance
the dealer is liable to be punished : it does not envisage any consensual arrangement.
It does not require the State Government to enter into even an informal contract. A
sale predicates a contract of sale of goods between persons competent to contract for
a price paid or promised : a transaction in which an obligation to supply goods is
imposed, and which does not involve an obligation to enter into a contract, cannot be
called a 'sale', even if the person supplying goods is declared entitled to the value of
goods, which is determined or determinable in the manner prescribed. Assuming that
between the licensed dealer and the Controller, there may be some arrangements
about the place and manner of delivery of* wheat, and the payment of 'controlled
price', the operation of Clause 3 does not on that account become contractual.
30. The Honourable Supreme Court in the above-noted case also did not approve the view taken by
the Full Bench of this Court reported in AIR 1970 All 518 (Ram Bilas Ram Gopal's case). The Full
Bench was considering the Levy Order under which the dealer was obliged to sell to the State certain
specified quantity of wheat on a fixed price, from the date of the commencement of the Order until
such time as the State Government otherwise directed. The delivery of the goods was to be made by
the dealer to the Regional Food Controller or any person authorised by him. There was no option
but to sell the wheat so far dealer was concerned and the State was to purchase the same. The Full
Bench took the view that all other details of the transactions were left open to negotiation; for
example, negotiations in respect of the time and the mode of payment of the price, the time and
mode of delivery of wheat and other conditions of the contract. It was also observed that it was open
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 11Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
to the State Government to say that from a particular date, it would not purchase the wheat. Thus
the Full Bench took the view that the element of volition was there and the parties concerned had to
come to an agreement in particular area which was left open. Thus whatever compulsive or coercive
force is used to bring about a transaction, ,it must be traced to legislation. This transaction was held
to be sale exigible to sales tax.
31. The Supreme Court in Chittar Mai's case AIR 1970 SC 2000 placed reliance upon AIR 1963 SC
1207 (New India Sugar Mills' case), where supplies were made by the factory owners under the
allotments made by the Sugar Controller of India to different States; it was observed that the
despatches of sugar pursuant to the directions of the Controller were not made in pursuance of the
contract for sale. There was no offer by the suppliers, nor any acceptance by the State of Madras.
The suppliers had no volition in the matter. The transaction was held not to be sale so as to be
exigible to tax under the Sales Tax Act. This was the view taken by the majority with Mr. Justice
Hidayatullah, as he then was, delivering a dissenting judgment. The Honourable Supreme Court
thus found in the case of Chittar Mai AIR 1970 SC 2000 that the Order ignored the volition of the
dealer and there was no contract between the dealer and the State; hence the transaction did not
amount to sale and, therefore, not exigible to sales tax.
32. The learned counsel for the petitioner referred to the definition of "sale" given under the Sale of
Goods Act. It has been submitted that there has to be an agreement to sell before a sale takes place.
There should be an offer and acceptance and unless the parties agree exercising their volition in the
matter, there cannot be any sale. He has referred to AIR 1958 SC 660 (State of Madras v. Gannon
Dunkerley and Company). In that case, the question related to the goods used by a contractor during
the course of execution of a contract for construction of a building. The material used by the
contractor, would amount to sale or could be included in the turnover of the company, was the
question under consideration of the Honourable Supreme Court. It was held not to be a sale and it
was observed that sale of goods has essential ingredient of existence of an agreement to sell for a
price and property passing therein pursuant to the agreement. The definition of "sale" given under
the Sale of Goods Act and Benjamin on "Sale", 8th Edition, page 3 show that for constituting a sale,
four elements must be there, viz., parties must be competent to contract; there must be mutual
assent; property is transferred from seller to buyer and price in money is paid or promised. The
learned counsel for the petitioner has also referred to [1955] AC 696 (Kirkness's case). On the basis
of the above decisions too, the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that there being no
agreement to sell preceding the transaction itself, the transaction was nothing but compulsory
acquisition and not a sale. He has also placed reliance on a case decided by the Punjab High Court
ILR 1976 (2) Punj 687 (Food Corporation of India v. State of Punjab). A Division Bench of the
Punjab High Court took the view that procurement of foodgrains by the States and their officers and
despatch of the same to the deficit States did not amount to "sale". This case followed the decision of
Chittar Mai Narain Das AIR 1970 SC 2000. The learned counsel then referred to AIR 1978 SC 449
(Vishnu Agencies' case) and submitted that it does not overrule the view taken in Chittar Mai's case
AIR 1970 SC 2000. In this connection, he has also referred to another Division Bench case of the
Punjab and Haryana High Court in Civil Writ Petition No. 1573 of 1983 (Food Corporation of India
v. State of Haryana [1987] 66 STC 7) decided on November 26, 1986. In this case, the question for
consideration before the court was as to whether after the decision of Vishnu Agencies' case AIR
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 12Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
1978 SC 449 by the Supreme Court, the earlier decision of the Punjab High Court reported in [1976]
38 STC 144 (Food Corporation of India v. State of Punjab) and the decision in Chittar Mai's case AIR
1970 SC 2000 anymore hold good. The Division Bench came to the conclusion that the Chittar Mai's
case AIR 1970 SC 2000 is not overruled to the extent it held that the levy transaction amounted to
compulsory acquisition of property and not a sale.
33. Shri V. Upadhyay, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the opposite parties, while refuting the
submission made on behalf of the petitioner, submitted that the transactions under the Levy Orders
amounted to "sale" and there was no compulsory acquisition of property. It has also been submitted
that an area of consensual arrangement still remains there between the parties and the element of
volition is not completely excluded under the Levy Orders. Thus the transaction amounted to sale. It
has also been submitted that the decision in Chittar Mai's case AIR 1970 SC 2000 stands practically
overruled and is no more a good law in view of the latter decision, namely, Vishnu Agencies' case
AIR 1978 SC 449. Another submission made is that after the Forty-sixth Amendment of the
Constitution by adding Clause (29A) to Article 366 and similar amendment in the U. P. Sales Tax
Act by Act No. 25 of 1985, the transactions in question are exigible to sales tax.
34. To fortify their submission, reliance has been placed by the opposite parties upon AIR 1978 SC
449 (Vishnu Agencies' case). We propose to come to this case later and before that we may refer to
other two cases which are : AIR 1972 SC 87 (Solar Jung Sugar Mills Ltd. v. State of Mysore). In this
case, the Sugarcane Control Order was under consideration under which certain fixed quantity of
sugarcane was required to be supplied by the sugarcane growers to the sugar mills on controlled
price. Further, the direction was that no sugarcane should be exported from the reserved area except
in accordance with the terms issued by the Central Government. One of the contentions raised was
that everything was fixed and decided under the Order and there was no volition left to the parties.
Therefore, the transactions taking place under the Sugarcane Control Order were out of the pale of
the definition of the word "sale" which necessarily implies consensus between the vendor and the
purchaser before the transaction takes place. The argument was repelled and after considering
certain decisions, their Lordships of the Honourable Supreme Court observed that the statutory
orders regulating supply and distribution of goods by and between the parties under the Control
Orders do not absolutely impinge on the freedom to enter into contract. It was further observed that
legislative measures or statutory provisions fixing the price, delivery, supply, restricting areas for
transactions are all within the realm of planning economic need ensuring production and
distribution of essential commodities and basic necessities of the community. The Honourable
Supreme Court further observed in para 38 of the judgment as under :
The complexity of modern activities and the consequent difficulty of providing for
every eventuality have shaken fervour for freedom of contract as there was during the
nineteenth century. The economic environment has changed. The individual freedom
is to be reconciled with adequate performance by the Government of its functions in a
highly organised society. Delimiting areas for transactions or parties or denoting
price for transactions are all within the area of individual freedom of contract with
limited choice.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 13Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
35. Their Lordships after considering the Control Order held that despite the fact that the parties
were certain under the Control Order as to who had to sell and purchase the sugarcane, the price
was fixed, the area was fixed, still it was found that there were areas in which the parties had
freedom to agree on certain things. Thus the transactions taking place under the Control Orders
were held to be "sale".
36. The next case relied upon is AIR 1976 SC 2478 (Oil and Natural Gas Commission v. State of
Bihar). The case of Solar Jung Sugar Mills Ltd. AIR 1972 SC 87 was followed in this case and it was
held that supplies made to the Indian Oil Corporation by the Oil and Natural Gas Commission under
the directions of the Central Government on a fixed price was "sale". Their Lordships of the
Supreme Court observed that any sale under the Control Orders is not as a result of the coercion.
The statute supplies the consensus and the modality of consensus is furnished by the statute. There
is privity of contract between the parties. The transaction is neither a gift nor an exchange nor a
hypothecation nor a loan. It is a transfer of property from one person to another for consideration.
The law presumes the assent when there is transfer of goods from one person to the other. The
Honourable Supreme Court further went on to observe, "a sale may not require the consensual
element and that there may, in truth, be a compulsory sale of property with which the owner is
compelled to part for a price against his will and the effect of the statute in such a case is to say that
the absence of the transferor's consent does not matter and the sale is to proceed without it. In truth,
transfer is brought into being which ex facie in all its essential characteristics is a transfer of sale".
37. On behalf of the petitioner, it was submitted, in respect of the above-noted two cases, namely,
Solar Jung Sugar Mills Ltd. AIR 1972 SC 87 and Oil and Natural Gas Commission case AIR 1976 SC
2478, that they stand on different footing inasmuch as there are two parties who enter into
transactions and who are brought together under the Control Orders. The Orders involved in the
two cases are not the Levy Orders. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner there is no
element of acquisition of property but those Orders only regulated the sale. In respect of Oil and
Natural Gas Commission case AIR 1976 SC 2478, it has been submitted that it is distinguishable also
because of Section 29 of the Oil and Natural Gas Commission Act. We think, no distinction can be
made on the ground of Section 29 of the Oil and Natural Gas Commission Act. It only provides that
the commission shall be deemed to be a company and shall be liable to pay such taxes which are
levied on the States by the Central Government. It does not provide that the transaction of supply of
crude oil by the commission to the corporation under the directions issued by the Central
Government would be construed as a sale.
38. We may now come to the next case, namely, AIR 1978 SC 449 (Vishnu Agencies case) which has
been pressed into service on behalf of the opposite parties, which, according to them, practically
overrules the decision rendered in the case of Chittar Mai Narain Das AIR 1970 SC 2000. The
Chittar Mai's case AIR 1970 SC 2000 had been decided following the case of New India Sugar Mills'
case AIR 1963 SC 1207, which in turn had followed the decision in Gannon Dunkerley's case AIR
1958 SC 560. According to the learned counsel for the opposite parties, Gannon Dunkerley's case
AIR 1958 SC 560 was decided in a different context having no application to the case in hand and it
had interpreted the definition of the word "sale" as provided under the Sale of Goods Act and
Benjamin on Sale. The Supreme Court in Vishnu Agencies case AIR 1978 SC 449 has specifically
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 14Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
overruled the view taken in New India Sugar Mills' case AIR 1963 SC 1207 and has approved the
minority view as expressed by Justice Hidayatullah, as he then was. We may, therefore, have to
examine as to how far the decision in Chittar Mai's case AIR 1970 SC 2000 holds good and to what
extent it has been overruled in Vishnu Agencies' case AIR 1978 SC 449. In Vishnu Agencies' case
AIR 1978 SC 449, two appeals were connected which had been disposed of together. One was by
M/s. Vishnu Agencies (Pvt.) Ltd. and the other by Dhanyalakshmi Rice Mills. Vishnu Agencies case
AIR 1978 SC 449 relates to the West Bengal Cement Control Act (26 of 1948) which regulated
production, supply and distribution of cement at a fair price. A Cement Control Order was passed
under the provisions of the Cement Control Act which .provided that no sale or purchase of cement
could be made except in accordance with the conditions contained in the order issued by the
Director of Consumer Goods, West Bengal or by officers authorised by him. The cement could be
purchased only by a permit-holder from the dealer specified therein at a fixed price. The manner of
payment and time of delivery of goods was also specified under the licence. Vishnu Agencies who
held the licence of a dealer under the Licensing Order, made supplies from time to time under the
specific orders issued by the authorities concerned which was sought to be taxed and the tax was
paid but subsequently the same was challenged in view of the decision of the Honourable Supreme
Court in New India Sugar Mills case AIR 1963 SC 1207 and on the basis of the same it was
contended that in view of the provisions of the Cement Control Act and the Cement Control Order,
no volition or area of bargaining was left to the parties nor there was any element of mutual consent
or agreement.
39. The other appeal, namely, Dhanyalakshmi Rice Mills related to the Andhra Pradesh Paddy
Procurement (Levy) Order under which paddy growers in the State were to sell the paddy to the
licensed agent appointed by the Government at a fixed price. It was held that the transaction
amounted to sale and was taxable. The appeal was preferred against the said order of the
Honourable High Court. In the judgment of the Honourable Supreme Court, there is an observation
in para 16 mentioning that counsel appearing in the Andhra Pradesh appeals agreed that the
decision in the Calcutta case would govern those appeals also. While holding that the transactions
under the Control Orders amount to sale, the Honourable Supreme Court observed in para 33 of the
judgment as under :
33. In order, therefore, to determine whether there was any agreement or
consensuality between the parties, we must have regard to their conduct at or about
the time when the goods changed hands. In the first place, it is not obligatory on a
trader to deal in cement nor on any one to acquire it. The primary fact, therefore, is
that the decision of the trader to deal in an essential commodity is volitional. Such
volition carries with it the willingness to trade in the commodity strictly on the terms
of the Control Orders. The consumer too, who is under no legal compulsion to
acquire or possess cement, decides as a matter of his volition to obtain it on the terms
of the permit or the order of allotment issued in his favour. That brings the two
parties together, one of whom is willing to supply the essential commodity and the
other to receive it. When the allottee presents his permit to the dealer, he signifies his
willingness to obtain the commodity from the dealer on the terms stated in the
permit. His conduct reflects his consent. And when, upon the presentation of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 15Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
permit, the dealer acts upon it, he impliedly agrees to supply the commodity to the
allottee on the terms by which he has voluntarily bound himself to trade in the
commodity. His conduct too reflects his consent. Thus, though both parties are
bound to comply with the legal requirements governing the transaction, they agree as
between themselves to enter into the transaction on statutory terms, one agreeing to
supply the commodity to the other on those terms and the other agreeing to accept it
from him on the very terms. It is, therefore, not correct to say that the transactions
between the appellant and the allottees are not consensual. They, with their free
consent, agreed to enter into the transactions.
40. It has further been observed in para 34 that though the terms of the transaction were mostly
predetermined by law, but still there was some area in which there was possibility of bargaining and
consensual arrangement. In that connection it was observed that it was open to the dealer to charge
lesser price or the parties could fix the time of delivery of goods. There was also a provision
conferring a right on the allottee to ask for weighment of goods which, according to the Honourable
Supreme Court, shows that the allottee could reject the goods if they were short in weight just as
indeed, he would have the undoubted right to reject them on the ground that they were not of the
requisite quality. The observation of the Honourable Supreme Court further is that though the areas
of the agreement were minimal, still the parties to the transactions had the freedom to bargain and
this circumstance was against the view that the transactions were not consensual. After considering
several decisions, their Lordships of the Honourable Supreme Court observed in para 39 of the
judgment about the decision in New India Sugar Mills case AIR 1963 SC 1207 as follows :
We are of the opinion that the true position in law is as is set out in the dissenting
judgment of Hidayatullah, J., and that the view expressed by Kapur and Shah, JJ., in
the majority judgment, with deference, cannot be considered as good law. Bachawat,
J., in Andhra Sugars [1968] 1 SCR 705 was, with respect, right in cautioning that the
majority judgment of Kapur and Shah, JJ., in New India Sugar Mills AIR 1963 SC
1207 'should not be treated as an authority for the proposition that there can be no
contract of sale under compulsion of a statute' (pages 715-716 of SCR) (at page 606 of
AIR). Rather than saying that, in view of the growing uncertainty of the true legal
position on the question, we are constrained to say, namely, that the majority
judgment in New India Sugar Mills AIR 1963 SC 1207 is not good law. Bachawat, J.,
preferred to adopt the not unfamiliar manner of confining the majority decision to
'the special facts of that case'.
41. About the decision in Gannon Dunkerley's case AIR 1958 SC 560, which was followed in New
India Sugar Mills case AIR 1963 SC 1207, their Lordships observed in para 40 of the judgment that
the decision in Gannon Dunkerley's case AIR 1958 SC 560 was in a different context and the enquiry
was only to a limited extent as to whether the material used by a building contractor ' during the
course of execution of the contract amounted to sale. It was held that it did not amount to sale in the
context of the definition of the word "sale" under the Sale of Goods Act and since the ingredients of
the "sale" were not present as laid down in Benjamin on Sale, therefore, no tax could be levied on
such material. The reasons given in Gannon Dunkerley's case AIR 1958 SC 560 for holding that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 16Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
using of material did not amount to "sale" has been summarised by the Honourable Supreme Court
in para 40 of the judgment where it has also been indicated that Gannon Dunkerley's case AIR 1958
SC 560 was not rightly followed in New India Sugar Mills case AIR 1963 SC 1207. The observations
are as follows :
Thus, the two reasons given by the court in support of its conclusion were, firstly, that
in a building contract there was no agreement, express or implied, to sell 'goods' and
secondly, that property in the building materials does not pass in the materials
regarded as 'goods' but it passes as part of immovable property. In New India Sugar
Mills [1963] 14 STC 316 (SC), the commodity with which the court was concerned was
sugar and was delivered as sugar just as in the instant case, the commodity with
which we are concerned is cement which was delivered as cement. That meets the
first reason in Gannon Dunkerley [1958] 9 STC 353 (SC). As regards the second, it is
quite clear that the tax was demanded after the commodity had changed hands or,
putting it in the words of the Sale of Goods law, after property in it had passed. With
great respect, therefore, the majority in New India Sugar Mills [1963] 14 STC 316
(SC) was in error in saying that 'the ratio decidendi of that decision [Gannon
Dunkerley [1958] 9 STC 353 (SC)] must govern this case'. The question before us
which was the very question involved in New India Sugar Mills [1963] 14 STC 316
(SC), viz., whether a transaction effected in accordance with the obligatory terms of a
statute can amount to a 'sale' did not arise in Gannon Dunkerley [1958] 9 STC 353
(SC).
42. Their Lordships of the Honourable Supreme Court have also in para 41 of the judgment referred
to the case [1955] AC 696 (Kirkness v. John Hudson and Company Ltd.) which was followed in
Gannon Dunkerley's case AIR 1958 SC 560. The court observed thus :
In fact, if we may say so with great respect, the observation in Gannon Dunkerley
[1958] 9 STC 353 (SC) that the decision in Kirkness [1955] AC 696 concluded the
question before the court seems to us somewhat wide of the mark. Since Kirkness
[1955] AC 696 involved an altogether different point, we would have avoided
referring to it but the reliance upon it in Gannon Dunkerley [1958] 9 STC 353 (SC)
may lead to a misunderstanding regarding its true ratio which needs to be clarified.
43. Their Lordships of the Honourable Supreme Court have thereafter observed that a more relevant
decision on the point would be [1962] Ch 376 (Ridge Nominees Ltd. v. Inland Revenue
Commissioners). In that case, under certain circumstances, the transfer of shares had to be executed
under the statutory provisions even against the consent of one of the parties. The question was
whether a transfer of shares under such circumstances was required to be stamped as a transfer on
sale. The question, therefore, was whether the transaction amounted to sale even though element of
mutual consent was totally absent. It was observed by Lord Evershed, M.R., that what the
Companies Act had done, by the machinery it had created, was that in truth it brought into being a
transaction which had apparently all characteristics of transfer on sale. While concurring with the
decision Donovan, L.J., observed that the dissent of the shareholder was overridden by an assent
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 17Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
which the statute imposed upon him though it may be fictional. Danckwerts, L.J., also concurring
with the judgment observed that a sale may not always require the consensual element and that
there may be a compulsory sale of property in which the owner is compelled to part with his
property against his will.
44. While dealing with the earlier decision in Chittar Mai's case AIR 1970 SC 2000, the Honourable
Supreme Court has observed in para 44 of the judgment as follows :
This decision is clearly distinguishable since the provisions of the Wheat
Procurement Order were construed by the court as being in the nature of compulsory
acquisition of property, obliging the dealer to supply wheat from day to day. Cases of
compulsory acquisition of property by the State stand on a different footing since
there is no question in such cases of offer and acceptance nor of consent, either
express or implied.
45. Further their Lordships of the Supreme Court in para 45 of the judgment clarified the position as
follows :
We would, however, like to clarify that though compulsory acquisition of property
would exclude the element of mutual assent which is vital to a sale, the learned
Judges were, with respect, not right in holding in Chittar Mai AIR 1970 SC 2000 that
even if in respect of the place of delivery and the place of payment of price, there
could be a consensual arrangement, the transaction will not amount to a sale (page
677 of SCR) (at page 2004 of AIR). The true position in law is as stated above,
namely, that so, long as mutual assent, express or implied, is not totally excluded the
transaction will amount to a sale. The ultimate decision in Chittar Mai [1970] 26 STC
344 (SC) can be justified only on the view that Clause 3 of. the Wheat Procurement
Order envisages compulsory acquisition of wheat by the State Government from the
licensed dealer. Viewed from this angle, we cannot endorse the court's criticism of the
Full Bench decision of the Allahabad High Court in Commissioner, Sales Tax, U.P. v.
Ram Bilas Ram Gopal AIR 1970 All. 518 which held while construing Clause 3 that so
long as there was freedom to bargain in some areas the transaction could amount to a
sale though effected under compulsion of a statute. Looking at the scheme of the U.P.
Wheat Procurement Order, particularly Clause 3 thereof, this court in Chittar Mai
[1970] 26 STC 344 seems to have concluded that the transaction was, in truth and
substance, in the nature of compulsory acquisition, with no real freedom to bargain
in any area. Shah, J., expressed the court's interpretation of Clause 3 in no uncertain
terms by saying that 'it did not envisage any consensual arrangement'.
46. From the above observations, what emerges out is that, no doubt, cases of compulsory
acquisition of property stand on different footings but in those transactions where there is some
area of consensual arrangement and some field for volition is left untouched by the legislation, the
transactions will take the colour of sale. The criticism of the Full Bench decision of this Court (AIR
1970 All. 518: Commissioner of Sales Tax, U.P. v. Ram Bilas Ram Gopal) in the case of Chittar Mal
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 18Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
AIR 1970 SC 2000 has not been approved by the Honourable Supreme Court in Vishnu Agencies'
case AIR 1978 SC 449. In other words, the view taken in the Full Bench decision of this Court was
approved where it was held that the sale made by a dealer to the Regional Food Controller under the
U. P. Wheat Procurement (Levy) Order, 1959 amounted to sale and exigible to sales tax. It was held
that a sale under the compulsion of a statute is still a sale. Whatever coercive force is used to bring
about the transaction must be traced to legislation. It cannot be attributed to the State Government
as a party to the transaction. The terms of the contract, it has been observed, are supplied by the
statute.
47. In our opinion, it is clear that the decision in Chittar Mai's case AIR 1970 SC 2000 does not hold
good in view of Vishnu Agencies' case AIR 1978 SC 449, in respect of transactions where there still
remains some area of consensual arrangement. In this regard with due respect we are unable to
agree with the decision of the Punjab High Court in Writ Petition No. 1573 of 1983 (Food
Corporation of India v. State of Haryana [1987] 66 STC 7). From the different decisions and
observations made therein it clearly comes out that there may be compulsory sales even against the
wishes and consent of one of the parties, still the transaction may amount to sale. In such cases the
dissent is overridden by an assent supplied by the statute. The statute brings the two parties
together, restricting their area of consensual agreement howsoever minimal it may be, none the less
property passes on to the purchaser for a price which is the essential feature of "sale"; therefore,
such transaction amounts to "sale". So we may have to find out if there is any volition left with the
parties or not in the case in hand.
48. To show that area of volition between the parties still existed despite restrictions placed under
the Levy Orders, learned counsel for the opposite parties has first submitted that there is no
provision regarding mode of payment of price of the foodgrains which were purchased under the
Levy Orders. Therefore, it was open to the parties to settle their own terms and conditions regarding
manner and mode of payment. Next it has been pointed out that it was open to the Food
Corporation of India to reject the foodgrains offered by the State Government if it thought that the
foodgrains did not conform to the standard of quality as required by it. In this connection, an
averment has been made in para 13 of the counter-affidavit filed on behalf of the opposite parties by
Sri R. B. Agarwal stating therein that the petitioner had rejected 142 metric tonnes of wheat which
was offered by the State Government. This, according to the opposite parties shows that the
petitioner reserved the right to accept or reject the offer of the State Government in the
circumstances mentioned above. A reply to the said averment has been made in para 12(e) of the
rejoinder affidavit on behalf of the petitioner through Sri S. R. Singh wherein it has been stated that
the Food Corporation of India rejects and does not accept the foodgrains which are not in
accordance with the specifications fixed by the Government of India. So far rejection of 142 metric
tonnes of wheat is concerned, it has been said that the quantity was just a drop in the ocean.
However, it appears that on the second thought the petitioner tried to explain this matter in its
supplementary affidavit dated 20th May, 1986 sworn by Sri S. R. Singh. In this supplementary
affidavit it has been stated that the opposite parties did not aver in the counter-affidavit that 142
metric tonnes of wheat pertained to levy transaction, and in respect of non-lifting of 47 metric
tonnes of rice it has been stated that it was advance levy which was taken by the State Government;
therefore, it was not lifted. However, it has been accepted in para 4 that the Food Corporation of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 19Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
India is bound to accept the levy foodgrains provided they are of the prescribed specifications. So a
total sum of situation which emerges out is that some area of consensual arrangement still remains;
that is to say, if the Food Corporation of India is not satisfied about the quality of the foodgrain, it
has a right to reject the same. In the case of Vishnu Agencies [1978] 42 STC 31; AIR 1978 SC 449,
their Lordships of the Supreme Court had discussed various conditions as contained in the Control
Order, while considering the question of area of consensual arrangement and volition between the
parties to the transactions. One of the clauses taken into account was related to weighment of goods.
The observations in that connection are as follows :
Paragraph 8A which confers on the allottee the right to ask for weighment of goods
also shows that he may reject the goods on the ground that they are short in weight
just as indeed, he would have the undoubted right to reject them on the ground that
they are not of the requisite quality. The circumstance that in these areas, though
minimal, the parties to the transactions have the freedom to bargain militates against
the view that the transactions are not consensual.
49. In para 46 of the judgment in Vishnu Agencies' case AIR 1978 SC 449, their Lordships of the
Supreme Court while considering the case of Solar Jung Sugar Mills Ltd. AIR 1972 SC 87, took note
of the fact that the Control Orders had left to the parties the option in regard to taking higher
quantity than stipulated in the Orders, a higher price than the minimum fixed as also the form and
manner of payment. It was further observed that a factory could reject goods after inspection which
indicated not only freedom in the formation but also in the performance of the contract.
50. The above observation of the Honourable Supreme Court leaves no room for doubt that area of
consensual arrangement did exist between the parties. In the Full Bench case, Commissioner of
Sales Tax v. Ram Bilas Ram Gopal AIR 1970 All. 518 which has implied approval of the Supreme
Court in Vishnu Agencies' case AIR 1978 SC 449, one of the circumstances taken into account was
that one of the parties to the transaction, namely, the State Government, had option to say or decide
when it will stop purchasing wheat from the dealer. So it was a matter left open to one of the parties.
Same is the position in the present case. The question of mode of payment of price was also taken
into account in the abovementioned Full Bench decision in Ram Bilas Ram Gopal AIR 1970 All. 518.
Therefore, it cannot be said that the area of consensual arrangement is absolutely excluded in the
levy transactions.
51. It has next been vehemently urged that the millers are required to part with a certain percentage
of their stocks irrespective of the fact that whether the foodgrains belong to the millers or not. The
stock of miller may include such stock of foodgrains which may have been handed over by the
farmers or other persons for hulling. This, according to the learned counsel for the petitioner, is one
of the strong ingredients to establish that the transaction amounts to acquisition of property,
otherwise ordinarily a person can sell only the property in which he has his right and title. The
argument at the first sight appears to be fascinating but we find that it is devoid of any merit. As a
matter of fact, the Levy Orders prescribe a mode of taking delivery of foodgrains through the millers
even though goods may not belong to them. It is only title of the owner of the food-grains which
passes on to the State Government and the price in turn is actually paid to the owner of the property
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 20Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
through the millers. The millers are only the medium in the transaction through whom the required
quantity of foodgrains passes on to the State Government. The provisions of the Zamindari
Abolition and Land Reforms Act and the Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings Act, etc., which
have been referred to provide for automatic vesting of rights in the State Government from a
particular date. Nothing further is required to be done for passing on the title and the effect of the
statutory provision automatically takes effect divesting a person of his right and title and vesting of
the same in the State. But that is not so under the Levy Orders of the foodgrains. As observed earlier,
we find that the millers are only a medium for passing on the foodgrains of the farmers or other
persons to the Slate. May be that it has been provided for the sake of convenience in taking delivery
of foodgrains. We are, therefore, of the view that only this feature of the Levy Orders, viz., taking of
stock of foodgrains from millers, does not convert the sale transaction into acquisition of property.
52. On behalf of the opposite parties Sri V. Upadhyay has next submitted that in the case of Gannon
Dunkerley AIR 1958 SC 560 and other subsequent cases which have followed the said case, the
interpretation of the word "sale" was done on the basis of the definition of the word "sale" under the
Sales Tax Act and the Sale of Goods Act but there has been constitutional amendment as well as
amendments in the U. P. Sales Tax Act as a result of which transactions under the Levy Orders are
covered under the term "sale" without there being any room for doubt. It has further been submitted
that the amendment was necessitated because of interpretation of "sale" as given in different cases
by the Honourable Supreme Court.
53. By means of the Constitution '(Forty-sixth Amendment) Act, 1982, Clause (29A) has been
inserted after Clause (29) of Article 366 of the Constitution. The newly added Clause (29A) is as
follows :
(29A) 'tax on the sale or purchase of goods' includes-
(a) a tax on the transfer, otherwise than in pursuance of a contract, of property in any
goods for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;
(b) a tax on the transfer of property in goods (whether as goods or in some other
form) involved in the execution of a works contract;
(c) a tax on the delivery of goods on hire-purchase or any system of payment by
instalments;
(d) a tax on the transfer of the right to use any goods for any purpose (whether or not
for a specified period) for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;
(e) a tax on the supply of goods by any unincorporated association or body of persons
to a member thereof for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;
(f) a tax on the supply, by way of or as part of any service or in any other manner
whatsoever, of goods, being food or any other article for human consumption or any
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 21Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
drink (whether or not intoxicating), where such supply or service, is for cash,
deferred payment or other valuable consideration, and such transfer, delivery or
supply of any goods shall be deemed to be a sale of those goods by the person making
the transfer, delivery or supply and a purchase of those goods by the person to whom
such transfer, delivery or supply is made.
54. Learned counsel for the opposite parties has placed before us the Statement of Objects and
Reasons for passing the Forty-sixth Amendment Act, which reads as follows :
"Statement of Objects and Reasons Sales tax laws enacted in pursuance of the
Government of India Act, 1935, as also the laws relating to sales tax passed after the
coming into force of the Constitution proceeded on the footing that the expression
'sale of goods', having regard to the rule as to broad interpretation of entries in the
legislative lists, would be given a wider connotation. However, in Gannon
Dunkerley's case AIR 1958 SC 560, the Supreme Court held that the expression 'sale
of goods' as used in the entries in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution has the
same meaning as in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. This decision related to works
contracts.
2. By a series of subsequent decisions, the Supreme Court has, on the basis of the
decision in Gannon Dunkerley's case [1958] 9 STC 353 (SC), held various other
transactions which resemble, in substance, transactions by way of sales, to be not
liable to sales tax. As a result of these decisions, a transaction, in order to be subject
to the levy of sales tax under entry 92A of the Union List or entry 54 of the State List,
should have the following ingredients, namely, parties competent to contract, mutual
assent and transfer of property in goods from one of the parties to the contract to the
other party thereto for a price.
3. This position has resulted in scope for avoidance of tax in various ways. An
example of this is the practice of inter-State consignment transfers, i.e., transfer of
goods from head office or a principal in one State to a branch or agent in another
State or vice versa or transfer of goods on consignment account, to avoid the payment
of sales tax on inter-State sales under the Central Sales Tax Act. While in the case of a
works contract, if the contract treats the sale of materials separately from the cost of
the labour, the sale of materials would be taxable, but in the case of an indivisible
works contract, it is not possible to levy sales tax on the transfer of property in the
goods involved in the execution of such contract as it has been held that there is no
sale of the materials as such and the property in them does not pass as movables.
Though practically the purchaser in a hire-purchase agreement gets the goods on the
date of the hire-purchase, it has been held that there is sale only when the purchaser
exercises the option to purchase at a much later date and therefore only the
depreciated value of the goods involved in such transaction at the time the option to
purchase is exercised becomes assessable to sales tax. Similarly, while sale by a
registered club or other association of persons (the club or association of persons
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 22Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
having corporate status) to its members is taxable, sales by an unincorporated club or
association of persons to its members is not taxable as such club or association, in
law, has no separate existence from that of the members. In the Associated Hotels of
India case AIR 1972 SC 1131, the Supreme Court held that there is no sale involved in
the supply of food or drink by a hotelier to a person lodged in the hotel.
4. In the New India Sugar Mills case AIR 1963 SC 1207, the Supreme Court took the
view that in the transfer of controlled commodities in pursuance of a direction under
a Control Order, the element of volition by the seller, or mutual assent, is absent and,
therefore, there is no sale as defined in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. However, in Oil
and Natural Gas Commission v. State of Bihar AIR 1976 SC 2478, the Supreme Court
had occasion to consider its earlier decisions with regard to the liability of transfers of
controlled commodities to be charged to sales tax. The Supreme Court held that
where there are any statutory compulsions, the statute itself should be treated as
supplying the consensus and furnishing the modality of the consensus. In Vishnu
Agencies v. Commercial Tai Officer AIR 1978 SC 449, six of the seven Judges
concurred in overruling the decision in New India Sugar Mills case [1963] 14 STC 316
(SC) while the seventh Judge held the case to be distinguishable. It is, therefore,
considered desirable to put the matter beyond any doubt.
5. The various problems connected with the power of the States to levy a tax on the
sale of goods and with the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, were referred to the Law
Commission of India. The Commission considered these matters in their Sixty-first
Report and, recommended inter alia certain amendments in the Constitution if as a
matter of administrative policy it is decided to levy tax on transactions of the nature
mentioned in the preceding paragraphs.
6. Device by way of lease of films has also been resulting in avoidance of sales tax.
The main right in regard to a film relates to its exploitation and after exploitation for
a certain period of time, in most cases, the film ceases to have any value. It is,
therefore, seen that instead of resorting to the outright sale of a film, only a lease or
transfer of the right to exploitation is made.
7. There were reports from State Governments to whom revenues from sales tax have
been assigned, as to the large scale avoidance of Central sales tax leviable on
inter-State sales of goods through the device of consignment of goods from one State
to another and as to the leakage of local sales tax in works contracts, hire-purchase
transactions, lease of films, etc. Though Parliament could levy a tax on these
transactions, as tax on sales has all along been treated as an item of revenue to be
assigned to the States, in regard to these transactions which resemble sales also, it is
considered that the same policy should be adopted.
8. Besides the abovementioned matters, a new problem has arisen as a result of the
decision of the Supreme Court in Northern India Caterers (India) Ltd. v. Lt. Governor
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 23Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
of Delhi AIR 1978 SC 1591. States have been proceeding on the basis that the
Associated Hotels of India case [1972] 29 STC 474 (SC) was applicable only to supply
of food or drink by a hotelier to a person lodged in the hotel and that tax was leviable
on the sale of food-stuffs by a restaurant. But overruling the decision of the Delhi
High Court, the Supreme Court has held in the above case that service of meals
whether in a hotel or restaurant does not constitute a sale of food for the purpose of
levy of sales tax but must be regarded as the rendering of a service in the satisfaction
of a human need or ministering to the bodily want of human beings. It would not
make any difference whether the visitor to the restaurant is charged for the meal as a
whole or according to each dish separately.
9. It is, therefore, proposed to suitably amend the Constitution to include in Article
366 a definition of 'tax on the sale or purchase of goods' by inserting a new Clause
(29A). The definition would specifically include within the scope of that expression
tax on-
(i) transfer for consideration of controlled commodities;
(ii) the transfer of property in goods involved in the execution of a works contract;
(iii) delivery of goods on hire-purchase or any system of payment by instalments;
(iv) transfer of the right to use any goods for any purpose for cash, deferred payment
or other valuable consideration;
(v) the supply of goods by an unincorporated association or body of persons to a
member thereof for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;
(vi) the supply, by way of or as part of any service, of food or any drink for cash,
deferred payment or other valuable consideration. (see Clause 4).
10. A new entry is sought to be inserted in the Union List in the Seventh Schedule as entry 92B, to
enable the levy of tax on the consignment of goods where such consignment takes place in the
course of inter-State trade or commerce, (see Clause 5).
11. Clause (1) of Article 269 is proposed to be amended so that the tax levied on the consignment of
goods in the course of inter-State trade or commerce shall be assigned to the States. Clause (3) of
that article is proposed to be amended to enable Parliament to formulate by law principles for
determining when a consignment of goods takes place in the course of inter-State trade or
commerce, (see Clause 2).
12. Clause (3) of Article 286 is proposed to be amended to enable Parliament to specify, by law,
restrictions and conditions in regard to the system of levy, rates and other incidents of the tax on the
transfer of goods involved in the execution of a works contract, on the delivery of goods on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 24Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
hire-purchase or any system of payment by instalments and on the right to use any goods, (see
Clause 3).
13. The proposed amendments would held in the augmentation of the State revenues to a
considerable extent. Clause 6 of the Bill seeks to validate laws levying tax on the supply of food or
drink for consideration and also the collection or recoveries made by way of tax under any such law.
However, no sales tax will be payable on food or drink supplied by a hotelier to a person lodged in
the hotel during the period from the date of the judgment in the Associated. Hotels of India case
[1972] 29 STC 474 (SC) and the commencement of the present Amendment Act if the conditions
mentioned in Sub-clause (2) of Clause 6 of the Bill are satisfied. In the case of food or drink supplied
by restaurants this relief will be available only in respect of the period after the date of judgment in
the Northern India Caterers (India) Limited case [1978] 42 STC 386 (SC) and the commencement of
the present Amendment Act.
14. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects.
55. Clause 6 of the Amendment Act has also been referred to, which is a validation and exemption
clause. Clause 6 reads as follows :
6. Validation and exemption.-(1) For the purposes of every provision of the
Constitution in which the expression 'tax on the sale or purchase of goods' occurs,
and for the purposes of any law passed or made, or purporting to have been passed or
made, before the commencement of this Act, in pursuance of any such provision,-
(a) the said expression shall be deemed to include, and shall be deemed always to
have included, a tax (hereafter in this section referred to as the aforesaid tax) on the
supply, by way of or as part of any service or in any other manner whatsoever, of
goods, being food or any other article for human consumption or any drink (whether
or not intoxicating) for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration; and
(b) every transaction by way of supply of the nature referred to in Clause (a) made
before such commencement shall be deemed to be, and shall be deemed always to
have been, a transaction by way of sale, with respect to which the person making such
supply is the seller and the person to whom such supply is made, is the purchaser,
and notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court, tribunal or
authority, no law which was passed or made before such commencement and. which
imposed or authorised the imposition of, or purported to impose or authorise the
imposition of, the aforesaid tax shall be deemed to be invalid or ever to have been
invalid on the ground merely that the legislature or other authority passing or making
such law did not have competence to pass or make such law, and accordingly :-
(i) all the aforesaid taxes levied or collected or purporting to have been levied or
collected under any such law before the commencement of this Act shall be deemed
always to have been validly levied or collected in accordance with law;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 25Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
(ii) no suit or other proceeding' shall be maintained or continued in any court or
before any tribunal or authority for the refund of, and no enforcement shall be made
by any court, tribunal or authority of any decree or order directing the refund of, any
such aforesaid tax which has been collected;
(iii) recoveries shall be made in accordance with the provisions of such law of all
amounts which would have been collected thereunder as such aforesaid tax if this
section had been in force at all material times.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (1), any supply of the nature
referred to therein shall be exempt from the aforesaid tax-
(a) where such supply has been made, by any restaurant or eating house (by whatever
name called), at any time on or after the 7th day of September, 1978, and before the
commencement of this Act and the aforesaid tax has not been collected on such
supply on the ground that no such tax could have been levied or collected at that
time; or
(b) where such supply, not being any such supply by any restaurant or eating house
(by whatever name called), has been made at any time on or after the 4th day of
January, 1972, and before the commencement of this Act and the aforesaid tax has
not been collected on such supply on the ground that no such tax could have been
levied or collected at that time :
Provided that the burden of proving that the aforesaid tax was not collected on any
supply of the nature referred to in Clause (a) or, as the case may be, Clause (b), shall
be on the person claiming the exemption under this sub-section.
(3) For the removal of doubts, it is hereby declared that,-
(a) nothing in Sub-section (1) shall be construed as preventing any person-
(i) from questioning in accordance with the provisions of any law referred to in that
sub-section, the assessment, reassessment, levy or collection of the aforesaid tax, or
(ii) from claiming refund of the aforesaid tax paid by him in excess of the amount due
from him under any such law; and
(b) no act or omission on the part of any person, before the commencement of this
Act, shall be punishable as an offence which would not have been so punishable if
this Act had not come into force.
56. The U.P. Sales Tax Act was also similarly amended by Act No. 25 of 1985. By means of this
amendment,, Clause (h) of Section 2 of the U. P. Sales Tax Act has been substituted as follows :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 26Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
(h) 'sale', with its grammatical variations and cognate expressions, means any
transfer of property, in goods (otherwise than by way of a mortgage, hypothecation,
charge or pledge) for cash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration, and
includes-
(i) a transfer, otherwise than in pursuance of a contract, of property in any goods for
cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;
(ii) a transfer of property in goods (whether as goods or in some other form) involved
in the execution of a works contract;
(iii) the delivery of goods on hire-purchase or any system of payment by instalments;
(iv) a transfer of the right to use any goods for any purpose (whether or not for a
specified period) for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;
(v) the supply of goods by any unincorporated association or body of persons to a
member thereof for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration; and
(vi) the supply, by way of or as part of any service or in any other manner whatsoever,
of goods, being food or any other article for human consumption or any drink
(whether or not intoxicating) where such supply or service is for cash, deferred
payment or other valuable consideration;.
57. The amendment was effected with effect from 13th September, 1985. There is also a validation
clause which is Clause 17. It reads as follows:
17. Validation.-(1) Notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court or
other authority, anything done or any action taken before the commencement of this
section, which conforms to the provisions of the principal Act, as amended by this
Act, shall be deemed to be and always to have been valid and lawful as if the
provisions of this Act were in force at all material times.
(2) Where, before the commencement of this section, any court or authority has, in any proceeding,
made any assessment, levy or collection of any tax, or passed any order imposing any penalty or
making any other demand under the principal Act, or passed any order modifying, setting aside or
quashing (wholly or in part) such assessment, levy, collection, penalty or demand and such
assessment or other order becomes, in consequence of the provisions of this Act, inconsistent with
the provisions of the principal Act as amended by this Act, then, subject to the provisions of
Sub-section (3), any party to the proceeding or the Commissioner of Sales Tax may, within six
months from the date of such commencement, make an application to such court or authority for a
review of the assessment or order, and thereupon such court or authority may review the proceeding
and make such order, varying or revising the order previously made, as may be necessary to give
effect to the provisions of this Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 27Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
(3) The assessing, appellate or revising authority, as the case may be, may, within a period of one
year from the commencement of this section or within the period specified in Section 22 of the
principal Act, whichever expires later, make any rectification in any order passed by it where such
rectification becomes necessary in consequence of the amendment of the principal Act by this Act :
Provided that no rectification, which has the effect of enhancing the assessment,
penalty or other dues, shall be made unless the authority concerned has given notice
to the dealer or the person concerned of his intention to do so and has allowed him a
reasonable opportunity of being heard.
58. On the basis of amendments in the Constitution and the U. P. Sales Tax Act referred to above, it
has been submitted on behalf of the opposite parties that the transactions which take place under
the Levy Orders are fully covered as sales under Sub-clause (a) of Clause (29A) of Article 366 of the
Constitution and under Clause (h) of Section 2 of the U. P. Sales Tax Act. Transfer of property in
goods otherwise than in pursuance of a contract is included in the definition of the word "sale".
Therefore, by the above inclusion the definition of "sale" as given under the Sale of Goods Act, to the
extent it does not include such transactions, does not hold good for the purposes of the U. P. Sales
Tax Act. It has further been submitted that the earlier cases relate to the definition of the word "sale"
as it then stood. It may not be necessary to refer to those cases for the purposes of the meaning of
the word "sale" after amendment. If a transaction or transfer of property in goods is covered under
Clause (h) of Section 2 of the U. P. Sales Tax Act, then such transaction would be exigible to tax. We
find that in the earlier decisions the main emphasis for not holding a transaction a "sale" was on the
ground that there was no contract preceding the sale, which is a necessary ingredient of "sale"
according to the definition of "sale" under the Sale of Goods Act and "Benjamin on Sale" as relied
upon by the Honourable Supreme Court in the case of Gannon Dunkerley AIR 1958 SC 560.
However, we have already noted that in some of the decisions, referred to earlier, it has been held
that the consent to a transaction can be provided under the statute or dissent of a party to
transaction of sale may be overridden by the statutory provisions. The contention of the opposite
parties is that such a doubt which was lingering in respect of certain transactions has been removed
by a clear provision about the meaning of the word "sale" by means of a constitutional provision as
well as by subsequently amended provision under the U. P. Sales Tax Act.
59. It has been submitted on .behalf of the opposite parties that the vires of the amended
constitutional provision and the amended provision of the U. P. Sales Tax Act has not been
challenged. That is to say, the competence of the legislature to define the word "sale" as it has been
done is not in dispute nor the substantive amended provision is under challenge; therefore, a
transfer of property in goods otherwise than in pursuance of a contract would mean "sale" as
included in the definition. This position would lead to the conclusion that the petitioner does not
and cannot object to the transactions under the Levy Orders amounting to sale for the reason of lack
of agreement between the parties. It has been submitted that the transfer of property in goods does
take place in the transactions under the Levy Orders for price. Whatever controversy existed earlier
about such transactions, it has come to an end.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 28Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
60. Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted, no doubt that the validity of the amended
provision has not been challenged but still the transactions under the Levy Orders would not be
covered under the amended definition of the word "sale". He has again emphasised that the
transaction under the Levy Order amounts to acquisition of property and not sale. It has been
submitted that the compulsory acquisition and the sale are undisputedly two different concepts and
connote different kinds of transactions. It has also been pointed out that these two different terms
have been differently used in the Constitution under entry 54 of List II of the Seventh Schedule and
entry 42 of List III of the Seventh Schedule. We have already made a reference to those entries in the
earlier part of this judgment. Then reliance has been placed upon the observation made by the
Honourable Supreme Court in Vishnu Agencies' case AIR 1978 SC 449 wherein it has been observed
that the cases of compulsory acquisition stand on different footing. On this basis, it has been
submitted that if transactions under the Levy Orders amount to acquisition of property, then such
transactions would not be governed by the amended definition of the word "sale". In this
connection, he has referred to the use of the word "transfer" occurring in Sub-clause (a) of Clause
(29A) of Article 366 of the Constitution. It has been submitted that acquisition of property does not
involve transfer. We are afraid, the argument is fallacious. The title in the property does pass on to
the State in the cases of compulsory acquisition and such passing on of the title is nothing but
transfer of rights and title of the holder of property. We have already held earlier that transactions
under the Levy Orders do not amount to compulsory acquisition.
61. It has then been submitted that latter part of Clause (29A) of Article 366 refers to transfer,
delivery or supply of goods, meaning thereby that there has to be a transferor. Under the said
provision a person making the transfer is deemed to have made the "sale" and purchase of those
goods is made by one to whom the transfer, delivery or supply is made. It has been submitted that in
levy transactions the millers have to transfer the foodgrains to the procuring agency though such
foodgrains may not belong to them. Ordinarily a transferor cannot convey a title better than what he
possesses. This is only in the cases of compulsory acquisition that the property vests in the State
irrespective of right, title or encumbrances of the transferor or other parties. We have already dealt
with this submission of the petitioner and we cannot lose sight of the fact that the amended
provisions relate to inclusive definition and deemed "sale" of goods. In such matters, some element
of fiction is necessarily there. That is to say, a certain thing or position is presumed for some specific
purpose though actually it may not be there. Therefore, to test whether a transaction falls within the
inclusive definition is not to be judged on the basis of general principle or ingredients of the term
involved but on the basis of definition as provided in the statute.
62. It was then submitted that the word "transfer" used under the new definition of the word "sale"
should partake its colour and character of the nature of sale. It has been submitted that a general
term takes colour from specific term used. In this connection, he has cited a case reported in AIR
1973 SC 1293 (S.P. Watel v. State of U.P.) and has also referred to the Legislation and Interpretation
by Jagdish Swaroop, page 117, 1974 Edition. Reliance has also been placed on AIR 1957 SC 18 (Ram
Narain v. State of Uttar Pradesh). There is no dispute with the proposition that a word has to be
given meaning keeping in view the context in which it is used and the company of other words which
it keeps. But in our view, the question of searching such meaning arises when there is vagueness in
the meaning of the word to be interpreted or there is some doubt about the same and it may not be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 29Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
possible to have the plain meaning on the bare reading of the provision. We find no such ambiguity
in this case. The inclusive definition has been provided for the word "sale" and there seems to be no
difficulty in holding that where property in goods is transferred even though without in pursuance of
a contract, for a price or consideration that would be "sale".
63. It has then been submitted that while making the amendment, the legislature did not have in its
mind the levy transactions. In different paragraphs of the Statement of Objects and Reasons for
inserting Clause (29A) to Article 366 of the Constitution, different cases decided by the Supreme
Court and different situations sought to be met were mentioned, e.g., about supply of food-stuffs,
transactions of hire-purchase and material used in building contract, etc., but there was no mention
of Chittar Mai's case AIR 1970 SC 2000 or about levy transactions. Thus there was no intention to
cover levy transactions by means of the said amendment. We are afraid, it may not be necessary for
us to go into the question of intention of the legislature as it would be necessary only in those cases
where there is any doubt or ambiguity about the meaning of Sub-clause (a) of Clause (29A) of Article
366 or Clause (h) to Section 2 of the U. P. Sales Tax Act. In any case, we note that mention of Vishnu
Agencies' case AIR 1978 SC 449 and New India Sugar Mills' case AIR 1963 SC 1207 is certainly
there. In Vishnu Agencies' case AIR 1978 SC 449, all the cases, namely, the cases of Chittar Mal AIR
1970 SC 2000, Gannon Dunkerley AIR 1958 SC 560 and New India Sugar Mills AIR 1963 SC 1207,
etc., had been considered. Therefore, the omission to specifically mention the case of Chittar Mal
AIR 1970 SC 2000 is immaterial. We are, therefore, not of the view that the definition as it stands,
does not cover the levy transactions. So long as the amended provisions remain unchallenged and
stand as they are, it would be difficult to hold that the transactions under the Levy Orders would not
be covered under the said amended definition of "sale" which includes a transaction of transfer of
property in goods otherwise than in pursuance of a contract for cash payment or consideration, etc.
We find that this amendment was not taken into consideration by the Division Bench of the Punjab
High Court in Writ Petition No. 1573 of 1983 (Food Corporation of India, Karnal v. State of Haryana
[1987] 66 STC 7).
64. Learned counsel for the opposite parties, Sri V.B. Upadhyay, has referred to a decision of this
Court 1985 ATJ 585 (Pandit Restaurant v. State of U.P.). In this case, it appears that M/s. Pandit
Restaurant had challenged the assessment on the ground that there was no sale when food or drink
is supplied to a guest staying in a hotel as held in AIR 1978 SC 1591 [Northern India Caterers (India)
Ltd. v. Lt. Governor of Delhi]. However, such a supply made to the guest was included as "sale" by
an amendment in Article 366 of the Constitution and U. P. Act No. 25 of 1985. In this case it was
also considered whether such amendment could retrospectively be made or not. The Division Bench
of this Court upheld the validity of amending Act No. 25 of 1985 as well as upheld the retrospectivity
of the amended provision. A reference was also made to an unreported decision of this Court by
Honourable Mr. Justice N. D. Ojha, as he then was, in Sales Tax Revision No. 171 of 1983 and Sales
Tax Revision No. 184 of 1983 (Commissioner, Sales Tax, U.P. v. Rajpur Brothers), decided on 25th
April, 1984. It appears that certain restaurant owners had challenged the levy of sales tax on items
supplied to the customers, e.g., sweets, tea, poori, etc., on the strength of decision in Northern India
Caterers' case AIR 1978 SC 1591. It appears that when these revisions were decided, the Forty-sixth
Amendment of the Constitution had taken place as a result of which Clause (29A) to Article 366 of
the Constitution was added but a similar amendment under the U. P. Sales Tax Act had not yet
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 30Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
taken place. This Court had taken the view that although the definition of "sale" as then stood under
the Sales Tax Act was not the same, yet it was covered by the definition of the word "sale" as
amended under Clause (29A) of Article 366 of the Constitution of India and the items were found to
be exigible to sales tax.
65. On the question of amendment we may refer to para 49 onwards in the judgment of the Vishnu
Agencies' case AIR 1978 SC 449 where necessity to amend and change the laws, in keeping with
times, has been commented upon. In this connection, para 51 may be usefully reproduced as under:
Anson is perhaps over-optimistic in saying that there has been a fundamental change
in social outlook and in the legislative policy towards contract. Anyway, with the high
ideals of the preamble and the directive principles of our Constitution there has to be
such a fundamental change in judicial outlook. Instances given in Cheshire and
Anson have their parallels in India too, wherein freedom of contract has largely
become an illusion. The policy of our Parliament in regard to contracts, including
those involved in sale of goods, has still to reflect recognition of the necessity for a
change, which could be done by a suitable modification of the definition of 'sale' of
goods.
66. It is evident that it was expressed quite early by the Honourable Supreme Court that there was
necessity to amend the definition of the word "sale" which has ultimately been done by the
forty-sixth amendment. Developing concepts shall definitely take their place which is irresistible due
to changing circumstances, needs and requirements of the society. Something which may have
withstood test of time two centuries ago, may not necessarily hold good today due to vast
socio-economic changes as well as change in outlook and obligations of the State. With the change of
definition of the word "sale" in the Constitution and by the U. P. Amendment Act, the whole position
stands changed and transactions covered under the Levy Orders squarely fall within the inclusive
definition of the word "sale".
67. On behalf of the petitioners, explanation II to Sub-section (1) of Section 3-D of the U. P. Sales
Tax Act has also been challenged. Before reproducing explanation II to Section 3-D(1), it would be
appropriate to refer to Section 3 which is the taxing provision and Section 3-D(1). Section 3 reads as
follows :
Section 3. Liability to tax under the Act.-(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act,
every dealer shall, for each assessment year, pay a tax at the rates provided by or
under Section 3-A, or Section 3-D on his turnover of sales or purchases or both, as
the case may be, which shall be determined in such manner as may be prescribed.
(2) No dealer shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 18, be liable to tax under
Sub-section (1) if, during the assessment year, the aggregate of his turnover of-
(a) purchases of goods notified under Section 3-D;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 31Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
(b) purchases liable to tax under any other provision of this Act;
(c) sale of goods notified under Section 3-D where such goods have not been
purchased within the State;
(d) sales of all goods (except those notified under Section 3-D), whether such sale is
made by the dealer directly or through his branch, depot or agent inside the State, in
the course of inter-State trade or commerce or outside the State, is less than fifty
thousand rupees in the case of manufacturers and one lakh rupees, in the case of
other dealers, or such larger amount as the State Government may, by notification, in
the Gazette, specify in that behalf either in respect of all dealers in any goods or in
respect of a particular class of such dealers.
(3) ...
(4) ...
68. Section 3-D of the U. P. Sales Tax Act provides as follows :
Section 3-D. Levy of purchase or sales tax on certain goods.-(I) Except as provided in
Sub-section (2), there shall be levied and paid, for each assessment year or part
thereof, a tax on the turnover, to be determined in the prescribed manner,-
(a) of first purchases of opium, at such rate not exceeding twenty-six per cent,
(b) of first purchases of such other goods at such rate not exceeding-
(i) the maximum rate for the time being specified in Section 15 of the Central Sales
Tax Act, 1956 (Act 74 of 1956), in respect of goods declared by Section 14 of that Act
to be of special importance in inter-State trade or commerce, and
(ii) fifteen per cent in respect of other goods, and with effect from such date, as the
State Government may, by notification in the Gazette, specify in relation to purchases
made within Uttar Pradesh by a dealer (whether on his own account or on account of
any one else), or through a dealer acting as a purchasing agent :
Provided that such tax on the turnover of first purchase of mentha herb, shall be
levied and paid at the rate of seven per cent, or at such rate not exceeding fifteen per
cent as the State Government may, by notification, declare."
"Explanation II.-(1) For the purposes of this sub-section, in relation to purchases of
foodgrains in pursuance of any order made under Section 3 of the Essential
Commodities Act, 1955, including any purchase in excess of the levy share, the
purchase first made by a dealer from the State Government or its purchasing agent
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 32Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
shall be the first purchase of such food-grains and the tax shall accordingly be levied
at that point on such dealer.
(2) Where in respect of any goods notified under Sub-section (1), the purchaser
whether on his own account or on account of any one else, is a person other than a
registered dealer, there shall be levied and paid, for each assessment year or part
thereof, a tax on the turnover, to be determined in the prescribed manner, of sale of
such goods by the dealer who sells the goods or through whom the goods are sold to
such purchaser; and the rate of tax shall be the same as notified under Sub-section
(1).
(3) ...
(4) ...
(5) ...
(6) ...
(7) ...
(8) ...
69. It may be mentioned here that explanation II was added by U.P. Act No. 23 of 1976 with
retrospective effect. Under Clause (b) of Sub-section (1) of Section 3-D of the Sales Tax Act, the
liability of tax is fastened upon the first purchaser. However, in the case of purchase of foodgrains in
pursuance of any order under Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, a purchase made by
a dealer from the State Government is to be considered as first purchase of such foodgrains
including the quantity which may be purchased in excess of levy share.
70. The result of the above explanation II is that although the foodgrains are actually first purchased
by the procuring agencies or the State under the Levy Orders issued under Section 3 of the Essential
Commodities Act from the growers, farmers, millers or stockists and so on but for the purposes of
Section 3-D when such .foodgrain is purchased by a dealer from the State Government, that
purchase is taken to be the first purchase. There is no dispute about the fact that after the levy
foodgrains are procured by the State through its agencies, the same are then purchased by the Food
Corporation of India which is also registered as a dealer under the U. P. Sales Tax Act. The liability is
thus fastened upon the petitioner by virtue of explanation II to Section 3-D(1) of the U. P. Sales Tax
Act quoted above.
71. The validity of explanation II has been challenged on the ground that it is discriminatory and
unreasonable. It has been submitted that why a commodity, namely, the foodgrains, procured under
the Levy Orders in particular has been selected for explanation II. It has then been submitted that
the foodgrains procured beyond the levy share, in any case, have been unreasonably included in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 33Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
provision as that is like any other sale by the Government to another person. It has been submitted
that the explanation II has been added only with a purpose to tax the Food Corporation of India,
inasmuch as there is no other agency which might be purchasing from the State the foodgrains
procured in pursuance of Section 3 of the Essential Commodities Act. It has also been submitted
that the foodgrains procured by other agencies when sold to the Food Corporation of India, the Food
Corporation of India cannot be taxed as first purchaser. Liability of tax of other agencies cannot be
passed on to the Food Corporation of India.
72. So far procuring agencies are concerned, there is no doubt about the fact that the State procures
foodgrains under the Levy Orders through different agencies, namely, Provincial Co-operative
Federation, Essential Commodities Corporation, Agro Industrial Corporation and in certain areas
through the Food Corporation of India. These are the agencies employed for the purposes of
procuring the levy foodgrains. Such foodgrains which are procured under the Orders issued under
the Essential Commodities Act, cannot be said to be belonging to the procuring agencies. Such
foodgrains necessarily belong to the State. The petitioner could not show or establish that there is
any other dealer who might be making purchases of such levy foodgrains from the State
Government but has been exempted from the purchase tax. Therefore, we do not find any force in
the submission made on behalf of the petitioner that there is any discrimination.
73. We also cannot hold that explanation II was added only with a view to single out the petitioner
for taxation. In para 13 of the counter-affidavit, filed on behalf of the opposite parties, it has been
averred that in the year 1981-82, the Food Commissioner of U. P. had sold levy rice to the Essential
Commodities Corporation, U. P. and for that the said corporation was assessed to purchase tax
under Section 3-D(1), explanation II of the Sales Tax Act. This is an example which clearly shows
that the Food Corporation of India is not the only dealer who alone could purchase from the State
Government, other dealers may also purchase from the State Government. The assertion of singling
out of the petitioner is thus not made out. Therefore, the question of discrimination does not arise.
74. The other ground of attack is, as to why a particular commodity, viz., the foodgrain, procured
under the Levy Orders under the Essential Commodities Act, has been chosen for the purposes of
first purchase under explanation II and why not other commodities have been chosen, e.g., non-levy
foodgrains and foodgrains procured under the price support scheme, etc. The argument is that the
levy foodgrain is meant for those people who are economically not very well-off and it is distributed
through the Food Corporation of India who is being burdened with tax as first purchaser. The
burden of tax should not fall upon such persons. On the other hand, the non-levy foodgrains as well
as the foodgrains purchased under the price support scheme have not been included in explanation
II. According to the petitioner, the only idea in adding explanation II was to tax the petitioner who
would alone be covered under the provision. It may not be possible for us to hold so. There is
nothing to indicate that the addition of explanation II was aimed against the petitioner. We have
already seen as an example that the U. P. Essential Commodities Corporation was also assessed to
purchase tax when the State Government had sold such foodgrains to it. A reference has also been
made to annexure-6 accompanying the rejoinder affidavit dated 12th May, 1986 sworn by Sri S. R.
Singh which shows that the State Government sells or may in certain circumstances sell levy
foodgrains to dealers other than the Food Corporation of India. From the said annexure-6 it
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 34Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
transpires that the Food Corporation of India had not been able to lift the levy rice due to difficulties
in storing it. Therefore, the State Government had decided to sell it to the other agencies and
preference was given to the U. P. Co-operative Federation, U. P. State Food and Essential
Commodities Corporation and Consumer Co-operative Federation. The price of different qualities of
rice was also indicated. It was also indicated that the prices fixed included the amount of sales tax.
Annexure-6 belies the contention of the petitioner that there is no other agency except the Food
Corporation of India which purchases or may alone purchase levy foodgrains from the State. We
find that according to annexure-6 the amount of tax was also sought to be realised from the
purchasers by including the same in the prices fixed.
75. So far the other argument is concerned, viz., by taxing first purchaser under explanation II the
consumers of levy foodgrains will be affected, we think the argument is fallacious. Explanation II
only provides for point of taxation. It does not create fresh liability. It only indicates who and at
what point is to be taxed. If the purchase of levy foodgrains is taxed at any earlier point, then too,
the burden will ultimately pass on to the consumers alone. We, therefore, find no force in this
contention too. Non-levy foodgrain or other commodities do not get any exemption from taxation
because of explanation II.
76. Learned counsel for the opposite parties has also placed reliance upon the case reported in
[1963] 1 SCR 404 (East India Tobacco Company v. State of Andhra Pradesh). It has been observed
by the Honourable Supreme Court that the State has wide discretion in selecting a person or objects
it would tax and the taxing statute will not be open to attack on the mere ground that it taxes some
person or objects and not others, but when within the range of its selection, the law operates
unequally then certainly Article 14 of the Constitution may be said to be violated. Nothing has been
shown to indicate that any discrimination has been made between one purchaser and the other in
regard to purchases of levy foodgrains made from the State Government. Reliance has also been
placed upon a case reported in (1973) 1 SCC 216 (Hira Lal Rattan Lal v. Sales Tax Officer). In that
case the then newly added explanation II to Section 3-D(1) of the U. P. Sales Tax Act by the
amendment and validation clause were under challenge. By adding explanation II, processed or split
pulses were again made liable for tax as different item from unsplit and unprocessed foodgrains.
They were made liable to tax in respect of first purchase of split or processed foodgrains even though
tax may have been imposed in respect of their first purchases in their unsplit or unprocessed form.
The amendment was retrospective. The validation clause validated earlier notifications and
transactions, etc., notwithstanding any judgment, decree or order of any court and so the challenge
was made on different grounds. The Honourable Supreme Court while turning down the plea of the
assessees to hold the provision invalid, observed thus in para 19 :
19. It must be noticed that generally speaking the primary purpose of the levy of all
taxes is to raise funds for public good. Which person should be taxed, what
transactions should be taxed or what goods should be taxed, depends upon social,
economic and the administrative considerations. In a democratic set up it is for the
legislature to decide what economic or social policy it should pursue or what
administrative considerations it should bear in mind. The classification between the
processed or split pulses and unprocessed or unsplit pulses is a reasonable
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 35Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
classification. It is based on the use to which those goods can be put. Hence, in our
opinion, the impugned classification is not violative of Article 14.
77. It is a matter of policy for the State to take a decision as to which commodity is to be taxed, at
what point it is to be taxed and who is to be taxed. We, therefore, find no force in the submission
made on behalf of the petitioner to hold that addition of explanation II to Section 3-D(1) is
discriminatory or unconstitutional.
78. The validity of Section 3-F has also been challenged. It may be pointed out that Section 3-F was
also added by means of the same amending Act, namely, Act No. 23 of 1976, by which explanation II
to Section 3-D(1) was added. Section 3-F was given retrospective effect with effect from 1st April,
1975. Section 3-F provides for additional tax and reads as follows :
Provided that in the case of foodgrains, the rate of additional tax payable by any
dealer, the aggregate of whose turnover or turnover of purchases or both, as the case
may be, liable to tax, exceeds rupees ten crores in an assessment year, shall be five
per cent.
79. The validity of this provision has been challenged on the ground that the amendment was aimed
against the Food Corporation of India alone. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner,
there were no other dealers dealing in foodgrains except the Food Corporation of India, whose
turnover exceeds rupees ten crores. It has further been submitted that the State Government
considers the Food Corporation of India as milching cow and it was for that purpose that two
provisions were added by Act No. 23 of 1976, namely, explanation II to Section 3-D(1) and Section
3-F of the Sales Tax Act. It has been submitted that a reading of these provisions together would
leave no room for doubt that the amendments have been made only with a view to single out the
petitioner. While dealing with this point in the context with explanation II to Section 3-D(1) we have
already found that the above contention raised on behalf of the petitioner is not sustainable, rather
the indications are otherwise, namely, it could not be said that the petitioner was singled out for the
purposes of tax as first purchaser of levy foodgrains.
80. It has been submitted that certain goods can be declared as goods of special importance under
Section 14 of the Central Sales Tax Act. The result of declaration of goods of special importance
under Section 14 of the Central Sales Tax Act is that the tax on such declared goods could not exceed
four per cent of the turnover and it could only be a single point taxation. According to the learned
counsel for the petitioner, it had come to the knowledge of the State of U. P. in January, 1976 itself
that the cereals were going to be declared as goods of special importance. Therefore, hastily the
State of U. P. amended the U. P. Sales Tax Act by means of U. P. Act No. 23 of 1976 with effect from
20th May, 1976 by adding explanation II to Section 3-D(1) and Section 3-F. So far Section 3-F is
concerned, it was given retrospective effect with effect from 1st April, 1975. Cereals were declared as
goods of special importance with effect from 7th September, 1976, that is to say a few months after
U. P. Act No. 23 of 1976 came into force. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, all this
was done knowingly as the State of U. P. very well knew that it would not be possible to levy high
rate of additional tax after the goods in question were declared to be goods of special importance. It
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 36Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
may be pointed out that Section 3-F was deleted subsequently in 1981. So the relevant period so far
additional tax under Section 3-F is concerned is from 1st April, 1975 to 7th September, 1976, i.e.,
until the items in question were declared as goods of special importance. It has been submitted that
the talks had taken place between the State of U. P. and the Food Corporation of India and an
understanding was arrived at that the provisions under challenge would be deleted with
retrospective effect but that has not been done. Whatever may be the position, that would not take
us any further in deciding the question whether the amendments by adding the said provisions were
valid or not. The contention raised on behalf of the petitioner is that the addition to Section 3-F of
the Sales Tax Act was not fair and no such legislation should have been passed when it was within
the knowledge of U. P. Government that the goods in question were going to be declared as goods of
special importance. According to the learned counsel, the intention of the State was to tax the
maximum amount from the Food Corporation of India. In reply to the said submission, the learned
counsel for the opposite parties has submitted that no such plea of mala fide is permissible so far it
relates to the field of legislation. He has on this point placed reliance upon a case reported in AIR
1985 SC 551 (K. Nagaraj v. State of Andhra Pradesh). We are, therefore, of the view that no motive
could be imputed in adding Section 3-F by amending Act No. 23 of 1976.
81. So far the question of retrospective amendment is concerned, learned counsel for the opposite
parties has placed reliance upon the following cases:
AIR 1954 SC 158 (Union of India v. Madan Gopal Kabra), AIR 1961 SC 1534 (J.K. Jute
Mills Co. ltd. v. State of Uttar Pradesh), AIR 1964 SC 1581 (Epari C. Krishna Moorthy
v. State of Orissa), AIR 1973 SC 1034 (Hira Lal Rattan Lal v. Sales Tax Officer,
Kanpur).
82. On the basis of the above decisions it has been submitted that the legislature is quite competent
to impose tax with retrospective effect. Nothing has been shown to us on the basis of which it could
be said that the newly added provisions, namely, explanation II to Section 3-D(1) and Section 3-F,
could not be given retrospective effect. Reliance has also been placed upon AIR 1976 SC 489
(District Controller of Stores v. Assistant Commercial Taxation Officer). In that case, the definition
of the word "business" was changed with retrospective effect. The change was upheld by the
Honourable Supreme Court. In view of the decisions of the Supreme Court cited above, we find no
merit in the submission of the petitioner.
83. The next contention raised on behalf of the petitioner is that imposition of additional tax at the
rate of 5 per cent under Section 3-F is bad as it is confiscatory in nature and arbitrary as there is no
slab system but it is a flat rate tax which cannot be upheld. In connection with the submission that
the additional tax imposed under Section 3-F of the Sales Tax Act is confiscatory, reliance has been
placed on behalf of the petitioner upon a case reported in AIR 1983 SC 1019 (Hoechst
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. State of Bihar). In that case it was provided under the impugned provision
that those who had gross turnover of Rs. 5 lacs or more in a year, shall be liable to pay a surcharge at
the rate of 10 per cent of the tax payable by them. The provision in question was challenged on
several grounds. However, the grounds raised were negatived by the Honourable Supreme Court
and the imposition of surcharge was upheld. It was held that it was within the legislative
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 37Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
competence of the State to classify the dealers and to impose surcharge upon those who were placed
in one category taking into consideration their economic superiority. On the other pleas raised, it
was held that the imposition of surcharge would not be bad on the ground that it could not be
collected from the consumers, nor it was held to be a tax on income. It was held to be a matter of
policy of the State. It was held that such a classification on the basis of gross turnover was
reasonable. However, on behalf of the petitioner reliance has been placed on the observations made
by the Honourable Supreme Court in para 93 of the judgment where it has been observed that
surcharge was imposed upon those dealers who were economically superior to others. That is to say
it was imposed on those who had a capacity to bear the burden of additional tax. On the basis of the
above observation, it was submitted that one of the relevant considerations would be the capacity of
the dealer to bear the burden of additional tax. However, in the case of the petitioner it has been
submitted that the Food Corporation of India has already incurred loss in relation to levy
transactions which have been subsidised by the Central Government from time to time. It has been
submitted that higher turnover in the case of the petitioner does not indicate the economic
superiority of the petitioner nor its capacity to bear the burden of additional tax. The result of the
imposition of additional tax would be that even the capital of the petitioner would be eaten up in
payment of additional tax. That is to say, the imposition of additional tax is confiscatory in nature.
In this connection, reliance has also been placed upon a case reported in AIR 1985 SC 12 (K.M.
Mohamed Abdul Khader Firm v. State of Tamil Nadu). We are afraid it will not be possible for us to
accept the contention raised on behalf of the petitioner, firstly because no foundation on facts has
been laid in the petitions or in the affidavits filed subsequently. There is an averment in the
rejoinder affidavit dated 12th May, 1986 filed by Sri S. R. Singh on behalf of the petitioner, in para
3(b), wherein it has been stated that in any such welfare activity there is bound to be marginal profit
in some transactions and loss in others. The Union Government, therefore, gives a subsidy to the
Food Corporation of India every year, which was Rs. 1,352.68 crores in 1984-85. In our view, a mere
averment on facts as given above is not sufficient to come to the conclusion that imposition of
additional tax would result in confiscation of the property of the petitioner. Again we feel that if
there is some loss in running a business, it would not mean that taxes are not to be imposed on such
concerns. While considering the question whether a tax is confiscatory in nature, all the activities of
a business organisation as a whole have to be taken into account. The confiscatory nature of tax
cannot be judged transactionwise. Admittedly the petitioner also deals in foodgrains other than
covered under the Levy Orders, e.g., pulses, etc. The additional tax was leviable upon foodgrain
dealers in general. There may be some loss in one kind of transaction but profit in other kind of
transactions which may make up the loss and still leave some profit in the hands of the dealer or in a
particular year, there may be a set-back but the position may not be the same in subsequent years.
Thus on the basis of mere assertion made in para 3(b) of the rejoinder affidavit as quoted above, it
cannot be inferred that the imposition of additional tax was confiscatory in nature.
84. The next ground of attack is that providing a flat rate of additional tax without there being any
slab is unreasonable. The effect of imposition of additional tax, as it is, would be that whole amount
of turnover shall be liable to additional tax. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner if
slab is not placed at different levels of turnover, it would be hit by Article 14 of the Constitution
being unreasonable and a taxation discriminatory in nature. For the proposition that the taxing
statute in certain cases can be attacked on the ground of violation of Article 14 of the Constitution,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74948/ 38Food Corporation Of India vs Commissioner Of Sales Tax And Anr. on 21 May, 1987
reliance has been placed upon a case reported in AIR 1961 SC 552 (Kunnathat Thathunni Moofiil
Nair v. State of Kerala). In that case, it was held that the taxation was confiscatory in nature. It was
also held that inequality had resulted because of lack of classification for the purposes of taxation.
But we find that in the present case for the purposes of levy of surcharge, a classification has been
made and only those whose turnover is more than rupees ten crores in one assessment year, are
made liable for surcharge at the rate of 5 per cent. It cannot be said that there is absolute lack of
classification, nor it can be suggested that some more slabs should have been provided for the
purposes of taxation. It is entirely within the competence and jurisdiction of the State to have its
policy in regard to imposition of tax. Unless it is shown that the provision is such that it would result
in inequality, it cannot be struck down merely on the ground that tax can be imposed in a better
manner or in some more equitable manner. In this connection, it would be useful to refer to the
observations made by the Honourable Supreme Court in the above-noted case of Kunnathat
Thathunni Moopil Nair AIR 1961 SC 552 :
A taxing statute is not wholly immune from attack on the ground that it infringes the
equality clause in Article 14, though the courts are not concerned with the policy
underlying a taxing statute or whether a particular tax could not have been imposed
in a different way or in a way that' the court might think more just and equitable. If
the legislature has classified persons or properties into different categories which are
subjected different rates of taxation with reference to income or property, such a
classification would not be open to the attack of inequality on the ground that the
total burden resulting from such a classification is unequal. Similarly, different kinds
of property may be subjected to different rates of taxation, but so long as there is a
rational basis for the classification, Article 14 will not be in the way of such
classification resulting in unequal burdens on different classes of properties. But if
the same class of property similarly situated is subjected to an incidence of taxation,
which results in inequality, the law may be struck down as creating an inequality
amongst holders of the same kind of property.
85. In the present case, it may be noted that all those who have a a turnover of more than rupees ten
crores in an assessment year are to be taxed alike. No discrimination within the class is to be found.
We are, therefore, unable to accept the submission made on behalf of the petitioner that the
provisions of Section 3-F of the U. P. Sales Tax Act as existed during the relevant period are hit by
Article 14 of the Constitution. At the same time we also do not accept the submission made on behalf
of the opposite parties that the slab system is something foreign to sales tax as would be evident
from the judgment of the Honourable Supreme Court in the case of Mohamed Abdul Khader Firm
AIR 1985 SC 12. The concept of slab system, therefore, is not foreign to sales tax. However, we have
found that no discriminatory treatment is being meted out to the dealers belonging to one particular
category.
86. In a general way it has been submitted on behalf of the petitioner that it was against the public
interest to tax the petitioner, firstly by adding explanation II to Section 3-D(1) of the Sales Tax Act,
the petitioner has been made liable to pay tax as first purchaser although first purchasers from the
millers and farmers are the different agencies purchasing the foodgrains under the Levy Orders

which 'should have been taxed but even the liability of such procuring agencies or the State while
making the first purchase has been passed on to the petitioner as the provision is in respect of sale
and purchase of foodgrains procured under the Levy Orders. Such foodgrains are meant for
distribution through fair price shops that helps in feeding millions of poor people. Such a
commodity should not have been chosen for tax. We are afraid, it would not be possible for this
Court to hold imposition of tax upon such a commodity, namely, the foodgrains, invalid on the
ground urged on behalf of the petitioner as it is a matter of policy which is decided by the State. The
State is free to choose a commodity for tax as well as the manner and rates of tax over such
commodity.
87. In view of the discussion held above, we find no merit in the petitions and the same are
dismissed with costs. The order of interim relief is discharged.
