JUDGMENT
Desai, J.
1. An interesting question of law arises for our determination in this reference. The question is
whether the expression "registered dealer" in clause (ii) of section 8 of the Bombay Sales Tax Act,
1959 (hereinafter referred to as the "Bombay Act"), bears the meaning that is assigned to it in
sub-section (25) of section 2, which is the definition section, or whether the said expression is
capable of bearing a different meaning in view of the subject and context in which it is used in clause
(ii) of section 8 of the Act. The question arises in these circumstances :
The assessees were at all material times dealers in spirit and alcohol and were
registered as dealers under the Bombay Act. During the relevant assessment periods,
namely, 1st January, 1960, to 31st March, 1963, the assessees had purchased goods
from one Motibhai Gopalbhai Patel, who was carrying on business at Baroda and was
at the relevant time a dealer registered under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956
(hereinafter referred to as the "Central Act"). The said Motibhai Patel was, however,
not registered as a dealer under the Bombay Act. During the course of proceedings
for assessment to sales tax under the Bombay Act, the assessees claimed deduction
from their turnover in respect of resales of goods purchased by them from the said
Motibhai Patel. The claim for deduction was found on the provisions of clause (ii) of
section 8 of the Bombay Act which in substance provides that resales of goods
purchased by an assessee from a registered dealer shall be deducted from the
turnover of sales of goods on which sales tax is leviable if certain conditions are
fulfilled. The Sales Tax Officer rejected the claim of the assessees for such deduction
on the ground that the said Motibhai Patel from whom the goods were purchased was
not a registered dealer within the meaning of clause (ii) of section 8 in that he was
not a dealer registered under the Bombay Act at the relevant time. The assessees
carried the matter in appeal before the Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax but the
appeal was dismissed. The assessees thereupon preferred a second appeal before the
Gujarat Sales Tax Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as the "Tribunal"), but the
Tribunal also dismissed the appeal holding that in order to claim deduction from the
turnover of sales of goods under clause (ii) of section 8 of the Bombay Act, what was
required to be shown was that the goods were purchased by the dealer on or after the
appointed day from a "registered dealer" and in view of the definition of the said
expression as contained in sub-section (25) of section 2 of the Bombay Act, such
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978380/ 1Union Medical Agency vs The State Of Gujarat on 16 November, 1970
registered dealer must of necessity be a dealer registered under the Bombay Act. The
Tribunal held that since the said Motibhai Patel from whom the assessees had
purchased the goods in question was not a dealer registered under the Bombay Act,
the requirements of clause (ii) of section 8 of the Bombay Act were not satisfied and
the claim for deduction made by the assessees was not justified.
The assessees thereupon made an application under section 61 of the Bombay Act
requiring the Tribunal to refer to this court the question of law arising out of its
order. The Tribunal acceded to the request of the assessees and has stated a case in
respect of the following question of law :
"Whether for the purpose of allowing deduction from the turnover of sales under
clause (ii) of section 8 of the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1959, purchases of goods made
by a dealer registered under the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1959, from a dealer registered
under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, but not registered under the Bombay Sales Tax
Act, 1959, can be said to be purchases of goods made from the registered dealer
within the meaning of clause (ii) of section 8 of the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1959 ?"
It may be mentioned at this stage that Mr. S. L. Modi, the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of
the assessees, had submitted in the forefront of his arguments that the question as framed did not
bring out the real question of law which arises out of the order of the Tribunal. The submission was
that the question should have been so framed as to confine itself to purchases of goods from a dealer
registered under the Central Act who, by virtue of section 4 of the Bombay Act, was liable to pay tax
on the sales of those goods to the dealer registered under the Bombay Act. We find that there is
justification in the grievance made by Mr. Modi and we have accordingly reframed the question in
the following terms :
"Whether for the purpose of allowing deduction from the turnover of sales under
clause (ii) of section 8 of the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1959, purchases of goods made
by a dealer registered under the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1959, from a dealer who is
registered under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, and who is liable to pay tax under
section 4 of the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1959, though not registered under the Bombay
Sales Tax Act, 1959, can be said to be purchases of goods made from a registered
dealer within the meaning of clause (ii) of section 8 of the Bombay Sales Tax Act,
1959 ?"
The question which arises for our decision turns upon the true construction of clause (ii) of section 8
of the Bombay Act in the light of the definition of the expression "registered dealer" found in
sub-section (25) of section 2 of the said Act. In order to appreciate the rival contentions which were
strenuously urged before us, it would be necessary first to refer to the relevant provisions of the
Central Act as well as of the Bombay Act. We shall first turn to the Central Act and briefly refer to
the relevant provisions of the said Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978380/ 2Union Medical Agency vs The State Of Gujarat on 16 November, 1970
2. The Central Act was enacted to formulate principles for determining as to when a sale or purchase
of goods takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce or outside a State or in the
course of import into or export from India, to provide for the levy, collection and distribution of
taxes on sales of goods in the course of inter-State trade or commerce and to declare certain goods to
be of special importance in inter-State trade or commerce and specify the restrictions and
conditions to which State laws imposing taxes on the sale or purchase of such goods of special
importance shall be subject. Clause (b) of section 2 of the Central Act defines the expression "dealer"
to mean "any person who carries on the business of buying or selling goods, and includes a
Government which carries on such business". "Registered dealer" is defined in clause (f) to mean "a
dealer who is registered under section 7". We shall presently refer to section 7. However, before we
do so, it would be convenient to refer to section 6, which reads as under :
"6. (1) Subject to the other provisions contained in this Act, every dealer shall, with
effect from such date as the Central Government may, by notification in the official
Gazette appoint, not being earlier than thirty days from the date of such notification,
be liable to pay tax under this Act on all sales effected by him in the course of
inter-State trade or commerce during any year on and from the date so notified.
(1-A) A dealer shall be liable to pay tax under this Act on a sale of any goods effected
by him in the course of inter-State trade or commerce notwithstanding that no tax
would have been leviable (whether on the seller or purchaser) under the sales tax law
of the appropriate State if that sale had taken place inside that State.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1) or subsection (1-A), where
a sale in the course of inter-State trade or commerce of goods of the description
referred to in sub-section (3) of section 8 -
(a) has occasioned the movement of such goods from one State to another; or
(b) has been effected by a transfer of documents of title to such goods during their
movement from one State to another; any subsequent sale to a registered dealer
during such movement effected by a transfer of documents of title to such goods shall
not be subject to tax under this Act :
Provided that no such subsequent sale shall be exempt from tax under this
sub-section unless the dealer effecting the sale furnishes to the prescribed authority
in the prescribed manner a certificate duly filled and signed by the registered dealer
from whom the goods were purchased, containing the prescribed particulars."
Sub-section (1) of section 7 provides that every dealer liable to pay the tax under the Central Act
shall make an application for registration under the Act to such authority in the appropriate State as
the Central Government may, by general or special order, specify, within such time as may be
prescribed for the purpose and every such application shall contain such particulars as may be
prescribed. Sub-section (2) of the said section provides that any dealer liable to pay tax under the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978380/ 3Union Medical Agency vs The State Of Gujarat on 16 November, 1970
sales tax law of the appropriate State, or where there is no such law in force in the appropriate State
or any part thereof, any dealer having a place of business in that State or part, as the case may be,
may, notwithstanding that he is not liable to pay tax under the Central Act, apply for registration
under the said Act to the authority referred to in sub-section (1) and every such application shall
contain such particulars as may be prescribed. There is an explanation to this sub-section which
says that for the purposes of the said sub-section, a dealer shall be deemed to be liable to pay tax
under the sales tax law of the appropriate State notwithstanding that under such law a sale or
purchase made by him is exempt from tax or a refund or rebate of tax is admissible in respect
thereof. We are not concerned with the rest of the sub-sections of section 7. Section 8 of the Central
Act lays down the rate structure of tax on sales in the course of inter-State trade or commerce.
Transactions of sale in the course of inter-State trade or commerce are classified by section 8 into
four broad categories, namely : (i) sales to Government falling within section 8(1)(a); (ii)
transactions falling within section 8(1)(b), that is, sales to a registered dealer other than
Government of goods referred to in sub-section (3) of section 8; (iii) transactions falling within
section 8(2)(a), that is, sales of goods which are declared under section 14 to be of special
importance in inter-State trade or commerce, and (iv) transactions falling within section 8(2)(b),
that is, sales not falling within section 8(1) in respect of goods other than declared goods. Different
rates of tax in respect of each of these four categories of transactions are prescribed by the
Parliament in section 8. So far as sales to Government are concerned, they constitute a large bulk of
sales in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. For these inter-State sales a uniform rate of tax
is fixed under section 8(1)(a). The same is the position in regard to inter-State sales falling within
section 8(1)(b), that is, inter-State sales to a registered dealer of goods described in section 8(3),
which inter alia include goods of the class or classes specified in the certificate of registration of the
registered dealer purchasing the goods as being intended for resale by him or, subject to any rules
made by the Central Government in this behalf, for use by him in the manufacture or processing of
goods for sale or in mining or in the generation or distribution of electricity or any other form of
power. There also a uniform rate of tax is prescribed. The rate of tax in respect of both these
categories of inter-State sales was originally two per cent., but since 1st July, 1956, it has been raised
to three per cent. It may be mentioned, however, that sub-section (4) of section 8 inter alia provides
that the provisions of sub-section (1) shall not apply to any sale in the course of inter-State trade or
commerce, unless the dealer selling the goods furnishes to the prescribed authority in the prescribed
manner a declaration duly filled and signed by the registered dealer to whom the goods are sold
containing the prescribed particulars in a prescribed form obtained from the prescribed authority.
The rate of tax prescribed by section 8(2)(a) for inter-State sales of declared goods is the rate
applicable to the sale or purchase of such goods inside the appropriate State. The rate applicable to
the sale or purchase of declared goods inside the appropriate State could not, however, exceed two
per cent. prior to 1st July, 1966, and, since then, three per cent. by reason of section 15 of the Central
Act. So far as transactions of sale falling within section 8(2) are concerned, the rate of tax prescribed
is 10 per cent. or the rate applicable to the sale or purchase of such goods inside the appropriate
State, whichever is higher. Sub-sections (2-A) and (5) of section 8, broadly speaking, provide that in
certain circumstances no tax shall be payable or tax shall be payable at a rate lower than that
prescribed in sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), as the case may be.

3. From the relevant provisions of the Central Act set out above, it would appear that under the said
Act every dealer is liable to pay tax on sales effected by him in the course of inter-State trade or
commerce and every such dealer is required to obtain a certificate of registration under the said Act.
It may be noted that the combined effect of sub-sections (1)(b), (3) and (4) of section 8 is that a
dealer, who in the course of inter-State trade or commerce sells to a registered dealer, other than the
Government, goods specified in the certificate of registration of the registered dealer purchasing the
goods as being intended for resale by him or for use by him in the manufacture or processing of
goods for sale is liable to pay tax at the concessional rate of 3 per cent. provided the dealer selling
the goods furnishes to the prescribed authority in the prescribed manner a declaration duly filled in
and signed by the registered dealer to whom the goods are sold containing the prescribed particulars
in a prescribed form obtained from a prescribed authority.
4. We shall now turn to the relevant provisions of the Bombay Act. Section 2 defines various
expressions used in the Act. The said section, however, is expressly made subject to the restriction
which is usually found in all definition sections. The opening part of the said section conveys that
the expressions used in the Act would bear the meaning assigned to them in the definition section
"unless the context otherwise requires". Sub-section (25) of section 2 defines the expression
"registered dealer" as meaning a dealer registered under section 22. Sub-section (1) of section 22, in
so far as it is material, provides that no dealer shall, while being liable to pay tax under section 3 or
under sub-section (6) of section 19, carry on business as a dealer, unless he possesses a valid
certificate of registration as provided by the Act. The requirement of obtaining a certificate of
registration is thus connected with the liability of a dealer to pay tax under section 3 or under
sub-section (6) of section 19. The rest of the sub-sections of section 22 provide for the manner of
registration, issue of registration certificate and amendment and cancellation thereof. Section 3
provides for incidence of tax and sub-section (1) thereof, in so far as it is material, provides that
every dealer whose turnover either of all sales or of all purchases made during the year ending on
the 31st day of March, 1959, or the year commencing on the 1st day of April, 1959, has exceeded or
exceeds the prescribed limit specified in sub-section (4) shall, until such liability ceases under
sub-section (3), be liable to pay tax under the Act on his turnover of sales and on his turnover of
purchases made, on or after the appointed day. There is a proviso to the said sub-section, which is
not material for the present case. The rest of the sub-sections of section 3 also do not require to be
referred to. Section 6 enacts that subject to the provisions of the Act and to any Rules made
thereunder, there shall be paid by every dealer, who is liable to pay tax under the Act, the tax or
taxes leviable in accordance with the provisions of Chapter II. Section 6 is followed by a group of
sections, which deal with the levy of sales tax or general sales tax, as the case may be, on turnover of
sales of different classes of goods at prescribed rates. These sections are sections 7 to 10. It is not
necessary to set out those sections in this judgment. What requires to be noted, however, is that in
each of these four sections a provision has been made to the effect that in levying the sales tax or
general sales tax, as the case may be, at the prescribed rates, certain deductions shall be made from
the turnover of sales of goods of the dealer concerned. In other words, while assessing the sales tax
or general sales tax, as the case may be, payable by the concerned dealer, sections 7 to 10
contemplate certain deductions to be made from the turnover of sales of the said dealer. We shall set
out section 8 in order to illustrate this position. Section 8, as it stood at the material time, read as
under :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978380/ 5Union Medical Agency vs The State Of Gujarat on 16 November, 1970
"8. There shall be levied a sales tax on the turnover of sales of goods specified in
Schedule C at the rate set out against each of them in column 3 thereof, but after
deducting from such turnover, -
(i) resales of goods on the purchase of which the dealer is liable to pay purchase tax
under section 13 or 14,
(ii) resales of goods purchased by him on or after the appointed day from a registered
dealer, if the goods at the time of their purchase were goods specified in Schedule C,
and,
(iii) sales of goods, or resales of goods to which clauses (i) and (ii) do not apply, to an
authorised dealer, or recognised dealer, or to a commission agent holding a permit
who purchases on behalf of a principal who is an authorised dealer or recognised
dealer, upon such dealer or commission agent, as the case may be, furnishing a
certificate as provided in section 12."
It would be seen that in levying sales tax on the turnover of sales of goods specified in Schedule C at
the rate set out against each of them in column 3 thereof, deduction from turnover is required to be
made in respect of the following categories of sales or resales of goods : (i) resales of goods on the
purchase of which the dealer is liable to pay purchase tax; (ii) resales of goods purchased by him on
or after the appointed day from a registered dealer if the goods at the time of their purchase were
goods specified in Schedule C; and (iii) sales of goods, or resales of goods, to which clauses (i) and
(ii) do not apply to an authorised dealer, or recognised dealer, or to a commission agent, provided
certain conditions are satisfied. We are, in the instant case, directly concerned with clause (ii) of
section 8 and the effect of the said provision is that if the concerned dealer, upon whom sales tax is
sought to be levied, shows that in his turnover of sales of goods are included resales of goods
purchased by him on or after the appointed day from a registered dealer, such resales would be
deducted from his total turnover provided the goods at the time of their purchase were goods
specified in Schedule C and he would be assessed to sales tax accordingly.
5. We may at this stage point out that the obvious intention of the Legislature in enacting this and
similar provisions is to restrict the levy of sales tax to a single point and to avoid multiple levy of
sales tax on goods. The intention of the Legislature is that sales tax should be levied at the stage of
first sale and should be recovered from the registered dealer who effects the first sale and all
subsequent sales of such goods should not be subjected to sales tax over again. We find that this
thread runs throughout sections 7 to 10 and the legislative intention is clearly manifested in this
group of sections which, in substance and effect, provide that the levy of sales tax should be at a
single point and that too at the point of first sale of the goods. This aspect has a direct bearing on the
question which arises for our determination in this case and will have to be borne in mind.
6. We shall now turn to another section of the Bombay Act which creates a special liability to pay tax
in the case of a dealer who might be registered under the Central Act but who is not registered under
the Bombay Act on the sales of certain goods. The relevant provision is section 4 of the Bombay Act,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978380/ 6Union Medical Agency vs The State Of Gujarat on 16 November, 1970
which reads as under :
"4. (1) Notwithstanding anything in section 3, a dealer who is registered under the
Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, but who is not liable to pay tax under the said section 3,
shall nevertheless be liable to pay tax -
(a) on sales of goods in respect of the purchase of which he has furnished a
declaration under sub-section (4) of section 8 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, and
(b) on sales of goods in the manufacture of which the goods so purchased have been
used, and accordingly, the provisions of sections 7 to 12 (both inclusive) shall apply to
such sales, as they apply to the sales made by a dealer liable to pay tax under section
3.
(2) Every dealer who is liable to pay tax under sub-section (1) shall, for the purposes
of sections 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 46, 47 and 48 be deemed to be a registered
dealer."
This section provides that a dealer registered under the Central Act, who may not be liable to pay tax
under section 3 of the Bombay Act, would nevertheless be liable to pay tax under the Bombay Act on
sales of goods in respect of the purchase of which he has furnished a declaration under sub-section
(4) of section 8 of the Central Act and on sales of goods in the manufacture of which the purchased
goods have been used. The provisions of sections 7 to 12 are made applicable to such sales in the
same manner in which they apply to the sales made by a dealer liable to pay tax under section 3 and
every dealer who is liable to pay tax under section 4 is, for the purpose of sections 32 to 38 and 46 to
48, deemed to be a registered dealer. Sections 32 to 38 and 46 to 48 make provision inter alia for
assessment, reassessment, recovery and refund of tax and imposition of penalty. The effect of these
provisions is that so far as sales referred to in section 4 are concerned, a dealer registered under the
Central Act is liable to pay tax thereon like any other dealer registered under the Bombay Act and
such dealer is deemed to be a registered dealer for certain purposes under the Bombay Act. These
are the relevant provisions of the Bombay Act, which are required to be noted for the purposes of
this Act.
7. Mr. S L. Modi, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the assessees, urged that in the present
case, the dealer from whom the assessees had purchased the goods was liable to be assessed to sales
tax under section 4 of the Bombay Act on the sales made to the assessees and in order to avoid
multiple levy of sales tax, it was necessary to give to the assessees the benefit of section 8(ii) of the
Bombay Act, although the dealer from whom the assessees purchased the goods was not a registered
dealer under the Bombay Act. The submission was that the expression "registered dealer" appearing
in clause (ii) of section 8 of the Bombay Act was required to be given a meaning different than that
which is ascribed to it in the definition section in order to carry out the intention of the Legislature
and the object of clause (ii) of section 8 of the Bombay Act. According to Mr. Modi, clause (ii) of
section 8 was obviously enacted to ensure a single point levy of sales tax when the first sale was
effected and to avoid multiple levy of sales tax when subsequent sales of such goods take place. If the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978380/ 7Union Medical Agency vs The State Of Gujarat on 16 November, 1970
expression "registered dealer" appearing in clause (ii) of section 8 were given the narrow meaning
ascribed to it in the definition section, the intention of the Legislature would be defeated in a case
like the present one where special liability to pay sales tax is created by section 4 in respect of sales
of certain kinds of goods made by a dealer registered under the Central Act. Sales of such goods
would be subjected to the levy of sales tax at least at two stages; first, when the said goods are sold
by the dealer registered under the Central Act and secondly, when the dealer registered under the
Bombay Act, who purchased the goods from such dealer, sells them again within the State. The
submission was that the definition of the expression "registered dealer" as contained in sub-section
(25) of section 2 of the Bombay Act was in terms subject to the qualification laid down in the
opening part of section 2 and that having regard to the context in which the expression "registered
dealer" is used in clause (ii) of section 8, the expression "registered dealer" should be so construed
as to include not only a dealer registered under the Bombay Act but also a dealer registered under
the Central Act who incurs special liability to pay sales tax under the provisions of section 4 of the
Bombay Act. According to Mr. Modi, such construction would be in consonance with the scheme of
the Act and instrumental in carrying out the object of the Legislature in enacting clause (ii) of
section 2 of the Bombay Act.
8. The argument put forward by Mr. Modi raises the question whether the expression "registered
dealer" appearing in section 8(ii) should be so construed as to include within its ambit not only a
dealer registered under the Bombay Act but also a dealer registered under the Central Act upon
whom a special liability to pay sales tax has been imposed by section 4 of the Bombay Act. Now, it is
true that sub-section (25) of section 2 defines the expression "registered dealer" as a dealer
registered under section 22 of the Bombay Act and further that the said definition is an exhaustive
definition. Ordinarily, therefore, the expression "registered dealer", which is used in section 8(ii),
would bear the meaning which is given to it in the definition section, namely, sub-section (25) of
section 2. However, it is well-settled that it is possible for a defined expression to have a somewhat
different meaning in different sections of the Act depending upon the subject or the context. The
point for determination is : does that rule apply in the case of the expression under consideration ?
9. We may, in this connection, first refer to the decision of the Supreme Court in V.F. & G. Insurance
Co. v. M/s. Fraser and Ross ([1960] 30 Comp. Cas. (Ins.) 13 (S.C.); A.I.R. 1960 S.C. 971). The
Supreme Court was in that case concerned with the meaning of the word "insurer" which was used
in sections 33 and 2D of the Insurance Act, 1938. The word was defined by sub-section (9) of section
2 of the said Act, inter alia, as meaning any body corporate (not being a person specified in
sub-clause (c) of the said clause), carrying on the business of insurance which is a body corporate
incorporated under any law for the time being in force in India or stands to any such body corporate
in the relation of a subsidiary company within the meaning of the Indian Companies Act. The
appellant-company in that case had closed down its business of insurance and still by virtue of the
authority conferred upon it by section 33 of the Act, the Government of India passed an order
directing the Controller of Insurance to investigate the affairs of the company and to submit a
report. The respondents were thereafter appointed to act as auditors to assist him in the
investigation. The order passed by the Government of India was challenged by the appellant
company in a writ petition inter alia on the ground that the company having closed all its insurance
business, no order could be passed against it under section 33 as that section only applied to an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978380/ 8Union Medical Agency vs The State Of Gujarat on 16 November, 1970
"insurer", that is, to a company actually carrying on the business of insurance. The writ petition was
dismissed in the first instance by a single Judge of the Madras High Court and on appeal by a
Division Bench of the same High Court. The company thereupon carried the matter in appeal to the
Supreme Court. The argument on behalf of the appellant-company before the Supreme Court was
based on the exhaustive definition of the word "insurer" in section 2(9) of the Act. The Supreme
Court, while dealing with this contention, observed as follows :
"The main basis of this contention is the definition of the word 'insurer' in section
2(9) of the Act. It is pointed out that that definition begins with the words 'insurer
means' and is therefore exhaustive. It may be accepted that generally the word
'insurer' has been defined for the purposes of the Act to mean a person or body
corporate, etc., which is actually carrying on the business of insurance, i.e., the
business of effecting contracts of insurance of whatever kind they might be. But
section 2 begins with the words 'in this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the
subject or context', and then comes the various definition clauses of which (9) is one.
It is well-settled that all the statutory definitions or abbreviations must be read
subject to the qualification variously expressed in the definition clauses which
created them and it may be that even where the definition is exhaustive inasmuch as
the word defined is said to mean a certain thing, it is possible for the word to have a
somewhat different meaning in different sections of the Act depending upon the
subject or the context. That is why all definitions in statutes generally begin with the
qualifying words similar to the words used in the present case, namely, unless there
is anything repugnant in the subject or context. Therefore, in finding out the meaning
of the word 'insurer' in various sections of the Act, the meaning to be ordinarily given
to it is that given in the definition clause. But this is not inflexible and there may be
sections in the Act where the meaning may have to be departed from on account of
the subject or context in which the word has been used and that will be giving effect
to the opening sentence in the definition section, namely, unless there is anything
repugnant in the subject or context. In view of this qualification, the court has not
only to look at the words, but also to look at the context, the collocation and the
object of such words relating to such matter and interpret the meaning intended to be
conveyed by the use of the words under the circumstances. Therefore, though
ordinarily the word 'insurer' as used in the Act would mean a person or body
corporate actually carrying on the business of insurance it may be that in certain
sections the word may have a somewhat different meaning."
Having considered the matter in the light of these principles, the Supreme Court in fact found in
that case that the word "insurer" in section 33 not only refers to a person who is actually carrying on
business, but in the context of that section and taking into account the policy of the Act and the
purposes for which the control envisaged by the Act was imposed on insurers, also refers to insurers
who were carrying on the business of insurance but have closed it.
10. In Maxwell's Interpretation of Statutes, the learned author has made the following observations
on this aspect at page 30 of the Eighth Edition :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978380/ 9Union Medical Agency vs The State Of Gujarat on 16 November, 1970
"Even where an Act contains a definition section it does not necessarily apply in all
contexts in which a defined word may be found. If a defined expression is used in a
context which the definition will not fit, the context must be allowed to prevail over
the 'artificial conceptions' of the definition clause, and the word must be given its
ordinary meaning."
In Craies on Statute Law, Sixth Edition, page 213, the learned author has dealt with this question
and relying upon the decision of Scott, L.J., in Jobbins v. Middlesex County Council ([1949] 1 K.B.
142), observed that a definition section ought to be so construed as not cutting down the enacting
provisions of an Act unless there is absolutely clear language having the opposite effect.
11. It is thus clear that though ordinarily the meaning to be given to an expression found in a
provision of a statute is one that is given in the definition clause, there may be cases in which that
meaning may have to be departed from having regard to the context, collocation and the object of
the statute and it may become necessary to interpret the word differently so as to give effect to the
enacting provision of the Act.
12. We may also in this connection refer to another rule of construction applicable to all statutes
alike, which is spoken of as exposition ex visceribus actus. In Mahomed Tayoob Daruwala v. State of
Bombay ([1960] 11 S.T.C. 612), a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court has set out the effect of
this rule of construction in the following words :
"The court is bound to see that every provision of a statute is construed with
reference to the context and the other provisions of the statute and preferably of the
same section, where it is possible to do so. The court is entitled and even bound, as
far as possible, to see that the interpretation it puts on a particular provision makes a
consistent enactment of the whole statute. In applying these rules the court has to
remember what has so often been emphasised that as far as possible nothing can be
read and nothing can be implied in a taxing statute. One can only look fairly at the
language used. The indispensable starting point and the first step in case of any
provision of the nature before us is to examine the words of the particular provision
under consideration, of course, bearing in mind that it is not a detached enactment
but one forming a connected scheme."
In Craies on Statute Law, Sixth Edition, the following observations are found at page 99, which are
also pertinent :
"This rule of construction (namely exposition ex visceribus actus) has frequently been
recognised and acted upon by courts of law from Coke's time down to the present
day. In Brett v. Brett ([1826] 3 Add. 210, 216), Sir John Nicholl, M. R., said as follows
: 'The key to the opening of every law is the reason and spirit of the law; it is the
animus imponentis, the intention of the law-maker expressed in the law itself, taken
as a whole. Hence, to arrive at the true meaning of any particular phrase in a statute,
the particular phrase is not to be viewed detached from its context in the statute; it is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978380/ 10Union Medical Agency vs The State Of Gujarat on 16 November, 1970
to be viewed in connection with its whole context, meaning by this as well the title
and preamble as the purview or enacting part of the statute.' In Bywater v. Brandling
([1828] 7 B.& C. 643, 660), Lord Tenterden said : 'In construing Acts of Parliament
we are to look not only at the language of the preamble or of any particular clause,
but at the language of the whole Act. And if we find in the preamble or in any
particular clause an expression not so large and extensive in its import as those used
in other parts of the Act, and upon a view of the whole Act we can collect from the
more large and extensive expressions used in other parts the real intention of the
Legislature, it is our duty to give effect to the larger expressions, notwithstanding the
phrases of less extensive import in the preamble or in any particular clause.'"
At page 100, the following observations from the decision of Blackburn, J., in Rein v. Lane ([1867]
L.R. 2 Q.B. 144, 151), are quoted :
"It is, I apprehend, in accordance with the general rule of construction that you are
not only to look at the words, but you are to look at the context, the collocation, and
the object of such words relating to such matter, and interpret the meaning according
to what would appear to be the meaning intended to be conveyed by the use of the
words under the circumstances."
We shall now proceed to consider the provisions of section 8 of the Bombay Act in the light of these
principles. As stated above, the legislative intention in providing for deduction in section 8 is to
avoid multiple levy of tax on sales of goods and to restrict the levy to the stage at which the first sale
takes place. Similar provisions are to be found also in sections 7, 9 and 10, which are the other
sections, which deal with the levy of tax on sales of goods specified in different schedules of the Act.
It would thus appear that the scheme of the Act is that there should be a single point levy of tax and
that too at the point of first sale. This proposition is not disputed even on behalf of the
Commissioner. If that be so then there is no reason to limit the meaning of the expression
"registered dealer" appearing in clause (ii) of section 8 only to a dealer registered under section 2 of
the Bombay Act and to exclude from the ambit of that expression a dealer registered under the
Central Act who is liable to be assessed to sales tax under section 4 of the Bombay Act. We must read
the provisions of section 4 along with the provisions of section 8 and also give effect to the intention
of the Legislature in providing for deductions in section 8. The context in which the words
"registered dealer" appear in clause (ii) of section 8 of the Act suggests that the meaning given to the
said expression in the definition section of the Bombay Act must be departed from and to do so
would only give effect to the policy of the Act and the object behind enacting the relevant provisions.
13. Mr. B. R. Shah, the learned Assistant Government Pleader, appearing on behalf of the
department strenuously urged that there was no warrant for departing from the meaning given to
the expression "registered dealer" in the definition section while construing the said expression in
the context of section 8. He contended in the first place that if the Legislature really intended that
the expression "registered dealer" in section 8(ii) should take within its ambit a dealer registered
under the Central Act upon whom liability to pay sales tax is imposed under section 4 of the Bombay
Act, the Legislature would have said so in clear words and it would have made the necessary
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978380/ 11Union Medical Agency vs The State Of Gujarat on 16 November, 1970
provision in sub-section (2) of section 4 of the Bombay Act, which provides that every dealer liable
to pay tax under sub-section (1) shall be deemed to be a registered dealer for the purposes of certain
sections of the Bombay Act. The argument in other words was that it would have been specifically
enacted in sub-section (2) of section 4 that every such dealer shall be deemed to be a registered
dealer also for the purposes of clause (ii) of section 8 of the Bombay Act. We find that this
submission, attractive though it may appear at first sight, is fallacious. As observed earlier,
sub-section (1) of section 4 is enacted with the specific object of imposing upon a dealer registered
under the Central Act liability to pay sales tax under the Bombay Act on sales of goods specified
therein at designated rates. Having thus provided for the charge of tax and the rate structure, the
Legislature has proceeded to lay down in sub-section (2) of section 4 the machinery for assessment,
reassessment, collection and enforcement of payment of tax and penalty as well as for other
incidental and connected matters. The Legislature has achieved this object by creating a fiction in
sub-section (2) of section 4 as a result of which the relevant sections of the Bombay Act, which
provide the machinery for assessment, reassessment and recovery of tax imposed by section 3 on a
dealer registered under the said Act, become applicable proprio vigore to a dealer registered under
the Central Act upon whom liability to pay tax is imposed by section 4. It is apparent that the fiction
in sub-section (2) is created for this limited purpose, namely, to make section 4 a self-contained
code which not only imposes the charge of tax and lays down the rate structure but also provides a
machinery for the assessment and recovery of tax and other allied matters. It would, therefore, have
been inappropriate or at any rate wholly inartistic for the Legislature to provide in sub-section (2) of
section 4 that every dealer who is liable to pay tax under sub-section (1) shall be deemed to be a
registered dealer for the purpose of clause (ii) of section 8 since the latter section provides for the
levy of sales tax on sales of goods of an altogether different dealer after making certain deductions
from the turnover of sales of goods of such dealer. The Legislature could have made a specific
provision, if any, in this behalf only in clause (ii) of section 8 and not in sub-section (2) of section 4.
14. Mr. Shah next contended that the effect of giving to the expression "registered dealer" in clause
(ii) of section 8 a meaning different from that found in the definition section would in fact be to
extend the legal fiction created by sub-section (2) of section 4 beyond its legitimate field. Mr. Shah
urged that when a legal fiction is created it should be confined to the purpose for which it was
created and should not be extended to an altogether different or alien field. The argument, in our
opinion, is wholly misconceived. The expression "registered dealer" in clause (ii) of section 8 is
construed as taking within its ambit a dealer registered under the Central Act who is made liable to
pay sales tax under section 4 of the Bombay Act not on account of the legal fiction created by
sub-section (2) of section 4 of the Bombay Act, but having regard to the context, collocation, object
and policy of the Act. The legal fiction created by sub-section (2) of section 4 does not at all enter
into consideration in giving an extended or different meaning to the expression "registered dealer"
in section 8(ii).
15. Mr. Shah then advanced an argument founded on provisions of sub-section (3) of section 7 of the
Bombay Act. Section 7 deals with single point levy of sales tax or general sales tax on declared goods
and sub-section (3) thereof reads as under :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978380/ 12Union Medical Agency vs The State Of Gujarat on 16 November, 1970
"(3) In order to ensure that after the date of the coming into force of section 15 of the
Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, tax shall not be levied on the sales or purchases of
declared goods at more than one stage, it is hereby provided that if under this Act, or
any earlier law, any tax has been levied or is leviable on the sale or purchase of such
goods, then no further tax shall be levied under this Act on any subsequent sale or
purchase thereof; and accordingly, for the purpose of arriving at the taxable turnover
of sales or purchases of a dealer, there shall be deducted from his total turnover of
sales, or as the case may be, of purchases, the sales or purchases of such declared
goods as have borne tax at any earlier stage."
Mr. Shah urged that the provisions of sub-section (3) of section 7 would show that whenever it was
intended that there should be a single point of levy of tax, the Legislature has made a specific
provision to that effect in the Act. Therefore, if the Legislature had intended that no further tax
should be levied under the Act on subsequent sales of goods, which might already have been subject
to sales tax under the provisions of section 4 of the Act at the stage of previous sale, the Legislature
would have made a clear provision to that effect in section 4 or section 8 on the lines of the
provisions contained in sub-section (3) of section 7.
16. We find that this argument of Mr. Shah is also devoid of any merit. Sub-sections (1) and (2) of
section 7 provide for the levy of tax on sales of declared goods. In these two sub-sections, provision
is already made for deductions from the turnover of sales of the concerned dealer of declared goods
in order to avoid multiple levy of tax. Sub-section (3) of section 7 is, however, specifically enacted to
carry out the mandate of section 15 of the Central Act which contains an injunction that the tax
payable under the sales tax law of a State on the sale or purchase of declared goods within the State
shall not be levied at more than one stage. It would appear from the language used in sub-section (3)
of section 7 of the Bombay Act that it is enacted to ensure that after the date of coming into force of
section 15 of the Central Act, the mandate contained in the said section is in no case violated and if
any tax has been levied or is leviable on the sale or purchase of declared goods either under the
provisions of the Bombay Act (1959) or under any earlier sales tax law of the State, no further tax
shall be levied on any subsequent sale or purchase of such goods. This provision was obviously
enacted to meet a special situation, namely, to give complete effect to the provisions of section 15 of
the Central Act and to ensure that there is no multiple levy of tax even in cases inadvertently left but
or not specifically covered by the provisions of sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 7, so that there is
no conflict with section 15 of the Central Act. Sub-section (3) of section 7 cannot, therefore, help us
in construing clause (ii) of section 8 of the Bombay Act.
17. Mr. Shah next contended that the legislative history clearly indicated that the Legislature did not
intend to exempt from the levy of tax subsequent sales of goods, which might have borne the levy of
tax at the stage of earlier sale under section 4 of the Act. In this connection, Mr. Shah invited our
attention to the provisions of section 5A of the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1953, which read as under :
"5A. (1) A dealer registered under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, who is not liable to
pay tax under section 5 of this Act, shall nevertheless be liable to pay tax on his sale of
any goods in respect of the purchase of which he has furnished a declaration under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978380/ 13Union Medical Agency vs The State Of Gujarat on 16 November, 1970
sub-section (4) of section 8 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, or on the sale of any
goods in the manufacture of which such goods have been used, at a rate equal to the
aggregate of the rates specified in columns 2 and 3 of Schedule B or, as the case may
be, at the rate specified under section 7A :
Provided that the tax under this section shall not be payable if the seller shows to the
satisfaction of the Collector that the purchaser of the goods is a dealer registered
under this Act and has furnished to such seller a certificate in the prescribed form
declaring inter alia that the goods so sold to him are intended for resale by him or for
use by him, in the prescribed manner, in the manufacture or processing of any goods
for sale.
(2) Every dealer who is liable to pay tax under sub-section (1) shall, for the purposes
of sections 13, 14, 16, 21 and 22, be deemed to be a registered dealer."
Mr. Shah contended that the provisions of section 5A of the Bombay Act of 1953 are substantially in
pari materia with the provisions of section 4 of the Bombay Act, 1959, in that both these provisions
created a special liability in respect of a dealer registered under the Central Act to pay tax on sales of
goods of specific kind under the sales tax law of the State. However, the 1933 Act enacted a specific
proviso to section 5A, which provided that the dealer under the Central Act will not be liable to pay
sales tax under section 5A if the dealer showed to the satisfaction of the Collector that the purchaser
of the goods was a dealer registered under the Bombay Act and had furnished to the seller a
certificate in the prescribed form declaring inter alia that the goods sold to him were intended for
resale by him or for use by him in the manufacture or processing of any goods for sale, as the case
may be. Mr. Shah drew our attention to the fact that such a proviso was not enacted in section 4 of
the Act of 1959 nor was a similar provision made in section 8 of the said Act and that having regard
to this conscious omission on the part of the Legislature, we should proceed on an assumption that
the Legislature did not intend that no tax shall be levied on subsequent sales of goods which might
have been subject to levy of sales tax under the provisions of section 5 at the stage of earlier sale. The
submission made by Mr. Shah cannot be accepted for two reasons. In the first instance, mere
omission in a later statute of a provision contained in an earlier one cannot by itself be said to be an
indication of the legislative intent. The Legislature may have omitted to make a similar provision in
the later Act if it found it unnecessary to make such a provision having regard to the other
provisions of the Act which might bring about the same effect or it may have made the relevant
provision in the earlier Act ex abundanti cautela. The circumstance that in a later Act a provision
which found place in an earlier Act has been deleted cannot, therefore, by itself and conclusively
determine the question. Secondly, we find that the scheme of the Act of 1953 is materially different
from the scheme of the Act of 1959. Section 5A of the 1953 Act contemplated the levy of a single
point tax at the stage when the second sale takes place, viz., the stage at which a dealer registered
under the Bombay Act effects the sale. Under the 1959 Act, the scheme has been altered and the
sales tax is now sought to be levied under section 4 on sales of certain class or classes of goods at the
stage when the first sale takes place. Having regard to this change in the scheme of the Act, it is not
unreasonable to assume that the Legislature did not find it necessary to enact in section 4 a proviso
similar to that found in section 5A of the Act since the object of single point levy of sales tax was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/978380/ 14Union Medical Agency vs The State Of Gujarat on 16 November, 1970
achieved by providing for suitable deductions from the turnover of sales of goods in clause (ii) of
section 8 of the Act.
18. Mr. Shah lastly urged that if the expression "registered dealer" appearing in clause (ii) of section
8 were to be interpreted to include a dealer registered under the Central Act on whom a special
liability to pay sales tax has been imposed by section 4, the object of enacting section 4 itself would
be frustrated. Mr. Shah elaborated his submission by illustrating the point in this manner : suppose
the dealer registered under the Central Act sells to a dealer liable to pay sales tax under section 8 of
the Act not only these goods upon the sale of which sales tax has been assessed under the provisions
of section 4 of the Act, but also other goods upon the sale of which he was not to be liable to pay
sales tax under the Bombay Act. In such a case, the dealer registered under the Bombay Act would
be able to claim deduction from his total turnover of sales of goods not only in respect of the goods
on the sale of which the dealer under the Central Act has paid sales tax under section 4 but also in
respect of resales of other goods on the sale of which no liability is imposed upon the dealer
registered under the Central Act to pay sales tax under the Bombay Act. The argument in other
words was that the effect of construing the expression "registered dealer" in section 8(ii) to mean
and include a dealer registered under the Central Act would be to leave doors open for evasion of tax
on certain class or classes of goods sold by a dealer registered under the Central Act to a dealer
registered under the Bombay Act. The submission, in our opinion, is misconceived. Even if the
expression "registered dealer" in clause (ii) of section 8 is given a wider meaning for which the
assessees contend, it would only include a dealer registered under the Central Act who is liable to
pay tax on the sales of goods under section 4 and the deduction under clause (ii) of section 8 would
be allowable only if the goods resold are goods on the sale of which the dealer registered under the
Central Act is liable to pay tax under section 4 of the Act. If the dealer registered under the Central
Act has sold to the dealer registered under the Bombay Act goods other than those specified in
section 4 of the Bombay Act and such goods have been later resold by the dealer registered under
the Bombay Act, no deduction from turnover of sales would be permissible in respect of resales of
such goods and such sales would be includible in the total turnover of sales of the dealer registered
under the Bombay Act. The apprehension voiced on behalf of the department is, therefore,
misconceived.
19. The result of the foregoing discussion is that having regard to the context, collocation and the
object of the expression "registered dealer" in clause (ii) of section 8 of the Bombay Act and having
regard to the policy of the Act, the said expression would also include a dealer registered under the
Central Act on whom special liability to pay sales tax has been imposed under section 4 of the Act. A
dealer who purchases goods from a dealer registered under the Central Act, who is liable to pay sales
tax on the sale of the said goods by virtue of the provisions of section 4 of the Bombay Act, would,
therefore, be entitled to deduct from his turnover of sales of goods, resales of goods so purchased by
him on or after the appointed day if the goods, at the time of their purchase, were goods specified in
Schedule C.
20. Our answer to the question as reframed by us is, therefore, in the affirmative. The reference is
disposed of accordingly. The department to pay to the assessees the costs of this reference.
