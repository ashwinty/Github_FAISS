Brief facts:
2. Briefly the facts as stated in the petition are that the petitioner had floated tender No. J
12015/5/2011−Pur -III dated 19.12.2011 for procurement of 1125 MT Gram Whole. The respondent
participated in the tender and accepted the terms & conditions of the tender. The contract AT No. J−
13015/2/41/2012/P.III dated 09.02.2012 was awarded to the respondent for supply of Gram Whole
at Rs. 3553/− per quintal. As per the contract, the delivery period was from 16.02.2012 to
29.02.20125. The respondent furnished an unconditional bank guarantee of Rs. 39,97,125/− in
terms of clause 7 (4) of the appendix to the tender and revised DGS & D 68, which could be forfeited
in case of any breach of contract.

3. It is stated that the respondent vide its letter dated 21.02.2012 sought the extension of delivery
period upto 31.03.2012 without any liquidated damages, which request was accepted and the
delivery period was extended upto 31.03.2012 vide letter dated 27.02.2012. It is stated that when the
respondent failed to supply the contracted quantity by 31.03.2012, it was issued performance notice
dated 12.04.2012 to complete the supply by 14.05.2012 but it failed to supply the material within the
extended time, which led to the cancellation of contract vide letter dated 29.06.2012 in terms of
clause 8 (ii) of the appendix to the tender inquiry and clause 14 (7)
(iii) of revised DGS & D 68.
It is alleged that since, the respondent failed to supply the OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs.
Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.2 of 45 contracted quantity of Gram Whole, it
committed the breach of contract and the bank guarantee was forfeited in terms of clause 18
(d) (viii) of the appendix to tender inquiry and clause 7 (4) of the revised DGS & D 68 and was
deposited in the Treasury on 16.07.2012. Rs. 29,97,844/− were retained as general damages and Rs.
9,99,281/− were returned to the respondent. The respondent invoked the Arbitration Process and
filed its claim, which was responded by the petitioner bringing the true facts as well as the legal
position. The Arbitrator passed the impugned award.
4. The Arbitrator while deciding issue no. 3 i.e. whether the petitioner was justified in deducting the
amount of Rs. 29,97,844/− as damages while refunding some amount to the respondent and issue
no. 2 i.e. whether the respondent is entitled to refund of the entire amount of the bank guarantee,
which was encashed by the petitioner, did not find merit in the arguments of the respondent that the
performance was virtually impossible, Gram Whole was not available in the whole sale mandis and
it was all more difficult to procure the item from whole sale mandis without the involvement of any
middlemen. It was held that the respondent being the old vendor should have known before
submitting the tender whether Gram Whole was available or not in whole sale mandis, it should also
have been aware of the circumstances and conditions prevailing in the market and now it cannot
escape liability by taking refuge behind the alleged non−availability and restrictive terms. Section 56
of the Indian Contract Act was referred and it was held that plea of non− OMP Comm No.42/19
Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.3 of 45 availability appears to
be false. It was observed that Gram Whole is harvested in March / April and CW1 himself has
admitted that harvesting season of Gram Whole is April, so it must have been available in penalty in
the month of April. The legality of performance notice as pleaded by the respondent was also
considered, break clause was discussed and the Arbitrator did not find force in the arguments of the
respondent that 30 days clear time for performance was not given vide notice dated 12.04.2012 and
the contract could not have been cancelled on its basis. It was held that break clause simply means
that contractor should be given 30 days for performance before cancelling the contract. In this case,
the notice was given on 12.04.2012 and the contract was cancelled on 29.06.2012 (wrongly typed as
04.08.2012), which was more than 30 days after the notice. Thus, ample opportunity for
performance was given in accordance with break clause before the cancellation of contract. It was
held that there was nothing unlawful for the petitioner invoking the bank guarantee and converting
it into cash.

Question then arose whether the petitioner was right in cancelling the contract or encashing the
bank guarantee or whether the petitioner could have claimed 75% of the bank guarantee amount as
general damages. Clause 18 (d) (viii) of clause 8 (v) of the appendix to the contract Ex. RW1/A and
Para 7 (4) of revised DGS & D 68 were discussed and it was held that all these clauses are in the
nature of stipulation by way of penalty. The case of Maula Bax Vs. Union of India, 1970 (1) SCR 928
was referred, wherein, it was held that where under the terms / contracts, the party in breach has
OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.4 of 45
undertaken to pay a sum of money or to forfeit a sum of money, which he has already paid to the
party complaining of breach of contract, the undertaking is of the nature of penalty and it was
observed that all stipulations by way of penalty are covered by Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act.
The case of Fateh Chand Vs. Bal Kishan 1964 (1) SCR 515 was also referred, wherein, it was held that
Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act undoubtedly says that the aggrieved party is entitled to receive
compensation from the party, who has broken the contract, whether or not actual damages or loss is
proved to have been caused by the breach. It merely dispenses with the proof of actual loss or
damages. It does not justify the award of compensation, when in consequence of breach, no legal
injury at all has resulted because compensation for breach of contract can be awarded to make good
loss or damages, which naturally arises in the usual course of things. Case of Kailash Nath Vs. DDA,
2015 (4) SCC 136 was also referred.
5. The contentions of Ld. Counsel for the parties were considered including the decision in the case
of ONGC Vs. Saw Pipes Limited, Civil Appeal No. 7419 of 2001 and it was observed that in the
ONGC case supra, entire amount of security furnished by the contractor was allowed to be forfeited,
parties had expressly agreed that the amount was a genuine pre−estimate of damages and the
liquidated damages were not by way of penalty but present is a case where stipulation by way of
penalty was made. In the case ONGC supra, it was held that it is the primary duty of the Arbitrator
OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.5 of 45
to enforce the terms, which the parties have made and to uphold the sanctity of the contract, which
forms the basis of the civil societies and also the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator.
6. It was observed that the Arbitrator is supposed to protect the promisee by awarding proper
compensation in appropriate cases and at the same time, to protect the interest of the promiser by
granting him relief against any unlawful forfeiture and recovery. In Fateh Chand case supra, the
Supreme Court has held that the jurisdiction of the Court to award compensation in cases of breach
of contract is unqualified except to the maximum stipulated but the compensation has to be
reasonable. In the case of Maula Bax supra, the Supreme Court acknowledged that there may be
several cases, in which proof of loss caused by the breach of contract may not be possible and held
that the expression 'where or not actual damages or loss is proved have been caused thereby' is
intended to cover different classes of contract. In case of breach of some contracts, it may not be
possible for the Court to assess compensation arising from breach while in other cases
compensation can be calculated in accordance with the established rules.
7. The Arbitrator observed that in the instant case, the petitioner had deducted 7.5% of the value of
the contract in accordance with clause 8 (v) of the appendix to the contract Ex. RW1/1. The clause
itself states that the recovery of general damages should be based on the loss sustained in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181396592/ 3Union Of India vs Indian Agro Marketing ... on 28 November, 2020
ultimate purchase of the stores. It was held that the respondent has not adduced any evidence to
show the rates OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd
Page No.6 of 45 at which the commodity was actually purchased. Omission to produce such
evidence would give rise to the presumption that the petitioner did not suffer any monetary loss and
therefore, forfeiture of a part of the bank guarantee as general damages cannot be upheld. It was
observed that although, the respondent has produced a letter Ex. CW1/9 written by the petitioner
that the Gram Whole was selling @ Rs. 4125/− in the month of May, whereas the stipulated rate was
Rs. 3553/− only but there is no indication in the letter that the petitioner purchased Gram Whole at
that rate. As a matter of fact, the petitioner floated risk purchase inquiry on 09.07.2012 and
therefore, the question of any market purchase being made in May 2012 does not arise. It cannot
however be said that the petitioner did not suffer any legal injury at all. The Gram Whole was meant
for consumption for Army Personnel. Delay in supply was likely to disturb the entire schedule of
procurement for the Army Personnel and thereby, it must have caused enormous hardship to the
department of purchase and also the Army Personnel. The purpose for which, the contract is made
has always to be kept in mind. If promise for supply of edible commodities is not to be seriously
enforced, the supplier may take the contract with the Government very lightly. The case of
Construction & Design Services Vs. DDA, Civil Appeal No. 1440−1441 of 2015 was discussed. In that
case, DDA had awarded a contract for construction of sewerage pumping station, it provided for
compensation not exceeding 10% of the estimated cost. The contract was terminated and the
Superintending Engineer levied the compensation for delay in execution of the OMP Comm
No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.7 of 45 project. The
matter went to the Court and the Supreme Court held that the sewerage pumping station is not
something from which revenue would be generated by the Government. It is a public utility service
and has a role to play in maintaining clean environment. The Supreme Court upheld the order of the
Division Bench of the High Court, which held that delay in construction of public utility services
could itself be a ground for compensation without proving the loss. However, the Supreme Court
reduced the amount levied by the Superintending Engineer to half as reasonable compensation.
8. The Arbitrator drawing the analogy from the case supra held that the breach of contract in this
case was likely to disturb the procurement schedule for Armed Forces and delay in supply of edible
items could itself be a ground for compensation without proving the actual loss. Considering the
delay on the part of the respondent and the fact that the petitioner had floated a tender for risk
purchase, the petitioner is entitled to compensation and breach of contract is entirely not
condonable. It was held that the duty of the Arbitrator is to enforce the promises and where the
promises have been broken without justifiable reasons, to award reasonable compensation to the
aggrieved party. In this case, the aggrieved party had entered into the contact for the benefits of
Jawans serving in different areas of the country and it would be totally unfair to ask the petitioner to
refund the entire amount or to refuse reasonable compensation. It was held that 3% of the contract
value will be a reasonable compensation to be awarded to the petitioner, which OMP Comm
No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.8 of 45 comes to Rs.
11,99,137/−
9. Qua issue no. 4 i.e. whether the respondent is entitled to interest, it was held that since the
current bank rate for fixed deposit of five years is around 7% per annum, interest @ 7% per annum
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181396592/ 4Union Of India vs Indian Agro Marketing ... on 28 November, 2020
is awarded. Since, the petitioner has received the interest on the amount of bank guarantee, which it
converted into cash surety, it is liable to pay interest.
10. Qua issue no. 1 i.e. whether the claim is barred by limitation, it was held that the matter was
referred to the Arbitrator by the High Court vide order dated 23.02.2015. Similar objection was
raised by the petitioner before the High Court that since the claim has not been preferred within one
year of the completion of the contract, it cannot be referred to the Arbitration. This contention was
rejected by the High Court holding that such a clause is hit by Section 28 of the Contract Act, 1872.
It was held by the Arbitrator that in this case the request for invoking the arbitration was made by
the respondent within three years of cancellation of contract and therefore, it cannot be held that the
claim is barred by limitation. Section 21 & 43 of the Act were referred and it was stated that Section
43 of the Act, makes applicable to arbitrations, the provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963.
11. The petitioner challenged the impugned award on the following grounds:
A. That the impugned award is bad in the eyes of law as it OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs.
Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.9 of 45 suffers from serious legal infirmities
arising out of non− application of mind and errors apparent on the face of record. The conduct of
the respondent elicits that it was not serious in its approach to the contract. Being fully aware of the
delivery period which was extended upto 31.03.2012, it pleaded that such item is a seasonal crop
grown once a year and supply DP period is next to impossible. The Arbitrator failed to consider that
the respondent took this plea to hide its short coming. Therefore, encashment of the bank guarantee
cannot be considered to be illegal.
B. That the Arbitrator himself had declined the vague plea of the respondent of seasonal crop but
still he reduced the percentage of compensation from 7.5% to 3% that too without giving any proper
and detailed reasoning, which is contradictory of his own observation. He failed to consider that the
respondent had committed the breach of contract by not supplying the material within stipulated
time period and as per clause 7 (4) of the revised DGS & D 68, which is part & parcel of the contract,
if the respondent fails to supply the items within the stipulated time, the contract shall stand
terminated. It is stated that in the case of ONGC Vs. SAW Pipes Limited, Appeal No. 7419 of 2001, it
was held that the terms of the contract are required to be taken into consideration and if the terms
are clear stipulating the liquidated damages, in case of breach unless held that such estimate of
damages / compensation is unreasonable or is by way of penalty, the party, who committed the
breach is required to pay such compensation, i.e. what is provided in Section 73 of the Contract Act.
Section 74 of the Act is to be read with Section 73 of the Act and in every case of breach of contract,
the person aggrieved by the breach is not required to prove the actual loss or damages suffered by
him and the Court is competent to award reasonable compensation, even if no actual damage is
proved. In some contracts, it is not possible for the Court to assess the compensation and if the
compensation contemplated is not by way of penalty or unreasonable the Court can award the same,
if it is genuine pre−estimate by the parties as a measure of reasonable compensation.

C. That the Arbitrator failed to consider that as per clause 14 (7) (i) of the revised DGS & D 68, if the
contractor fails to deliver stores or any installment thereof, within the period fixed for such delivery
or at any time, repudiates the contract before the expiry of such period, the Secretary may without
prejudice to the right of the purchaser to recover damages for breach of the contract recover from
the contractor as agreed liquidated damages including administrative expenses and not by way of
penality, a sum equivalent to 2% of the price of any stores, which the contractor has failed to deliver
within the period fixed for delivery in the schedule for each month provided that total damages so
claimed shall not exceed 10% of the total contract price. It was also stipulated in clause 8 (III) of the
tender inquiry that the Chief Director of Purchase reserves the right to allow extension of delivery
period subject to the recovery of liquidated damages upto 2% per month or part thereof provided
that total damages so claimed shall not exceed 10% of the total contract price. It is stated that the
amount deducted by the petitioner was well in the ambit of the contract and the same was much less
than what has been stated in the contract. The loss which the petitioner has suffered in itself is a
ground of compensation and therefore, the amount deducted is totally legal.
D. That the Arbitrator while imposing the penality failed to appreciate the Para 14 (7) of the revised
DGS & D 68. It is stated that the pre−estimated damages at the rate of 10% of the contract value was
not by way of penality as the same was a part of pre−estimated damages which was duly agreed by
the parties vide agreement. The petitioner could have deducted the amount upto 10% but it has
deducted only 7.5% amount in a fair manner and as per actual pre−estimated loss caused to it but
the Arbitrator reduced it to 3%, which is not only illegal but contrary to law and against the
principles of Natural Justice. It is stated that the Arbitrator does not have power to supersede the
terms & conditions of a valid contract, which he did erroneously arbitrarily and without application
of mind. It is stated that in the case OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro
Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.11 of 45 of Construction & Design Services Vs. DDA, Civil
Appeal No. 1440−1441 of 2015 decided on 04.02.2015, it was held that it could certainly be
presumed that delay in executing the work resulted in loss for which, the party is entitled to
reasonable compensation. Evidence of precise of loss may not be possible and in that case, the Court
has to proceed on the guess work as to the quantum of reasonable compensation.
E. That the Arbitrator wrongly calculated the amount and the rate of interest.
12. Notice of the petition was served on the respondent but it chose not to file any reply.
13. I have heard Ld. Counsel Sh. Jalaj Aggarwal for the petitioner/objector and Sh. Vijay Kasana, Ld.
Counsel for the respondent/claimant.
14. Ld. Counsel for the petitioner / objector reiterated what has been stated in the petition and
contended that the scope of interference under Section 34 of the Act is well settled in the decision of
the Supreme Court in the case of ONGC Vs. Saw Pipes Ltd (supra), where, it was held that the Public
Policy of India used in Section 34 is required to be given a wider meaning, which concerns public
good & public interest. The award, which is on the face of it, patently in violence of statutory
provision cannot be said to be in public interest as it is likely to adversely affect the administration
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181396592/ 6Union Of India vs Indian Agro Marketing ... on 28 November, 2020
of justice. The award could be set aside if it is contrary to Fundamental Policy of Indian Law,
Interest of India, Justice on Morality or patently illegal. Illegality must go to the root of the matter
and should not be of trivial nature. Award could be set aside, if it is so OMP Comm No.42/19 Union
of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.12 of 45 unfair and unreasonable that
it shocks the conscience of the Court.
15. Ld. Counsel contended that clause 14 (7) (i) of the revised DGS & D 68 provides that if the
contractor fails to deliver the material on time, the petitioner can deduct upto 10% of the total
contract price. Although, the Arbitrator has correctly held in the award that he does not find any
infirmity in the act of the petitioner in cancelling the contract and it cannot be said that the
respondent did not suffer any legal injury at all. Delay in supply was likely to disturb the entire
schedule of procurement for the Army Personnel and it must have caused enormous hardship to the
department of purchase and the Army Personnel and it would be totally unfair to ask the petitioner
to refund the entire amount and to refuse the reasonable compensation but the Arbitrator has
wrongly held that 3% of the contract value would be a reasonable compensation to be awarded to the
petitioner. Ld. Counsel contended that the interest, which has been awarded @ 7% of the amount,
which has been retained by the petitioner is also erroneous and the Arbitrator has committed an
error, which is against the Public Policy as it would adversely affect the administration of justice. Ld.
Counsel referred the case of Associated Engineering Company Vs. Government of Andhra Pradesh,
AIR 1992 SC 234 to contend that the Arbitrator cannot act arbitrarily, irrationally, capriciously or
independently of the contract. He has no power apart from what the parties have given him under
the contract and if he has travelled outside the bounds of the contract, he can be said to have acted
without jurisdiction. Ld. Counsel contended that the Arbitrator was not vested with the OMP Comm
No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.13 of 45 powers to
amend or bring changes in the terms & conditions of the contract neither it was the prayer of the
respondent in its claims before the Arbitrator and in such conditions, the relief granted by the
Arbitrator is strictly against the Public Policy. Ld. Counsel referred the case of ONGC Limited Vs.
Saw Pipes (supra) to contend that when the parties have expressly agreed that the recovery for the
breach of contract is pre−estimated genuine liquidated damages and not by way of penalty, there is
no justifiable reason for the Arbitrator to arrive at a conclusion that still the purchaser should prove
the loss suffered by it. He is only required to decide the dispute in accordance with the terms of the
contract. Ld. Counsel stated that in the instant case, the respondent failed to deliver the goods to the
petitioner in time and the petitioner rightly invoked the clause 14 (7) of the revised DGS & D 68 and
deducted 7.5% of the bank guarantee. Ld. Counsel contended that the case Construction & Design
Services Vs. DDA (supra) relied upon by the Arbitrator does not have any bearing on the facts &
circumstances of the case as the subject matter in that case was not an Arbitration but a Civil Suit.
Ld. Counsel referred clause 18 (d) (viii) of the appendix to the contract Ex. RW1/1, which stated that
"except any matter the decision of which is specially provided for", excludes the power of the
Arbitrator to interfere in the contract, where the power has given to someone else to adjudicate the
issue. In the present case, the parties have agreed that the Chief Director of Purchase will have the
right to encash the bank guarantee, if there is any breach of contract and thus, the Arbitrator cannot
interfere in the same. Ld. Counsel OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing
Co−operative Ltd Page No.14 of 45 referred the case of Viswanath Sood Vs. Union of India & Anr
(1989) 1 SCC 657, which has been relied upon in the case of M/s Mitra Guha Builders Vs. ONGC,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181396592/ 7Union Of India vs Indian Agro Marketing ... on 28 November, 2020
Civil Appeal No. 5519 of 2012 decided on 08.11.2019, wherein, it was held that the decision of the
Superintending Engineer is in the nature of a considered decision, which he has to arrive at after
considering the various mitigating circumstances that may be pleaded by the contractor. Amount of
compensation leviable under clause 2 has to be decided only by the Superintending Engineer and no
one else. The amount of compensation is strictly limited to a maximum of 10% with a wide margin
of discretion of the Superintending Engineer, who might not only reduce the percentage but can
even reduce it to nil, if the circumstance so warrants. It is this power which is kept outside the scope
of arbitration. Ld. Counsel stated that the ratio of the above decision squarely applies in this case.
Once the parties have decided that certain matters are to be decided by the Chief Director of
Purchase and his decision would be final, the same cannot be the subject matter of Arbitration.
16. Ld. Counsel for the respondent per contra argued that the petition is not maintainable. In the
instant case, the petitioner has challenged the findings of facts recorded by the Arbitrator on the
basis of appreciation of evidence, which cannot be challenged under Section 34 of the Act. The
Arbitrator has correctly interpreted the terms of the contract and his award is confined within the
contract. He has not exceeded his jurisdiction nor can the award be said to be OMP Comm No.42/19
Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.15 of 45 against the Public
Policy of India, perverse or against the canons of justice. Ld. Counsel contended that the respondent
is a co−operative society in which more than 200 farmers are the members. The petitioner did not
suffer any loss as no document in this respect was produced by the petitioner before the Arbitrator
and therefore, petitioner is not entitled to any compensation.
17. I have given my thoughtful consideration to the rival contentions and gone through the
impugned award, records of the case and the case laws supra.
18. Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act reads as under:
"34.Application for setting aside arbitral award− (1)Recourse to a court against an
arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in
accordance with sub−section (2) and sub− sec− tion (3).
(2)An arbitral award may be set aside by the court only if−
(a) the party making the application furnishes proof that−
(i) a party was under some incapacity, or
(ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or,
failing any in− dication thereon, under the law for the time being in force; or
(iii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an
arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or OMP Comm

(iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not contem− plated by or not falling within the terms of
the submis− sion to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the
submission to arbitration; Provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be
separated from those not so submit− ted, only that part of the arbitral award which contains
decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration may be set aside; or
(v) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the
agreement of the parties, unless such agreement was in conflict with a provision of this Part from
which the parties cannot derogate, or, failing such agreement, was not in accor− dance with this
Part; or
(b) the court finds that−
(i) the subject−matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law for the
time be− ing in force, or
(ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public pol− icy of India.
Explanation− I For the avoidance of any doubt, it is clar− ified that an award is in conflict with the
public policy of India only if the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption
or was in violation of Section 75 or Section 81."
ii) It is in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law;
iii) It is in conflict with the most basic notions of moral− ity or justice.
Explanation−II− For the avoidance of doubt, the test as to whether there is a contravention with the
fundamen− tal policy of Indian law shall not entail a review on the merits of the dispute.
[2 (A) An arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than international commercial arbitrations,
may also be set aside by the court, if the court finds that the award is vitiated by patent illegality
appearing on the face of the award: Provided that an award shall not be set aside merely on the
ground of an erroneous application of the law or by reappreciation of evidence.
OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.17 of 45
19. Normally, general principles are that the decision of the Arbi− trator unless there is an error
apparent on the face of the award which makes it unsustainable, is not to be set aside even if the
court as a court of law would come to a different conclusion on the same facts. The court cannot
reappraise the evidence and it is not open to the court to sit in appeal over the conclusion of the
arbitrator. It is not open to the court to set aside a finding of fact arrived at by the arbitrator and
only grounds on which the award can be cancelled are those mentioned in the Arbitration Act.
Where the arbitrator assigns cogent grounds and sufficient reasons and no error of law or miscon−
duct is cited, the award will not call for interference by the court in exercise of the power vested in it.

20. In the case of Hiedelberg Cement India Ltd Vs. The Indure Pvt Ltd, OMP (Comm) No. 413/2019
decided on 29.01.2020, it was held that law of judicial review and interference in proceedings un−
der Section 34 of the Act is no more res integra. Reference of the case Associate Builders v/s Delhi
Development Authority, (2015) 3 SCC 49 was made, where the Supreme Court has held as under:−
"19. When it came to construing the expression the pub− lic policy of India contained in Section
34(2)(b)(ii) of the Arbitration Act, 1996, this Court in ONGC Ltd. v. Saw Pipes Ltd. (2003) 5 SCC
705 : held: (SCC pp.
727−28 & 744−45, paras 31 & 74)
31. Therefore, in our view, the phrase public policy of India used in Section 34 in context is required
to be given a wider meaning. It can be stated that the concept OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India
Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.18 of 45 of public policy connotes some matter
which concerns public good and the public interest. What is for public good or in public interest or
what would be injurious or harmful to the public good or public interest has varied O.M.P. (COMM)
413/2019 Page 30 of 37 from time to time. However, the award which is, on the face of it, patently in
violation of statutory provisions cannot be said to be in public interest. Such award/judgment/deci−
sion is likely to adversely affect the administration of justice. Hence, in our view in addition to
narrower meaning given to the term public policy in Renusagar case [Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v.
General Electric Co., 1994 Supp (1) SCC 644] it is required to be held that the award could be set
aside if it is patently illegal.
The result would be award could be set aside if it is contrary to: (a) fundamental policy of Indian
law; or (b) the interest of India; or (c) justice or morality, or (d) in addition, if it is patently illegal.
Illegality must go to the root of the matter and if the il− legality is of trivial nature it cannot be held
that award is against the public policy. Award could also be set aside if it is so unfair and
unreasonable that it shocks the conscience of the court. Such award is opposed to public policy and
is required to be adjudged void.
74. In the result, it is held that: (A)(1) The court can set aside the arbitral award under Section 34(2)
of the Act if the party making the application furnishes proof that:
(i) a party was under some incapacity, or
(ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or,
failing any in− dication thereon, under the law for the time being in force; or
(iii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment of an
arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or OMP Comm
No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.19 of 45
(iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not contem− plated by or not falling within the terms of
the O.M.P. (COMM) 413/2019 Page 31 of 37 submission to arbi− tration, or it contains decisions on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181396592/ 10Union Of India vs Indian Agro Marketing ... on 28 November, 2020
matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration.
(2) The court may set aside the award:
(i)(a) if the composition of the Arbitral Tribunal was not in accordance with the agreement of the
parties, (b) fail− ing such agreement, the composition of the Arbitral Tri− bunal was not in
accordance with Part I of the Act,
(ii) if the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with:
(a) the agreement of the parties, or (b) failing such agreement, the arbitral procedure was not in
accordance with Part I of the Act. However, exception for setting aside the award on the ground of
composition of Arbi− tral Tribunal or illegality of arbitral procedure is that the agreement should
not be in conflict with the provisions of Part I of the Act from which parties cannot derogate.
(c) If the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal is in contravention of the provisions of the Act or
any other substantive law governing the parties or is against the terms of the contract.
(3) The award could be set aside if it is against the pub− lic policy of India, that is to say, if it is
contrary to: (a) fundamental policy of Indian law; or (b) the interest of India; or (c) justice or
morality; or (d) if it is patently il− legal. (4) It could be challenged: (a) as provided under Section
13(5); and (b) Section 16(6) of the Act.......
44. It was held that in the very recent judgments, the Supreme Court has once again reiterated the
law related to the examination by a Court of an Award under Section 34 of the Act. In Ssangyong
Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. vs. Na− tional Highways Authority of India Ltd. 2019 SCC On−
Line SC 677, the Supreme Court has held as under:− OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs.
Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.20 of 45
35. What is clear, therefore, is that the expression public policy of India, whether contained in
Section 34 or in Section 48, would now mean the fundamental policy of Indian law as explained in
paragraphs 18 and 27 of As− sociate Builders (supra), i.e., the fundamental policy of Indian law
would be relegated to the Renusagar under− standing of this expression. This would necessarily
mean that the Western Geco (supra) expansion has been done away with. In short, Western Geco
(supra), as ex− plained in paragraphs 28 and 29 of Associate Builders (supra), would no longer
obtain, as under the guise of interfering with an award on the ground that the arbitra− tor has not
adopted a judicial approach, the Court's in− tervention would be on the merits of the award, which
cannot be permitted post amendment. However, insofar as principles of natural justice are
concerned, as con− tained in Sections 18 and 34(2)(a)(iii) of the 1996 Act, these continue to be
grounds of challenge of an award, as is contained in paragraph 30 of Associate Builders (supra).
36. It is important to notice that the ground for interfer− ence insofar as it concerns interest of India
has since been deleted, and therefore, no longer obtains. Equally, the ground for interference on the
basis that the award is in conflict with justice or morality is now to be under− stood as a conflict with
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181396592/ 11Union Of India vs Indian Agro Marketing ... on 28 November, 2020
the most basic notions of moral− ity or justice. This again would be in line with O.M.P. (COMM)
413/2019 Page 34 of 37 paragraphs 36 to 39 of Associate Builders (supra), as it is only such arbitral
awards that shock the conscience of the court that can be set aside on this ground.
37. Thus, it is clear that public policy of India is now constricted to mean firstly, that a domestic
award is contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian law, as un− derstood in paragraphs 18 and 27
of Associate Builders (supra), or secondly, that such award is against basic notions of justice or
morality as understood in para− graphs 36 to 39 of Associate Builders (supra). Explana− tion 2 to
Section 34(2)(b)(ii) and Explanation 2 to Sec− tion 48(2)(b)(ii) was added by the Amendment Act
only so that Western Geco (supra), as understood in Asso− OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs.
Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.21 of 45 ciate Builders (supra), and paragraphs 28
and 29 in par− ticular, is now done away with.
38. Insofar as domestic awards made in India are con− cerned, an additional ground is now
available under sub−section (2A), added by the Amendment Act, 2015, to Section 34. Here, there
must be patent illegality ap− pearing on the face of the award, which refers to such illegality as goes
to the root of the matter but which does not amount to mere erroneous application of the law. In
short, what is not subsumed within the funda− mental policy of Indian law, namely, the
contravention of a statute not linked to public policy or public interest, cannot be brought in by the
backdoor when it comes to setting aside an award on the ground of patent illegality.
39. Secondly, it is also made clear that re−appreciation of evidence, which is what an appellate court
is permit− ted to do, cannot be permitted under the ground of patent illegality appearing on the face
of the award.
40. To elucidate, paragraph 42.1 of Associate Builders (supra), namely, a mere contravention of the
substan− tive law of India, by itself, is no longer a ground avail− able to set aside an arbitral award.
Paragraph 42.2 of Associate Builders (supra), however, would remain, for if an arbitrator gives no
reasons for an award and con− travenes Section 31(3) of the 1996 Act, that would O.M.P. (COMM)
413/2019 Page 35 of 37 certainly amount to a patent illegality on the face of the award.
41. The change made in Section 28(3) by the Amend− ment Act really follows what is stated in
paragraphs 42.3 to 45 in Associate Builders (supra), namely, that the construction of the terms of a
contract is primarily for an arbitrator to decide, unless the arbitrator con− strues the contract in a
manner that no fair−minded or reasonable person would; in short, that the arbitrator's view is not
even a possible view to take. Also, if the ar− bitrator wanders outside the contract and deals with
matters not allotted to him, he commits an error of juris− diction. This ground of challenge will now
fall within the new ground added under Section 34(2A).
OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.22 of 45
42. What is important to note is that a decision which is perverse, as understood in paragraphs 31
and 32 of As− sociate Builders (supra), while no longer being a ground for challenge under public
policy of India, would certainly amount to a patent illegality appearing on the face of the award.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181396592/ 12Union Of India vs Indian Agro Marketing ... on 28 November, 2020
Thus, a finding based on no evidence at all or an award which ignores vital evidence in arriving at its
decision would be perverse and liable to be set aside on the ground of patent illegality. Addi−
tionally, a finding based on documents taken behind the back of the parties by the arbitrator would
also qualify as a decision based on no evidence inasmuch as such decision is not based on evidence
led by the parties, and therefore, would also have to be characterised as per− verse.
45. It was also observed that recently, in Hindustan Con− struction Company Limited & Anr. Vs.
Union of India & Ors., 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1520, the Apex Court has held as under:−
55. Further, this Court has repeatedly held that an appli− cation under Section 34 of the Arbitration
Act, 1996 is a summary proceeding not in the nature of a regular suit − see Canara Nidhi Ltd. v. M.
Shashikala 2019 SCC O.M.P. (COMM) 413/2019 Page 36 of 37 OnLine SC 1244 at paragraph 20. As
a result, a court reviewing an arbitral award under Section 34 does not sit in appeal over the award,
and if the view taken by the arbitrator is possible, no interference is called for − see Associated
Construction v. Pawanhans Helicopters Limited. (2008) 16 SCC 128 at paragraph 17.
56. Also, as has been held in the recent deci− sion Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. v.
NHAI 2019 SCC OnLine SC 677, after the 2015 Amendment Act, this Court cannot interfere with an
ar− bitral award on merits. "
OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.23 of 45
21. In the backdrop of the above, let me now examine the objec− tions against the impugned award
agitated by Ld. counsel for peti− tioner, vis−a−vis the contentions of Ld. counsel for respondent, in
support of the award.
22. A perusal of record shows that the petitioner had floated ten− der for procurement of 1125 MT
Gram Whole. The respondent par− ticipated in the tender and was awarded the contract for supply
of Gram Whole @ Rs. 3553/− per quintal. As per the delivery schedule, the supply was to be made
from 16.02.2012 to 29.02.2012. The re− spondent furnished an unconditional bank guarantee of Rs.
39,97,125/− in terms of clause 7 (4) of the appendix to the tender, which could be forfeited in case of
breach of contract. The respon− dent did not supply the quantity and was issued a performance
notice dated 12.04.2012 to complete the supply by 14.05.2012 but the re− spondent did not supply
the contracted quantity and its contract was cancelled vide letter dated 29.06.2012 in terms of
clause 8 (ii) of the appendix to the tender and clause 14 (7) (iii) of DGS & D 68. The bank guarantee
was forfeited and the amount was deposited in the Treasury on 16.07.2012. Rs. 29,97,844/− were
retained as general damages and Rs. 9,99,281/− were returned to the respondent out of the forfeited
amount.
23. The question arose before the Arbitrator whether the peti− tioner was entitled to retain the
amount of Rs. 29,97,844/− (7.5% of OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro
Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.24 of 45 the contract value) as general damages or the
respondent was enti− tled to refund of the entire amount of the bank guarantee. In the in− stant
case, the Arbitrator did not accept the plea of the respondent that the performance was virtually
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181396592/ 13Union Of India vs Indian Agro Marketing ... on 28 November, 2020
impossible as the Gram Whole was not available in whole sale mandis. He held that the respondent
being the old vendor should have known before submitting the ten− der whether the Gram Whole
was available or not in the whole sale mandis. It cannot escape from its liability by taking refuse
behind the alleged non−availability. It was observed that Gram Whole is harvested in March / April,
which fact CW1 has admitted, so it must have been available in plenty in the month of April. The
Arbitrator also rejected the contention of the respondent that 30 days clear time for performance
was not given vide notice dated 08.05.2012 and the contract could not have been cancelled on its
basis. It was held that break clause simply means that the contractor should be given 30 days for
performance before cancelling the contract, which was duly followed in this case. It was held that
there was nothing wrongful for the petitioner to invoke the bank guarantee.
24. The Arbitrator also discussed clause 18 (d) (viii), Clause 8 to the appendix to the contract and
Para 7 (4) of the revised DGS & D 68 and held that all the clauses are in the nature of stipulation by
way of penalty. It was held in the case of Maula Bax Vs. Union of India (supra) that where under the
terms / contracts, the party in breach has undertaken to pay a sum of money or to forfeit a sum of
money, which he has already paid to the party complaining of breach OMP Comm No.42/19 Union
of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.25 of 45 of contract, the undertaking
is of the nature of penalty. The Arbitra− tor held that all stipulations by way of penalty are covered
by Sec− tion 74 of Indian Contract Act, which says that the agreed party is entitled to receive
compensation from the party, who has broken the contract, whether or not actual damages or loss is
proved to have been caused by the breach. It merely dispenses with proof of actual loss or damages.
It does not justify the award of compensation, when in consequence of breach, no legal injury has
resulted because com− pensation from breach of contract can be awarded to make good the loss or
damages, which naturally arises in the usual course of things (Fateh Chand Vs. Bal Kishan supra).
The case of ONGC Vs. Saw Pipes (supra) was distinguished.
25. In the case of ONGC Vs. Saw Pipes (supra), the entire amount of security furnished was allowed
to be forfeited. The parties had ex− pressly agreed that the amount was a genuine pre−estimate of
dam− ages and the liquidated damages were not by way of penalty but present is a case where
stipulation by way of penalty was made. It was held in the case supra that it is the primary duty of
the Arbitra− tor to enforce the terms, which the parties had made and to uphold the sanctity of
contract, which forms the basis of civil societies and the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator.
26. In the case of Kailash Nath Vs. DDA (supra), the Supreme Court after a conspectus of several
decisions laid down the following principles:
OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.26 of 45
1. "Where a sum is named in a contract as a liquidated amount payable by way of damages, the party
complaining of a breach can receive reasonable compensation such as liquidated amount, only if it is
a genuine pre−estimate of damages fixed by both the parties and found to be such by the court. In
other cases, where a sum is named in a contract as a liquidated amount payable by way of damages,
only reasonable compensation can be awarded not exceeding the amount so stated. Similarly, in
cases where the amount fixed is in the nature of penalty, only reasonable compensation can be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181396592/ 14Union Of India vs Indian Agro Marketing ... on 28 November, 2020
awarded not exceeding the penalty so stated. In both the cases, the liquidated amount or penalty is
the upper limit beyond which the court cannot grant reasonable compensation.
2. Reasonable compensation will be fixed on well known principles that are applicable to the law of
contract, which are to be found inter alia in Section 73 of the Contract Act.
3. Since Section 74 awards reasonable compensation for damage or loss caused by a breach of
contract, damage or loss caused is a sine qua non for the applicability of the section.
4. The section applies whether a person is a plaintiff or a defendant in a suit.
5. The sum spoken of may already be paid or be payable in future.
6. The expression "whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused thereby"
means that where it is possible to prove actual damage or loss such proof is not dispensed with. It is
only in cases where damage or loss is difficult or impossible to prove, the liquidated amount named
in the contract, if a genuine pre−estimate of damage or loss, can be awarded.
7. Section 74 will apply to cases of forfeiture of earnest money under a contract. Where forfeiture
takes place OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page
No.27 of 45 under the terms and condition of a public auction before agreement is reached, Section
74 would have no application".
27. The Arbitrator observed that in the present case, although, stipulation by way of penalty was
made but the Arbitrator is supposed to protect the promisee by awarding proper compensation and
also at the same time, to protect the interest of the promiser by granting him relief under any
unlawful forfeiture and recovery. Clause 8 (v) states that recovery of general damages should be
based on the loss sustained in the ultimate purchase of the stores. In the instant case, the
respondent has not adduced any evidence to show the rates at which, the commodity was actually
purchased. In the absence thereof, it leads to the presumption that the petitioner did not suffer any
monetary loss and therefore, forfeiture of a part of the bank guarantee as a general damages cannot
be upheld. It was also observed that although, the respondent has produced a letter Ex. CW1/9
written by the petitioner that the Gram Whole was selling at Rs. 4125/− in the month of May 2012,
where as the stipulated rate was Rs. 3553/− only but there is no indication in the letter that the
respondent purchased Gram Whole at that rate. As a matter of fact, the petitioner floated risk
purchase inquiry on 09.07.2012, therefore, question of any market purchase being made in May
2012 does not arise. It was however, observed that it cannot be said that the petitioner did not suffer
any legal injury at all. It was observed that the Gram Whole was meant for consumption for Army
Personnel. Delay in supply was likely to disturb the entire schedule of procurement for the Army
Personnel and thereby, it must have OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro
Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.28 of 45 caused enormous hardship to the department of
purchase and also the Army Personnel. The purpose for which, the contract is made has always to be
kept in mind. If promise for supply of edible commodities is not to be seriously enforced, the
supplier may take the contract with the Government very lightly. Ld. Arbitrator relied upon the case
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181396592/ 15Union Of India vs Indian Agro Marketing ... on 28 November, 2020
Construction Design Services Vs. DDA supra and held that the breach of contract in this case was
likely to disturb the procurement schedule the procurement schedule for Armed Forces and delay in
supply of edible items could itself be a ground for compensation without proving the actual loss.
Considering the delay on the part of the respondent and the fact that the petitioner had floated a
tender for risk purchase, the petitioner is entitled to compensation and breach of contract is entirely
not condonable. It was held that the duty of the Arbitrator is to enforce the promises and where the
promises have been broken without justifiable reasons, to award reasonable compensation to the
aggrieved party. In this case, the aggrieved party had entered into the contact for the benefits of
Jawans serving in different areas of the country and it would be totally unfair to ask the petitioner to
refund the entire amount or to refuse reasonable compensation. It was held that 3% of the contract
value would be a reasonable compensation to be awarded to the petitioner, which comes to Rs.
11,99,137/−.
28. The question arises whether the Arbitrator travelled outside the bounds of the contract or he
acted without jurisdiction or by virtue of clause 18 (d) (viii) of the appendix to the contract Ex.
OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.29 of 45
RW1/1, the Arbitrator is excluded with the powers to interfere in the contract and that the power
was given to the Chief Director of Purchase. In order to appreciate this question, it is relevant to
refer some of the clauses of the contract and the revised DGS & D 68.
The acceptance letter dated 09.02.2012 Ex. CW2/3 provides that the contract will be governed by
the general conditions of the contract (Form DGS & D 68−revised) except clause 14 (8) and clause
24 thereof as contained in the pamphlet.
Clause 8.1 of the contract Ex. RW1/1 provides that for any breach of contract or non−compliance /
violation of any terms & conditions or for default, the CDP reserves the contractual and legal right to
cancel the contract at the risk and cost of the supplier / tenderer and resort to repurchase of the
defaulted item by way of Risk Purchase (RP). In such a case, tenderer / supplier, who was
responsible for such breach / default is liable to refund the extra expenditure on such risk purchase
along with interest.
Clause 8 of appendix to condition of contract provides that in the event of a supplier failing to tender
the whole or part of the local supplies by the due date, the Chief Director of Purchase or any person
authorized to act on his behalf may at his sole discretion−
(i) Extend the delivery date without or with the levy of liquidated damages upto 2% of the value of
the supplies per month or a part of the month for the period between the date when supplies are
tendered and date when they were due or.
(ii) Cancel the outstanding quantity under the contract, or
(iii) Cancel the outstanding quantity under the contract and recover in respect thereof from the
seller the difference OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative

Ltd Page No.30 of 45 between the price at which the quantity may be repurchased or the market rate
on the date of breach of the contract and the price payable under the contract.
(iv) It should be noted that if a contract is placed on higher tenderer as a result of this tender in
reference to the lowest acceptable offer in consideration of offer of earlier delivery the contractor
will be liable to pay to the Government the difference between the contract within the date of
delivery specified in the tender and incorporated in the contract. This is in addition to the
Government right to the conciliation of the contract or repurchase at the contractors risk and
expense as stipulated in sub clause (ii) and (iii) or any other remedies for breach of contract.
(v) In case risk purchase is made on higher rate and supplies do not materialize, the Government
will be in its rights to recover general damages of 7.5% the value of the defaulted contract based on
the loss sustained in the ultimate purchase of the stores.
29. Clause 18 (d) (viii) of the appendix to the contract Ex. RW1/1 provides that....... the Chief
Director of Purchase also reserves the right to convert the bank guarantee into cash surety by
encash− ment of the bank guarantee in case of any breach of the contract by the contractor or by not
delivering the stores by the due date of the contract.......
30. The contract also contains an arbitration clause 19, which pro− vides that in the event of any
question, dispute or difference aris− ing out of or in connection with the conditions mentioned in
this schedule or in general conditions of contract (as contained in the pamphlet conditions of
contract) placed by Army Purchase Orga− OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro

matters the decision of which is specially provided for in the conditions mentioned in the schedule
or in Annexe thereto or in General conditions of contract as aforesaid), the same shall be referred to
arbitration of any person appointed by the Secretary of the Government of India, Ministry or
Depart− ment of Government of India administratively dealing with the contract at the time of such
appointment, or if there be no Secre− tary, the administrative head of such Ministry or Department
at the time of such appointment.
31. Form DGS & D 68 (Revised) provides the General Condi− tions of Contract. As per Para / clause
7 (1) (iv) (b), the Pur− chaser is the sole judge to decide whether the supplier had com− mitted a
breach of contract or not. Para /clause 7 (4) provides that if the contractor fails or neglects to
observe or perform any of his obligation under the contract, it shall be lawful for the Secretary to
forfeit either in whole or in part the security deposit furnished by the contractor... and the Secretary
shall refund the security de− posit to the contractor after deducting all cost and other expenses that
the purchaser may have incurred and all dues another mon− OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India

which the purchaser is enti− tled to recover from the contractor.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181396592/ 17Union Of India vs Indian Agro Marketing ... on 28 November, 2020
Para / clause 14 (7) (i) provides that if the contractor fails to deliver the stores or any installment
thereof within the period fixed for such delivery or at any time repudiates the contract be− fore the
expiry of such period, the Secretary may without preju− dice to the right of the purchaser to recover
damages for breach of the contract recover from the contractor as agreed liquidated damages
including administrative expenses and not by way of penalty a sum equivalent to 2% of the price of
any stores which the contractor has failed to deliver within the period fixed for de− livery in the
schedule for each month or part of a month during which the delivery of such stores may be in
arrears where deliv− ery thereof is accepted after expiry of the aforesaid period pro− vided that the
total damages so claimed shall not exceed 10% of the total contract price.
32. In the instant petition, neither the petitioner nor the respon− dent disputed the findings /
observations of the Arbitrator that the respondent cannot escape liability by taking refuse behind
the al− leged non−availability and restrictive terms. It was also observed that the respondent was
given ample opportunity for performance in accordance with the break clause before cancellation of
con− tract. The Arbitrator also did not find any infirmity in the act of petitioner in cancelling the
contract. He held that there is nothing OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro
Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.33 of 45 unlawful for the petitioner invoking the bank
guarantee and con− verting the bank guarantee in cash.
33. On a careful reading of the above clauses / paras / provisions, I find that the Arbitrator has given
logical and meaningful inter− pretation to the clause 18 (d) (viii), clause 8 (v) of the appendix to the
contract Ex. RW1/1 and clause / Para 7 (4) of DGS & D 68 that all these clauses are in the nature of
stipulation by way of penalty. It was held in the case of Maula Bax Vs. Union of India (supra) that
where under the terms / contracts, the party in breach has undertaken to pay a sum of money or to
forfeit for a sum of money, which he has already paid to the party complaining of breach of contract,
the undertaking is of the nature of penalty. In the case of Fateh Chand Vs. Bal Kishan, it was held
that under Section 74 of the Contract Act, aggrieved party is entitled to re− ceive compensation from
the party, who has broken the contract whether or not actually damages or loss is proved to have
been caused by the breach. It merely dispenses with the proof of actual loss or damages. It does not
justify the award of compensation when in consequence of the breach, no legal injury at all has re−
sulted because compensation for breach of contract can be awarded to make good the loss or
damage, which naturally arises in the usual course of things. This principle was reiterated in the case
of Kailash Nath Vs. DDA (supra), where, it was held that where a sum is named in a contract as a
liquidated amount payable by way of damages, the party complaining of a breach OMP Comm
No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.34 of 45 can receive
as reasonable compensation such liquidated amount only if it is a genuine pre−estimate of damages
fixed by both par− ties and found to be such by the court. In other cases, where a sum is named in a
contract as a liquidated amount payable by way of damages, only reasonable compensation can be
awarded not exceeding the amount so stated. Similarly, in cases where the amount fixed is in the
nature of penalty, only reasonable com− pensation can be awarded not exceeding the penalty so
stated. In both cases, the liquidated amount or penalty is the upper limit be− yond which the court
cannot grant reasonable compensation.

34. In the case of ONGC Vs. Saw Pipes Limited (supra) the entire amount of security furnished by
the contractor was allowed to be forfeited. The parties had expressly agreed that the amount was a
genuine pre-estimate of damages and the liquidated damages were not by way of penalty but present
is a case where stipula- tion by way of penalty was made. Further, in the instant case, the petitioner
has not adduced any evidence to show the rates at which the commodity was actually purchased
after the contract was cancelled. Thus, in the absence of any evidence, the Arbitra- tor has rightly
presumed that the respondent did not suffer any monetary loss and held that forfeiture of a part of
bank guarantee as general damages cannot be upheld. I also agree with the view taken by the
Arbitrator that it cannot however be said that the pe- titioner did not suffer any legal injury at all.
The Gram Whole was meant for consumption for Army Personnel. Delay in supply was likely to
disturb the entire schedule of procurement for the OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian
Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.35 of 45 Army Personnel and thereby, it must have
caused enormous hardship to the department of purchase and also the Army Per- sonnel. The
purpose for which, the contract is made has always to be kept in mind. If promise for supply of
edible commodities are not to be seriously enforced, the supplier may take the con- tract with the
Government very lightly. He also observed that the breach of contract in this case was likely to
disturb the procure- ment schedule for Armed Forces and delay in supply of edible items could itself
be a ground for compensation without proving the actual loss. It was held that the duty of the
Arbitrator is to en- force the promises and where the promises have been broken without justifiable
reasons, to award reasonable compensation to the aggrieved party. In this case, the aggrieved party
had entered into the contact for the benefits of Jawans serving in different ar- eas of the country and
it would be totally unfair to ask the peti- tioner to refund the entire amount or to refuse reasonable
com- pensation. He supported his decision by referring to the case of Construction & Design
Services Vs. DDA (supra).
35. It was contended by Ld. Counsel for the petitioner that the amount deducted by the petitioner
was well in the ambit of the contract and more so, the same was much less than what was stated in
the contract. The loss which the petitioner has suffered is itself a ground for compensation and the
amount deducted by the petitioner is totally legal. As per the agreement, the petitioner could deduct
the amount upto 10% but it deducted only 7.5% in fair manner as per actual pre−estimated loss
caused to it but the OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative
Ltd Page No.36 of 45 Arbitrator reduced it into 3% arbitrarily without any power su− perseding the
terms & conditions of a valid agreement. It was also contended that by virtue of clause 18 (d) (viii) of
the appen− dix of the contract Ex. RW1/1, the Arbitrator is excluded with the powers to interfere in
the contract and that the power has been given to the Chief Director of Purchase to adjudicate the
is− sue. In support of his contentions, he referred the case of M/s Mi− tra Guha Builders Vs. ONGC
Limited (supra).
36. Ld. Counsel for the respondent per contra argued that findings of facts as well as of law of
Arbitrator are not ordinarily amenable to interference under Section 34 of the Act. The scope of
interference is only where finding of Arbitrator is either con− trary to the terms of contract or ex
facie perverse. Arbitrator is the only final Arbitrator on facts as well as in law and even er− rors,
factual or legal, which stop short of perversity do not merit interference under Section 34 as the
Court is not actually sitting as a Court of appeal over the award and it would not re−appreci− ate or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181396592/ 19Union Of India vs Indian Agro Marketing ... on 28 November, 2020
re−assess the evidence.
37. I have considered the submissions, relevant clauses of the contract and the judgment in the case
of M/s Mitra Guha Builders (supra). In that case, the issue involved before the Divi− sion Bench of
High Court was interpretation of clause 2 of the contract regarding liquidated damages /
compensation levied by the Superintending Engineer and the finality attached to it. It was OMP
Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.37 of 45
contended by the respondent− ONGC that the decision of the Su− perintending Engineer to levy
liquidated damages under clause 2 being final, the same was an excepted matter and not arbitrable.
The Division Bench held that clause 2 of the agreement provided that the decision of the
Superintending Engineer on the question of levy of liquidated damages is final and the same could
not have been agitated in the arbitration proceedings. When the par− ties have consciously provided
that the decision of the Superin− tending Engineer shall be final only to exclude the issue of ex−
cepted matter from the scope of the arbitration, the Arbitrator ought not to have dealt with the same
and pass the award. The matter went to the Supreme Court. Clause 2 of the agreement was referred,
which provided that the time allowed for carrying out the work as entered in the tender shall be
strictly observed by the contractor and shall be deemed to be the essence of the con− tract on the
part of the contractor and......... the work shall throughout, the stipulated period of the contract be
proceeded with all due diligence and the contractor shall pay compensation on the amount equal to
½% per week as the Superintending Engi− neer (whose decision in writing shall be final) may
decide on the amount of the contract, value of the whole work as shown in the agreement, for every
week that the work remains uncom− menced, or unfinished, after the proper dates...... It was held
that a reading of clause 2 makes it clear that the Superintending Engi− neer has been conferred with
not only a right to levy compensa− tion; but it also provides a mechanism for determination of the
li− OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.38
of 45 ability / quantum of compensation. The very clause 2 itself would show that such a decision
taken by the Superintending En− gineer shall be final. The finality clause in the contract in terms of
clause 2 makes the intention of the parties very clear that there cannot be any further dispute on the
said issue between the par− ties; much less before the arbitrator. It was observed that the in−
tention of the parties to exclude some of the decision of the Su− perintending Engineer will be final
and would not be opened to arbitration (Emphasis added). By virtue of the finality clause in the
contract, any decision taken by the Superintending Engineer in levying compensation cannot be
referred to an arbitrator. Any other meaning to the finality clause in the contract and allowing
further adjudication by another authority would make the agreed clause 2 and clause 25 of the
agreement meaningless and redun− dant.
In the instant case, none of the clauses of the contract Ex. RW1/1 or the revised DGS & D 68
excludes the scope of the ar− bitration or the power of the Arbitrator. It was not stipulated in the
contract nor the parties had expressly / consciously agreed that the decision of the Chief Director of
Purchase on the ques− tion of the levy of liquidated damages / compensation would be final to
exclude it from the scope of arbitration. There is no final− ity clause as that in the case of M/s Mitra
Guha Builders (supra). That being the position, the Arbitrator was within his jurisdiction to
adjudicate the question of levy of compensation / liquidated damages. The contention of Ld.
Counsel that the Arbitrator ex− OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181396592/ 20Union Of India vs Indian Agro Marketing ... on 28 November, 2020
Co−operative Ltd Page No.39 of 45 ceeded his jurisdiction or went beyond the terms & conditions of
the agreement is not tenable. The arbitration agreement clearly provides that in the event of any
question, dispute or difference arising under these conditions or any special condition of con− tract
or in connection with the contract (except as to any matter the decision of which is specially
provided for in the conditions mentioned in the schedule or in Annexe thereto or in general
condition of contract as aforesaid), the same shall be referred to the Sole Arbitrator.
38. As regards the contention that the Arbitrator arbitrarily re− duced the reasonable compensation
from 7.5% to 3% of the con− tract value, I am of the view that the Arbitrator has considered all the
relevant facts & circumstances while awarding the reasonable compensation, which is supported
with detailed reasoning. He has taken note of the fact that the supply was required for troops in the
border areas. Due to non−supply of the contractor quantity, the petitioner had to incur loss, which
cannot be collated or quan− tified. In that process, the Army Officers & Bureaucrats had many
rounds of meetings, which had consumed lot of time. Due to breach, the whole exercise went waste
affecting the opera− tional efficiency of the troops, who were deprived of essential nutrients and
adequate variety in their daily diet, which is essen− tial for maintaining good health and moral. In
border areas, timely supply of ration is crucial for substance of the troops. In high altitude areas,
supply is to be completed by September / Oc− OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro
Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.40 of 45 tober before the roads and passages get closed due to
heavy snow and inclement weather. He has also taken note of the fact that in the instant case, the
petitioner has not adduced any evidence to show the rates at which the commodity was actually
purchased nor based its conclusion that the deduction @ 7.5% of the value of the contract was the
pre−estimated liquidated damages. The Arbitrator has also supported his reasoning by referring the
case of Construction & Design Service vs. DDA (supra), wherein, it was held that delay in
construction of a public utility services could itself be a ground for compensation without proving
the loss. The Supreme Court however, reduced the amount levied to half as reasonable
compensation.
39. For the aforesaid discussions, I do not find any reason to in− terfere in the findings given by the
Arbitrator while deciding the issue no. 2 that 3% of the contract value would be a reasonable
compensation to be awarded to the petitioner which comes to Rs. 11,99,137/− thereby directing the
respondent / petitioner to refund the amount of bank guarantee after deducting 3% of the contract
value. The above findings have been given after assessing and evaluating all the facts &
circumstances and the provisions of the contract and it cannot said that the Arbitrator acted
unfairly, arbi− trarily and did not apply his mind while awarding the reasonable compensation.
Further, these findings are the findings on facts, which do not call for interference as envisaged in
Section 34 of the Arbitration Act.
OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.41 of 45
40. Now coming to issue no. 4 i.e. interest, it is an admitted case of the parties that the petitioner
cancelled the contract on 29.06.2012 and encashed the bank guarantee on 16.07.2012. It later
informed the respondent that it has retained an amount of Rs. 29,97,844/− as general damages.
Record shows that the amount of Rs. 9,99,281/− was not immediately refunded to the re− spondent
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181396592/ 21Union Of India vs Indian Agro Marketing ... on 28 November, 2020
and it remained in the Treasury of the petitioner for a considerable time without any justifiable
reason. The Arbitrator has assumed that the current bank rate for the fixed deposit of five years is
around 7% per annum. He therefore, awarded the in− terest @ 7% per annum, which the petitioner
has been receiving on the bank guarantee, which it converted into cash surety. I am of the view that
the Arbitrator was within his competence to award reasonable interest under Section 31 (7) of the
Arbitration Act, which he has awarded in this case. In the case of MSK Projects (I) (JV) Ltd Vs. State
of Rajasthan & Anr, 2011 (8) JT 37 (SC), it was held that Arbitrator is competent to award interest
for the period commencing with the date of award or the date of decree or date of realization,
whichever is earlier.
41. Since, in the instant case, the petitioner is made liable to re− fund the amount of bank guarantee
after deducting the reasonable compensation i.e. 3% of the contract value, the Arbitrator has rightly
directed the petitioner to refund the amount of Rs. 28,97,988/− after adjusting Rs. 9,99,281/− and
to pay interest @ OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd
Page No.42 of 45 7% per annum on 28,97,988/− from the date of encashment of bank guarantee till
the date of payment of Rs. 9,99,281/− and Rs. 18,98,707/− from the date of partial payment till the
date of actual payment.
42. For the aforesaid discussions, I do not find any reason to in− terfere in the above findings of the
Arbitrator on the above is− sues.
Conclusion:
43. Now to sum up, in the instant case, most of the grounds raised by the petitioner to challenge the
award are factual in na- ture which have been already considered and adjudicated in the impugned
award. It is outside the scope of Section 34 of the Act to reappreciate the entire evidence and come
to conclusion be- cause such an approach would defeat the purpose of arbitration proceedings. It
has been consistently held that when a court is applying the public policy test to an arbitration
award, it does not act as a court of appeal and consequently, errors of facts cannot be corrected. A
possible view by the arbitrator on facts has neces- sarily to pass muster as the arbitrator is the
ultimate master of the quality and quantity of evidence to be relied upon when he deliv- ers his
arbitral award. Once, it is found that the arbitrator's ap- proach is not arbitrary or capricious, then
he is the last word on facts. (P.R Shah, Shares & Stock Brokers (P) Ltd v. B.H.H Secu- rities (P) Ltd.
[(2012) 1 SCC 594).
OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd Page No.43 of 45
44. A perusal of the arbitral award shows that the arbitrator has examined all the relevant aspects of
the agreement, the corre- spondences made by the parties, the terms of the contract and the conduct
of the parties. He has remained inside the parameters of the contract and has construed the
provisions of the contract. The petitioner has failed to establish that the arbitrator has travelled
beyond the terms of the contract.

45. Having examined the various contentions of the petitioner on the touchstone of the parameters
of interference as explicitly laid down by the Supreme Court in several judgments referred to above,
I am of the view that the impugned Award does not suffer from any infirmity or error apparent on
the face of record. It is not for this Court to sit in appraisal of the evidence led before the learned
Arbitrator and this Court will not open itself to the task of being a judge on the evidence placed
before the Arbitrator which was subject matter of dispute. In the present case, the Arbitrator has
deliberated on the issues under reference which were within his competence and as per the
agreement entered into between the parties. There are no allegations against the Arbitrator of mis-
conduct nor of having misconducted the proceedings which have either been specifically alleged by
the petitioner or established. The Arbitrator has duly explained the reasons for arriving at his
decisions. There is nothing to indicate that award is in conflict with the basic notions of justice and
the fair play and OMP Comm No.42/19 Union of India Vs. Indian Agro Marketing Co−operative Ltd
Page No.44 of 45 fundamental policy of Indian law or in contravention of the terms of the
agreement or it lacks reasoning as pleaded in the petition.
46. For the aforesaid discussions, I am of the view that the im-
pugned award does not call for interference.
47. The petition is accordingly dismissed. Parties are left to bear their own costs.
48. File be consigned to record room.
