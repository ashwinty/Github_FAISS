CS(OS) No.2569/2000
1. This is a suit for recovery of Rs. 32,53,824/-
instituted by the Tata Finance Ltd. through its attorney Mr.
Anil Sharma. The plaintiff - company had taken flat No.
401, New Delhi, House 27, Barakhamba Road, New Delhi -
110 001 admeasuring 1076 sq. ft. and comprising of one
hall and a toilet on rent, from defendants 1 to 3 for a period
of three years vide registered lease deed executed on
18.04.1995. Vide another agreement of the same day,
defendant No.4 leased the furnishings and fittings provided
in the aforesaid premises to the plaintiff company, for the
same period. A sum of Rs.25,82,400/- was deposited by the
plaintiff company as security vide yet another agreement
executed between the plaintiff company and all the four
defendants on the same date.
2. Clause 17 of the lease agreement gave an option to
the plaintiff company to renew the lease for a further term of
three years by giving notice in writing, by registered post at
least six months before the expiry of the lease term, on the
same terms and conditions except that in case of renewal,
the rent was to increase 25% from the last paid rent. In
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 2 of 63
case of renewal, a fresh lease agreement was to be executed
on the stamp papers of appropriate value at the cost of the
plaintiff company. It was further stipulated in Clause 17 of
the lease agreement that the lessee would be entitled to
vacate the premises after giving a prior six English calendar
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 2Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
months notice during the initial or renewed lease term. On
expiry of six years, the lessee was to hand over vacant
possession of the premises to the lessor unless the lease
was renewed by execution of a fresh lease agreement. The
security deposit was to be refunded to the lessee without
any interest on the expiry of the said lease or the vacation of
the said premises by lessee, whichever is earlier, against
handing over peaceful vacant possession of the flat,
furnishings and fittings in good condition and after
deducting dues, if any.
3. The plaintiff company wrote a letter dated
07.10.1997 to the defendants exercising its option to renew
the initial lease which was to expire on 31.03.1998 for a
further period of three years, on payment of 25% higher rent
in terms of clause 17 of the lease deed. Similar letter was
issued by the plaintiff company with respect to furnishings
and fittings provided in the premises. However, vide letter
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 3 of 63
dated 16.12.1998, the plaintiff company claims to have
written to the defendants expressing its intention to vacate
the tenanted premises six months therefrom, in exercise of
its option to terminate the lease as per clause 17. Similar
notice was given to defendant No.4 with respect to
agreement for furnishings and fittings. However, vide
subsequent letters dated 14.5.1999 and 14.07.1999, the
plaintiff company sought extensions from the defendants to
continue to occupy the premises on a month to month basis
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 3Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
till 31.08.1999 on the ground that they had not been able to
remove all their furnitures etc. and shift to a new premises.
4. Vide letter dated 29th September, 1999, the
plaintiff company finally called upon the defendants to take
possession of the tenanted premises and collect keys
without any further delay. The defendants, according to the
plaintiff company, failed to take possession and also did not
refund the interest free security amount, which the plaintiff
company had deposited with them. By letter dated 4th May,
2000, the plaintiff demanded the security deposit of
Rs.25,82,400/- along with interest on that amount at the
rate of 24% per annum with effect from 30 th September,
1999. The amount of interest comes to Rs.6,71,424/-,
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 4 of 63
thereby making a total of Rs.32,53,824/-.
5. Defendant Nos. 2 to 4 have contested the suit and
have also filed a counter claim for recovery of
Rs.19,18,079/- from the plaintiff company. They have
denied the authority of Mr. Anil Sharma to institute the suit
on behalf of the plaintiff company. It has been claimed by
them that defendant No.1 had gifted his share in the
tenanted premises to defendant No.3 on 31st October, 1998
and the plaintiff was informed accordingly. On merits,
execution of registered lease deed dated 18th April, 1995 has
been admitted by the contesting defendants, who have
claimed that the lease deed as also the agreement with
respect to furnishing and fittings expired by efflux of time
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 4Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
on 31st March, 2001. The contesting defendants have denied
receipt of letters dated 16th December, 1998 and 14th May,
1999. They have, however, admitted receipt of letter dated
14th July, 1999 from the plaintiff company. They have also
claimed that the plaintiff company wrongly stopped
payment of rent with effect from September, 1999. The
receipt of plaintiff(cid:128)s letter dated 29th September, 1999 has
also been admitted by the contesting defendants. This is
also their case that no notice terminating the tenancy in
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 5 of 63
terms of Clause 17 of the lease agreement dated 18 th April,
1995 was given by the plaintiff company to them at any
point of time and, therefore, the lease expired only by efflux
of time on 31st March, 2001. The contesting defendants
have claimed rent at the rate of Rs.1,34,500/- per month for
the period from 1st September, 1999 to 31st March, 2001,
Rs.4,03,500/- towards damages for use and occupation at
the same rate for the period 1st April, 2001 to 31st June,
2001, Rs.48,984/- towards maintenance charges payable to
the Capital Maintenance Society, Rs.12,09,381/- towards
increase in property tax for the years 1995-96 to 2000-
2001, Rs.1,05,114/- towards charges for use of electricity
and water upto February, 2001 and Rs.18,000/- towards
ground rent and insurance for the period of 1 st April, 1995
to 31st March, 2001. They have also claimed Rs.1,60,000/-
towards interest at the rate of 18% per annum on the
balance amount after adjusting the security deposit. Thus,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 5Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
an amount of Rs.19,18,079/- has been claimed by the
defendants after deducting the security deposit of
Rs.25,82,400/-.
6. CS(OS) No.524/2004 has been filed by Shri P.S.
Mangla, Shri Kamal Mangla and Smt. Sneh Lata Mangla,
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 6 of 63
who are defendants No. 1 to 3 in CS(OS) No.2569/2010,
claiming possession of the aforesaid tenanted premises as
well as furnishing and fittings provided therein as also for
recovery of Rs.38,87,050/- towards damages for use and
occupation for the period from 1st July, 2001 to 30th April,
2004 at the rate of Rs.1,14,325/- per month, Rs.6,85,950/-
towards hire charges for the period from 1 st July, 2001 to
30th April, 2004 at the rate of Rs.20,175/- per month,
Rs.12,94,092/- towards increase in property tax for the
years 2000-01 to 2003-04, Rs.1,17,909/- towards
maintenance charges for the period from 1 st August, 2001 to
30th April, 2004 at the rate of Rs.3573/- per month and
Rs.9,250/- as ground rent and insurance for the period
from 1st April, 2001 to 30th April, 2004. They have also
claimed interest on the aforesaid amount at the rate of 12%
per annum amounting to Rs.10,19,022/- besides claiming
future damages for use and occupation as well as hire
charges for the future.
7. The defendant company in this suit, which is
plaintiff in CS(OS) No.2569/2000 has denied its liability
towards payment of damages for use and occupation, hire

charges, increase in house tax, maintenance charges,

not liable to pay any amount to the plaintiffs towards
increase in house tax.

ISSUE NO.1
9. PW-1 Mr. Pradeep Sehrawet, Regional Legal
Incharge of the plaintiff company identified the signatures of
Mr. Anil Sharma, Manager (Law) of the plaintiff company on
the plaint and verification clause and stated that he was
duly authorized to sign and institute the present suit vide
power of attorney executed in his favour on 26 th July, 2000.
The original power of attorney in favour of Mr. Anil Sharma
has not been filed by the plaintiff company though a
photocopy is available on record, having been filed on 8 th
September, 2003. The cross-examination of the witness,
however, shows that the original was not brought by him.
10. In Aktiebolaget Volvo and others v. R.
Venkatachalam and another (I.A. No.5683/2008 in
CS(OS) No.516/2007 decided by this Court on 18 th May,
2009), this Court held that since a photocopy or a copy
would also be a document and it cannot be said that the
provisions of the CPC for filing of documents necessarily
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 9 of 63
relate to original documents. Dealing with the question as
to whether under Order 13 Rule 1 of the CPC, the original
documents has to be placed on the file of the Court and
whether Evidence Act while providing for proof of
documents by primary evidence requires filing/placing of
the original document on the record of the Court, it was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 8Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
held that the legislative scheme permits production of
originals for inspection only and filing of copies only. It was
also held that endorsement/exhibit mark can also be put on
the copies of the court record as well.
11. A perusal of the photocopy filed by the plaintiff
shows that the power of attorney in favour of Mr. Anil
Sharma was attested by public notary on 26 th July, 2000.
Since the power of attorney in favour of Mr. Anil Sharma
purports to be attested by a Public Notary, there is a
statutory presumption under Section 85 of Evidence Act
that the Power of Attorney was executed by the person by
whom it purports to have been executed and the person
who executed the power of attorney was fully competent in
this regard. In Jugraj Singh and Anr. Vs. Jaswant Singh
and Ors., AIR 1971 SC 761, the Power of Attorney attested
by a Public Notary was disputed on the ground that it did
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 10 of 63
not show on its face that the Notary had satisfied himself
about the identity of the executant. Supreme Court held
that there was a presumption of regularity of official acts
and that the Notary must have satisfied himself in the
discharge of his duties that the person who was executing it
was the proper person. In Rajesh Wadhwa vs. Sushma
Govil, AIR 1989, Delhi 144, it was contended before this
Court that till it is proved that the person who signed the
said power of attorney was duly appointed attorney, the
court cannot draw a presumption under Section 57 and 85
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 9Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
of the Evidence Act. Repelling the contention, it was held by
this Court that the very purpose of drawing presumption
under Sections 57 and 85 of the Evidence Act would be
nullified if proof is to be had from the foreign country
whether a particular person who had attested the document
as a Notary Public of that country is in fact a duly appointed
Notary or not. When a seal of the Notary is put on the
document, Section 57 of the Evidence Act comes into play
and a presumption can be raised regarding the genuineness
of the seal of the said Notary, meaning thereby that the said
document is presumed to have been attested by a
competent Notary of that country. In Punjab National Bank
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 11 of 63
vs. Khajan Singh, AIR 2004 Punjab and Haryana 282, the
Power of Attorney in favour of a bank, which had been duly
attested, was rejected by the learned District Judge on the
ground that the presumption under Section 85 of Evidence
Act was available to a particular class of Power of Attorneys
described in the section, which was confined to its execution
and authenticity alone. The High Court, however, rejected
the view taken by the learned District Judge holding that
absence of proof of resolution authorizing the executant to
execute the Power of Attorney could not be sustained and a
presumption in favour of the attorney would arise under
Section 85 Act. Hence in this case also, the Court can
presume not only that the power of attorney dated 26 th July,
2000 was executed by Shri Dilip Sudhakar Pendse,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 10Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
Managing Director of the plaintiff company in favour of Shri
Anil Sharma, the then Manager (Law) of the plaintiff
company, it can be further presumed that Mr. Dilip
Sudhakar Pendse was duly authorized by the plaintiff
company to execute a power of attorney in favour of Mr. Anil
Sharma. Hence, it was not necessary for the plaintiff
company to produce the power of attorney executed by the
plaintiff company in favour of Mr. Dilip Sudhakar Pendse,
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 12 of 63
Managing Director of the plaintiff company.
In any case, since no arguments were advance on
behalf of the defendants in CS(OS) No.2569/2000 on this
issue, I need not dilate further and record a specific finding
on this issue.
ISSUE NO.2
12. There appears to be a typographical error in this
issue since the case of the plaintiff is that it was defendant
No.1, who had transferred his share in the tenanted
premises to defendant No.3. It appears that the word
defendant No.1 ought to have been typed in placed of
defendant No.3 in this issue.
13. In para 2 of the written statement, the contesting
defendants have specifically alleged that defendant No.1 had
gifted his share of the tenanted premises to defendant No.3
Sneh Lata Bansal on 31st October, 1998 and informed the
plaintiff about it vide letter dated 31st October, 1998 and 5th
November, 1998. It is further alleged that by these letters,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 11Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
defendant No.1 had advised the plaintiff company to pay the
rent of his share to defendant No.3. It is also alleged that
defendant No.1 had also written to the plaintiff company
that the security deposit had been transferred to defendant
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 13 of 63
No.3, who had undertaken to abide by all the terms and
conditions of the lease agreement. These averments have
not been specifically denied in para 2 of the
replication/written statement to the counter claim and,
therefore, are deemed to have been admitted. On the other
hand, the plaintiff company claimed that the alleged
transfer does not absolve defendant No.1 to refund the
security deposit paid to him thereby admitting the transfer
and claim by the contesting defendants. Exhibit DW2/1 is
the letter dated 31st October, 1998 written jointly by
defendant Nos. 1 and 3, Shri P.S. Mangla and Mrs. Sneh
Lata Mangla to the plaintiff company informing it that
defendant No.1 had gifted his 20% share in flat No.401, New
Delhi House to Mrs. Sneh Lata Mangla, who already held
20% share in the aforesaid flat and requested the plaintiff
company to pay future rent for the period commencing 1 st
November, 1998 to her. Exhibit DW2/2 is a letter dated 5th
November, 1998 from defendant Nos. 1 and 3 to the plaintiff
company requesting the plaintiff company to pay his share
in the rent to defendant No.3 Smt. Sneh Lata Mangla and
also informing that security deposit had also been
transferred to defendant No.3, who had undertaken to abide
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 12Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 14 of 63
by all the terms and conditions of the lease deed. In fact,
PW1, Mr. Pradeep Sehrawat has also admitted in para 9 of
his affidavit dated 31st May, 2006 that defendant No.1 had
informed the plaintiff company that he was gifting his
interest in the property to defendant Nos. 2 and 3 as a part
of his tax planning and the company had accordingly agreed
to remit the future rent to defendant Nos. 2 and 3. Since,
the rent with effect from 1st November, 1998 was required to
be paid only to defendant Nos. 2 and 3 and the security
deposit was also transferred to defendant No.3, the suit is
bad for misjoinder of defendant No.1, whose name is struck
off from the array of defendants in CS(OS) No.2569/2000.
ISSUE No.3
14. Clause 17 of the lease deed dated 18th April, 1994
reads as under:-
"On the expiry of the initial lease period
of three years the lessees shall have the
option to renew the lease for a further
term of 3 years by giving notice in writing
by Registered Post at least six months
before the expiry of this lease term on the
same terms and conditions except that
the lease amount for the renewed 3 years
term shall be increased by 25% of the last
lease amount paid. In case of renewal of
a fresh Lease Agreement will be executed
on the stamp paper of appropriate value
at Lessee(cid:128)s cost. It is however agreed that
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 15 of 63
the Lessee shall be entitled to vacate the
premises by giving a prior six English
calendar months notice during the initial
or renewed lease term. After the expiry of
six years period of 31st March, 2001, the
Lessee would handover peaceful vacant
possession of the demised premises to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 13Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
the Lessors, unless of course, the lease is
renewed further at mutually agreed terms
6 months prior to 31st March, 2001 by
execution of a fresh Lease Agreement."
15. In exercise of the option given to the plaintiff
company, a letter dated 7th October, 1997 was written by
the plaintiff company to defendant Nos. 1 to 3, giving a
notice exercising option to renew the lease agreement for
further period of 3 years from 1st April, 1998 on the same
terms and conditions except that the monthly rent to
increase by 25%. Similar notice was given to defendant
No.4 with respect to furnishing and fittings provided to the
plaintiff company and the same is Exhibit P-2. However,
admittedly no lease agreement was executed between the
parties despite exercise of option in this regard by the
plaintiff company.
16. Clause 17 of the lease deed dated 18th April, 1998
specifically stipulated that in case of renewal, a fresh lease
agreement would be executed on the stamp paper of
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 16 of 63
appropriate value at Lessee(cid:128)s cost. Even otherwise, a lease
for three years, even if it was a renewed lease in exercise of
an option given to the tenant under the original lease, could
be created only by execution and registration of an
instrument as required by Section 107 of the Transfer of
Property Act, which to the extent it is relevant, provides that
a lease of immovable property from year to year, or for any
term exceeding one year or reserving a yearly rent, can be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 14Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
made only by a registered instrument.
17. In Burmah Shell Oil Distributing now known as
Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. v. Khaja Midhat
Noor and Others, (1988) 3 SCC 44, the lease was
executed for a period of 10 years which expired on January
16, 1958. The lease could be renewed for a further period of
5 years. On considering the provisions of Sections 106 and
107 of the Transfer of Property Act, Supreme Court, inter
alia, observed as under:-
"In view of the para 1 of Section 107 of
the Act, since the lease was for a period
exceeding one year, it could only have
been extended by a registered instrument
executed by both the lessor and the
lessee. In the absence of registered
instrument, the lease shall be deemed to
be "lease from month to month". It is
clear from the very language of Section
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 17 of 63
107 of the Act which postulates that a
lease of immovable property from year to
year, or for any term exceeding one year,
or reserving a yearly rent, can be made
only by a registered instrument. In the
absence of registered instrument, it must
be a monthly lease."
Hence, in the absence of a registered lease deed,
the lease dated 18th April, 1995 did not get renewed for a
further period of 3 years and expired by efflux of time on
31st March, 1998.
18. It is, however, an admitted case that even after
expiry of the lease deed dated 18th April, 1995 by efflux of
time on 31st March, 1998, the tenant continued to occupy
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 15Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
the tenancy premises and the landlords continued to accept
rent from the tenant.
19. Section 116 of Transfer of Property Act, to the
extent it is relevant, provides that if a lessee remains in
possession of the tenanted premises after the determination
of the lease granted to him, and the lessor or his legal
representative accepts rent from the lessee, or otherwise
assents to his continuing in possession, the lease is, in the
absence of an agreement to the contrary, renewed from year
to year, or from month to month, according to the purpose
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 18 of 63
for which the property is leased, as specified in Section 106.
Section 106 of Transfer of Property Act, to the extent it is
relevant, provides that in the absence of a contract or local
law or usage to the contrary, a lease of immoveable property
for other than agricultural or manufacturing purposes shall
be deemed to be a lease from month to month, terminable,
on the part of either lessor or lessee, by fifteen days' notice.
Therefore, since the defendants allowed the plaintiff to
continue in possession of the tenancy premises and also
accepted rent from it, even after the term of the lease had
expired by afflux of time, the lease came to be renewed from
month to month being a lease for commercial purpose.
In Bhawanji Lakhamshi and others v. Himatlal
Jamnadas Dani and others, (1972) 1 SCC 388, Supreme
Court observed as under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 16Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
"The act of holding over after the
expiration of the term does not create a
tenancy of any kind. If a tenant remains
in possession after the determination of
the lease, the common law rule is that he
is a tenant on sufferance. A distinction
should be drawn between a tenant
continuing in possession after the
determination of the term with the
consent of the landlord and a tenant
doing so without his consent. The former
is a tenant at sufferance in English Law
and the latter a tenant holding over or a
tenant at will. In view of the concluding
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 19 of 63
words of Section 116 of the Transfer of
Property Act, a lessee holding over is in a
better position than a tenant at will. The
assent of the landlord to the continuance
of possession after the determination of
the tenancy will create a new tenancy.
What the section contemplates is that on
one side there should be an offer of
taking a new lease evidenced by the
lessee or sub-lessee remaining in
possession of the property after his term
was over and on the other side there
must be a definite consent to the
continuance of possession by the
landlord expressed by acceptance of rent
or otherwise."
The Court also referred to the following
observations made by Patanjali Sastri, J. in Kai Khushroo
Bezonjee Capadia (supra) :-
"Turning now to the main point, it will be
seen that the section postulates the
lessee remaining in possession after the
determination of the lease which is
conduct indicative, in ordinary
circumstances, of his desire to continue
as a tenant under the lessor and implies
a tacit offer to take a new tenancy from
the expiration of the old on the same
terms so far as they are applicable to the
new situation, and when the lessor
assents to the lessee so continuing in
possession, he tacitly accepts the latter(cid:128)s
offer and a fresh tenancy results by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 17Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
implied agreement of the parties. When,
further, the lessee in that situation
tenders rent and the lessor accepts it,
their conduct raises more readily and
clearly the implication of an agreement
between the parties to create a fresh
tenancy."
In the case before this Court, since the plaintiff
company, on expiry of the lease by efflux of time on 31 st
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 20 of 63
March, 1998, continued in possession with the consent of
the landlords, it became „a tenant holding over(cid:128) the tenanted
premises, and is not a „tenant at sufferance(cid:128).
20. The next question which comes for consideration is
as to whether the tenancy could have been determined by
the plaintiff company by giving 15 days notice in terms of
Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act or it was
required to give six months notice in terms of Clause 17 of
the lease deed dated 18th April, 1995.
It was contended by the learned counsel for the
defendants that since the provisions of Section 106(1) of the
Transfer of Property Act providing for termination of tenancy
for any purpose other than agricultural or manufacturing
purposes by giving 15 days notice apply only in the absence
of a contract to the contrary, and since clause 17 of the
lease agreement dated 18 th April, 1995, which is a contract
between the parties, provides for six English Calendar
Month(cid:128)s notice and no such notice was ever given by the
plaintiff, the tenancy was not validly terminated.
21. In Burma Shell Oil Storage and Distributing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 18Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
Co. of India Ltd. v. State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1984
Allahabad 89, the following question of law was referred
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 21 of 63
for the opinion of the Full Bench:-
"Whether, for the purposes of Section 116
of Transfer of Property Act, it was
necessary that there should be a contract
subsequent to the termination of the
original lease regarding the period of
notice required under Section 106, P.T.
Act."
During the course of the judgment, the Full Bench noted
that a Division Bench of that Court in an earlier decision in
Suiti Devi v. Banarsidas Bhagwan-das, AIR 1949
Allahabad 703, had taken a view that the contract
regarding the period of notice could also be earlier to the
termination of the lease and had, to ascertain the period of
notice, looked into the original contract between the parties.
It was further noted that another Division Bench of that
High Court in Radha Ballabh v. Bahore Ram Chand, AIR
1955 Allahabad 679 had clearly laid down that the
contract regarding the period of tenancy could be either in
the original lease deed itself or could be arrived at between
the parties after the extermination of the original lease. It
also took note of an earlier decision of its Full Bench in Shiv
Nath v. Shri Ram Bharosey Lal, AIR 1969 Allahabad
333 wherein the above referred two decisions were approved
and a decision of Oudh High Court holding that where a
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 22 of 63
new tenancy is created by reason of the landlord allowing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 19Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
the tenant to hold over after termination of the original lease
deed then in the absence of any terms in respect of the new
tenancy, the terms governing the original lease deemed to
have been accepted by the parties. The Full Bench was of
the view that the decision of another Division Bench of the
Court in Zahoor Ahmad Abdul Sattar v. State of U.P.,
AIR 1965 Allahabad 326 was also to the same effect that
renewal of lease under Section 116 of the Transfer of
Property Act would be on the same terms as the original
lease except that it would be a lease from year to year or
from month to month according to the nature of the
tenancy, the other conditions remaining the same. The
question referred to the Full Bench was answered holding
that it is not necessary that there should be a contract
subsequent to the termination of the original lease regarding
the period of notice required under Section 116 of the
Transfer of Property Act and that the contract could be
either in the original lease or could be arrived at between
the parties after termination of the original lease. This was
also the view taken by the Calcutta High Court in Krishna
Char an Sukladas vs. Nitya Sundari Devi, AIR 1926
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 23 of 63
Calcutta 1239 and by Madras High Court in K.
Gnanadesikam Pillai and Ors. vs. Antony Benathu
Boopalarayar, AIR 1934 Madras 458. It would also be
pertinent to note here that the decision of the Allahabad
High Court in the case of Zahoor Ahmad (supra) was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 20Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
affirmed by the Supreme Court in State of U.P. v. Zahoor
Ahmad and another, AIR 1973 SC 2520 though the issue
as to whether the agreement envisaged in Section 116 of the
Transfer of Property Act had necessarily to be post
termination of tenancy or could also be an earlier agreement
was not examined by Supreme Court.
The following was the view of the Federal Court in
Kai Khushroo Bezonjee Capadia v. Bai Jerbai Hirjibhoy
Warden and Another, AIR 1949 (50) FC 124, where the
Court agreed with the following statement contained in
Woodfall(cid:128)s "Law of Landlord and Tenant"
"Where a tenant for a term of years holds
over after the expiration of his lease he
becomes a tenant on sufferance, but
when he pays or expressly agrees to pay
any subsequent rent at the previous rate
a new tenancy from year to year is
thereby created upon the same terms and
conditions as those contained in the
expired lease so far as the same are
applicable to and not inconsistent with
an yearly tenancy."
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 24 of 63
22. However, this issue also came to be considered by
a Full Bench of this Court in Mrs. Daman Kaur Sethi and
others v. Indian Bank (Suit No.2075/1999 decided on 31st
January, 2002). In that case, the plaintiffs before the Court
had let out premises to the defendant bank by way of
registered lease deed for a period of 5 years, which expired
on 13th February, 1994. The lease could be renewed at the
option of the defendant bank for the further period of four
years by enhancing the rent by 15%. The defendant bank
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 21Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
started paying rent to the plaintiffs at the enhanced rate
though no lease deed was got registered. The plaintiffs
terminated the tenancy of the defendant bank by 15 days
notice. Relying upon a clause in the lease deed providing
for termination of the tenancy only by serving a six months(cid:128)
notice, it was contended on behalf of the defendant bank
that 15 days notice issued by the plaintiff to them was not a
valid notice. The contention of the plaintiffs, however, was
that on expiry of the period of lease, a month to month
tenancy came into being, which could be terminated by 15
days notice as provided in Section 106 of the Transfer of
Property Act. The contention on behalf of the bank was that
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 25 of 63
since the period of notice terminating the tenancy as
stipulated in Section 106 of Transfer of Property Act is
subject to an agreement to the contrary and the lease deed
dated 27th January, 1989 contained a requirement for six
months(cid:128) notice to be served by the tenant, the notice dated
28th May, 1999 terminating the monthly tenancy from 13th
July, 1999 must be held to be bad in law. It was also
contended that the mode of termination provided in the
registered deed of lease remains applicable even in the case
where the tenant continues to be in possession of the
tenanted premises as a tenant holding over in terms of
Section of 116 of the Transfer of Property Act. Rejecting the
contention of the defendant bank, the Full Bench, inter alia,
held as under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 22Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
"The expression „agreement to the
contrary(cid:128), used in Section 116 is referable
to the terms of the tenant holding over
and not to the terms of the original lease.
In the absence of any agreement to
contrary statutory tenancy created under
Section 116 has to be invariably
determined in accordance with Section
106 (See Rayappa Basappa Killed v. The
Land Tribunal and others, AIR 1976
Karnataka 205."
"The parties, however, in this case
proceeded on the basis that the
defendant became a tenant holding over.
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 26 of 63
In such a situation, in our opinion, the
lease becomes month to month lease, as
the nature of tenancy in terms of Section
106 is directly relatable to the purpose for
which a lease has been granted. Where
the period of lease, as specified in the
registered instrument, comes to an end,
the lease itself comes to an end.
Subsequent lease must, therefore, be in
terms of the provisions contained in
Section 107 of the Transfer of Property
Act. The purported agreement of lease
not being a registered one the same
having been made in contravention of
Section 107 as also Section 17(1) (d) of
the Indian Registration Act, it having
regarding to the purpose mentioned in
Section 106 must be held to be a month
to month lease. The stipulation as
regards the service of six-months(cid:128) notice
for termination of tenancy as embodied in
the original lease deed cannot have an
application after the same came to an
end."
23. Regarding the decision of the Full Bench of the
Allahabad High Court in Burma Shell Oil Storage and
Distributing Co. of India Ltd. (supra), the Full Bench of
this Court, inter alia, observed as under:-
"We may now consider the
decision cited by Mr. Nayyar. A Full
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 23Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
Bench of Allahabad High Court in
Burmah Shell Oil Storage and
distributing Co of India Ltd v. State of
Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1984 Allahabad 89,
proceeded on the basis that the term of
the new lease would be the same as of old
lease, except the conditions of the original
lease as to the period of the lease. With
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 27 of 63
utmost respect to the learned Judges, we
cannot subscribe to the said view. If an
indenture of lease comes to an end by
efflux of time the terms and conditions of
the said lease do not subsist. The terms
and conditions embodied in a deed of
lease perish with it. Renewal being a
fresh grant, the terms and conditions
thereof either must refer to the original
lease or fresh terms and conditions must
be agreed to by the parties. In the
instant case, admittedly an unregistered
agreement of lease was executed. It is
not the case of the defendant that service
of six months(cid:128) notice for terminating the
tenancy was also stipulated therein. In
any event, the said agreement of tenancy
being an unregistered one, the same
would not be admissible in evidence
being for the purpose of relevance on the
terms and conditions thereof. In terms of
Section 116 also the lease becomes
month to month one. As such for the
said purpose, service of 15 days(cid:128) notice
terminating the tenancy with the expiry
of the tenancy month would meet the
requirement of law."
In view of the above referred decision of the Full
Bench of this Court, I hold that the tenancy of the plaintiff
company could have been determined by giving 15 days
notice in accordance with Section 106 of the Transfer of
Property Act.
24. In the case before this Court, the case of the
plaintiff is that it had determined the lease agreement vide
notice dated 16th December, 1998, which is exhibit PW1/1
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 24Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 28 of 63
and purports to have been received by one T. Ramani on
behalf of Shri P.S. Mangla and others on 21st December,
1998.
25. The letter Exhibit PW1/1 purports to have been
received by Mr. T. Ramani on behalf of the defendants. The
case of the defendants is that Mr. T. Ramani was not their
agent and was not authorized to receive this letter on their
behalf. Mr. T. Ramani happens to be an attesting witness to
the lease deed dated 18th April, 1995. The case of the
plaintiff company is that Mr. Ramani was brought by the
defendants to witness the lease deed. Assuming that Mr.
Ramani had witnessed the lease deed on the request of the
defendants, that by itself did not make him an agent of the
defendants nor did that authorize him to receive letters on
behalf of the defendants. Therefore, receipt of this letter by
Mr. T. Ramani does not amount to receipt by the
defendants. It would be pertinent to note here that Mr.
Ramani has not been produced in the witness box to prove
that he had received the letters Exhibit PW1/1 and Exhibit
PW1/2from the plaintiff company and that he was acting as
an agent of the defendants while receiving this document
from the plaintiff company.
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 29 of 63
26. This is also the plaintiff(cid:128)s own case that vide letters
dated 14th May, 1999, Exhibit PW1/3 and Exhibit PW1/4, it
had sought extension upto 31st July, 1999 to vacate the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 25Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
tenanted premises and vide letters dated 14th July, 1999,
which are Exhibits P-3 and P-4 had sought extension of
time upto 31st August, 1999 to vacate the tenanted
premises.
27. Exhibit P-3 is the letter sent by the plaintiff
company to the defendants on 14th July, 1999 referring to
its earlier letters dated 16th December, 1998 and 14th May,
1999 regarding termination of the lease agreement and
handing over possession of the tenanted premises and
seeking extension upto 31st August, 1999 for vacating the
premises. This letter was received by the defendants on or
before 3rd August, 1999 as is evident from letter Exhibit P-5,
which contains a reference to this letter and is an admitted
document. Vide letter dated 29th September, 1999 (Exhibit
PW1/5), informing them that despite their telephonic
messages since 27th September, 1999 to take possession of
the tenanted premises, no one from their side had come
forward to collect the keys, they conveyed to the defendants
that they would not be liable to pay rent after 30 th
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 30 of 63
September, 1999 and they should take possession of the
tenanted premises and refund the security deposit lying
with them. In my view, the letter dated 14th July, 1999 can,
in the facts and circumstances of the case, be safely taken
as a notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act
terminating, with effect from 31st August, 1999, the month
to month tenancy, which was created by the plaintiff
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 26Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
continuing in possession even after expiry of tenancy by
efflux of time on 31st March, 1998 and acceptance of rent by
the defendants from the plaintiff. In this regard, it would be
useful to refer to the provisions of sub-Section 3 of Section
106 of the Transfer of Property Act, which provides that a
notice under sub-section (1) shall not be deemed to be
invalid merely because the period mentioned therein falls
short of the period specified under that sub-section, where a
suit or proceeding is filed after the expiry of the period
mentioned in that sub-section.
In Bhagabandas Agarwalla v. Bhagwandas
Kanu and others, (1977) 2 SCC 646, SupremeCourt held
that a notice to quit must be constructed not with a desire
to find faults in it, which would render it defective, but it
must be construed ut res magis valeat quam pereat and not
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 31 of 63
with a desire to find faults in it. It was further observed
that the notice should not be read in a hyper-critical
manner but must be constructed in a common sense way.
The purpose of giving notice of termination of
tenancy by a tenant to the landlord is to make it known to
him that he does not propose to continue in possession of
the tenanted premises after the date from which the tenancy
is being terminated by him, so that the landlord is not taken
by surprise and gets adequate time to take possession of the
tenanted premises and to look for another tenant in case he
wants to let it out to another person. The letter dated 14 th
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 27Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
July, 1999 meets all the necessary requirements of a notice
of termination of tenancy. Vide this letter, the plaintiff
company expressed an unequivocal intention not to
continue in occupation of the tenanted premises after 31 st
August, 1999, it gave more than 15 days time to the
defendants to take possession and the date stipulated in
this letter for vacating the premises also expired by the end
of the month. Adopting a pragmatic and constructive
approach to interpretation of such notices, I am of the
considered view that this letter amounts to a valid notice of
termination of notice on the part of the plaintiff company.
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 32 of 63
The month to month tenancy, therefore, stood
terminated with effect from 31st August, 1999. The issue is
decided accordingly.
ISSUE NO.6,7 & 10.
Rent
28. Vide letter dated 29th September, 1999, which is
Exhibit PW1/5, the plaintiff company wrote to defendant
No.1 Shri P.S. Mangla requesting him to take possession of
the tenanted premises and informing him that they would
not be liable to pay any rent after 30 th September, 1999.
The receipt of the letter dated 29th September, 1999 (Exhibit
PW1/5) has not been disputed by the defendants. As noted
earlier, receipt of this letter by the defendant on 6 th October,
1999 has been acknowledged in their letter dated 11 th
October, 1999, which is Exhibit P-6. Earlier on receipt of a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 28Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
letter dated 14th July, 1999 from the plaintiff company,
defendant No.1 Shri P.S. Mangla had written a letter dated
3rd August, 1999 to Mr. B.A. Suvarna, Executive Director
(Legal) of the plaintiff company acknowledging the receipt of
the letter dated 14th July, 1999. It is quite obvious from a
bare perusal of this letter that the defendants wanted the
plaintiff company to continue occupying the tenanted
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 33 of 63
premises and wanted it to reconsider its decision to vacate
the premises by 31st August, 1999. On receipt of the letter
dated 29th September, 1999, defendant Kamal Mangla
referring to Clause 17 of the lease deed informed the
plaintiff company that no notice of vacating the flat as per
aforesaid clause of the lease deed had been received by
them and if the plaintiff company had decided to vacate the
flat, they should do the needful in terms of Clause 17 of the
lease deed and in the meantime continue to pay monthly
rent during the notice period. Thus, the stand taken by the
defendants was that the plaintiff company was required to
give six months(cid:128) notice to them before vacating the tenanted
premises. The case of the plaintiff company is that despite
their having written various letters to the defendants
requiring them to take possession of the tenanted premises,
the defendants failed to take possession from them and,
therefore, they are not liable to pay rent for the period
subsequent to September, 1999. As noted earlier, the plea
taken by the defendants on receipt of the letter dated 29 th
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 29Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
September, 1999 was that the plaintiff company was
required to serve six months(cid:128) notice and keep on paying rent
to them during notice period. The stand taken by the
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 34 of 63
defendants was not in accordance with law as held by me
while deciding the issue No.3. Therefore, the defendants
could not have insisted on six months(cid:128) notice being given to
them by the plaintiff company as a precondition to take
possession of the tenanted premises. On receipt of the
letter dated 29th September, 1999 from the plaintiff
company, the defendants ought to have gone to the office of
the plaintiff company and taken possession of the tenanted
premises from them. They, however, failed to take
possession despite willingness of the plaintiff company in
this regard. Vide letter dated 19th February, 2000 (Exhibit
P-7), defendants Kamal Mangla and Sneh Lata Mangla
wrote to the plaintiff company that they had come to take
possession but the possession was not given to them.
However, the letter does not indicate the day on which they
had gone to take possession nor does it indicate the place
where they had gone and the person to whom they had met.
In the natural course of human conduct, if the tenant
despite offering possession to the landlords refuses to
deliver possession to them, the landlords would immediately
write to him specifying the day as well as the time they
approached the tenant to take possession, the person whom
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 35 of 63
they met and the exact response of that person to their
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 30Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
request to hand over possession to them. It has come in the
testimony of the witnesses of the plaintiff that the plaintiff
company had vacated the tenanted premises and started
functioning at the new premises with effect from 1 st
September, 1999. The plaintiff company also published an
advertisement in „Hindustan Times(cid:128) New Delhi on 27 th
August, 1999 informing the public at large that from 31 st
August, 1999, they were consolidating their regional office
under one roof and were shifting from 3 rd and 4th floor of
New Delhi House, Barakhamba Road, New Delhi to 4th
Floor, Kanchenjunga Building, 18, Barakhamba Road, New
Delhi. The plaintiff company, therefore, had no incentive to
continue to hold possession of the tenanted premises and
thereby incur liability towards payment of rent and other
charges, when it was no more using those premises. It
would be pertinent to note here that there is no evidence to
prove that the plaintiff company was actually carrying out
any activity in the tenanted premises after September, 1999.
PW-3 Vaideghi Sreedharan, who was employed as a
receptionist with the plaintiff company at the relevant time,
has specifically stated in her affidavit that the branch office
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 36 of 63
was functioning from Flat No.401, New Delhi House, 27,
Barakhamba Road, New Delhi till 31st August, 1999 and
thereafter the plaintiff company had completely vacated the
aforesaid premises and shifted the entire branch office to
new premises at Kanchenjunga Building, 4 th Floor, 18,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 31Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
Barakhamba Road, New Delhi-110001 with effect from 1st
September, 1999. In fact, according to her, she on the
instructions of Assistant General Manager of the plaintiff
company contacted the defendants a number of time on
telephone and requested them to come and take keys and
possession of the tenanted premises. She claims to have
spoken to P.S. Mangla and Kamal Mangla several times in
this regard and, according to her, both of them were evasive
in their replies on this issue and did not agree to take back
the keys and possession of the premises. According to her,
Mr. Kamal Mangla had gone to the extent of shouting on her
on telephone and telling her that they would talk only to
Ratan Tata on the issue. PW-4, Ram Kumar Tiwari, is an
executive with the plaintiff company. He also stated that
the plaintiff company had completely vacated the tenanted
premises and shifted to Kanchenjunga Building with effect
from 1st September, 1999. No positive evidence has been
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 37 of 63
led by the defendants to controvert the deposition of these
witnesses and to prove that the plaintiff company continued
to carry on business from the tenanted premises even after
September, 1999. I, therefore, have not hesitation in
holding that the plaintiff company was not using the
tenanted premises after September, 1999, it had offered
possession to the defendants and the defendants, who were
insisting on six months(cid:128) notice, were not willing to take
possession.

29. In ICRA Ltd. v. Associated Journals Limited
and another, 2007 (98) DRJ 638, the lessee by its letter
dated 18th November, 1997 sent a notice of termination with
effect from 19th November, 1997 calling upon the
landlords/defendants to take possession of the tenanted
premises and refund the security deposit after deducting the
rent of previous three months along with stipulated interest.
Vide reply dated 22nd November, 1997, the defendants
requested the plaintiff for a rethinking in the matter. This
letter was followed by several reminders. On 16 th April,
1998, the lessee communicated to the lessor that it had
shifted to new building and was no longer in possession of
the tenanted premises. In reply, the landlord claimed that
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 38 of 63
delivery of vacant possession of the tenanted premises was a
condition precedent to the refund of the security deposit.
The case of the plaintiff, however, was that constructive
possession was handed over by them to the defendants with
the determination of the lease and actual possession was
subject to reciprocal arrangement on the part of the
defendants to refund the amount of the security deposit
along with stipulated interest. As per the agreement
between the parties, the security was interest free and was
refundable on determination/termination of the lease.
Since the defendants/landlords failed to refund the security
amount, the plaintiff/tenant filed a suit seeking recovery of
the amount of security along with interest, after adjustment
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 33Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
of rent payable by them. The defendants filed a counter
claim claiming that determination of the lease was not in
accordance with the agreement since the plaintiff continued
to be in possession of the demised premises and without
giving possession, the notice stood withdrawn/waived and
hence no claim for refund of balance security amount was
made out. This was also the case of the defendants that
they had come into possession of the tenanted premises
only on plaintiff(cid:128)s delivering the keys to them on 7 th
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 39 of 63
December, 1998. On receipt of letter dated 18 th April, 1998
from the defendants, the plaintiff reiterated its willingness
to give actual possession on receipt of the refund of the
security deposit. The factual position which emerged from
the correspondence between the parties was that the
plaintiff/tenant had terminated the lease, and had called
upon the defendants/landlords to take possession of the
tenanted premises and refund the balance security.
Accepting the plea taken by the plaintiff/tenant, this Court
held that the offer to vacant possession of the demised
premises having been made by the plaintiff company, it was
the duty of the defendants thereafter to act on the same and
take possession after notice of termination of the lease.
Regarding handing over of possession of the tenanted
premises, this Court held that constructive possession was
handed over to the defendants by the plaintiff by making an
offer to take over actual possession on payment of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 34Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
balance security deposit, which was sufficient to fulfill the
requirement of the lease agreement between the parties.
Decreeing the suit filed by the tenant, this Court, inter alia,
held as under:-
21. Taking into consideration the
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 40 of 63
aforesaid, I am of the view that when
possession of the tenanted premises is
offered upon termination of the lease, the
landlord/Lessor must act upon the same
and cannot refuse to take the possession.
If the Lessor/landlord refuses to take the
possession or act upon the offer being
made, the lease would not continue and
therefore the contention of the defendant
that the plaintiff had been in continued
possession of the demised premises
making him liable to pay the rent for the
same would not stand. In such a case,
the plaintiff who has done the needful on
this part is left with no other option but
to remain in possession of the said
premises."
30. In Onida Finance Ltd. v. Mrs. Malini Khanna,
2002 III AD (Delhi) 231, the security deposit, which was
equivalent to six months(cid:128) rent, was refundable to tenant on
expiry or termination of the lease. The plaintiff terminated
the lease vide notice dated 18 th January, 1997, with effect
from 14th February, 1997 and called upon the defendant to
return the security amount as also the amount of advance
rent. The landlord was also intimated that the tenanted
premises would remain vacant at her risk and the plaintiff
shall not be liable to pay any rent from the date the tenancy
stood terminated. The contention of the defendant before
the Court was that mere offer to surrender possession was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 35Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
of no consequence unless actual physical possession was
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 41 of 63
delivered to her. Rejecting the contention, this Court, inter
alia, held as under:-
"28. It is trite that when the lease is
terminated by notice and the possession
is offered, the landlord cannot refuse to
take the possession. If the landlord
refuses to take the possession, the lease
would not continue. Therefore, even if the
contention of the defendant herein was
that the tenancy was for a period three
years, she could take possession and
thereafter sued the plaintiff for rent. She
did not do so. She took calculate risk by
challenging the action of the plaintiff in
terminating the tenancy and avoided to
take possession."
31. In The Calcutta Credit Corporation Ltd., &
another v. Happy Homes (P) Ltd., AIR 1968 SC 471, the
written lease was for a period of 12 years commencing 1 st
January, 1939. On expiry of the term of the lease, the
tenant continued to hold over the premises. A notice was
served on the landlords intimating the intention of the
tenant to vacate the premises on 31st August, 1953 and the
landlord was requested to arrange to take delivery of
possession. However, vide subsequent letter dated 26th
August, 1953, the tenant informed the landlord that they
did not intend to vacate the premises as originally intimated
and their notice may be treated as cancelled. The tenant
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 42 of 63
continued to be in possession and later sub-let a part of the
premises. The landlord then sued the sub-tenant for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 36Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
possession of the premises. The suit was resisted on the
ground that the tenancy of Allen Berry and Company Ltd.
(the tenant) had not been determined before they sub-let the
premises. Supreme Court rejected the contention of the
landlords that in order to determine the tenancy under the
Transfer of Property Act at the instance of the tenant,
means there must be actual delivery of possession before
the tenancy is effectively determined. The Court found the
contention to be contrary to the provisions of Section 111(h)
of the Transfer of Property Act, which, inter alia, provides
that a lease of immovable property demines on the expiry of
a notice to determine the lease, or to quit, or of intention to
quit, the property leased, duly given by one party to the
other.
32. The learned counsel for the defendants has
referred to Uberoisons (Machines) Ltd. v. Samtel Color
Ltd., 105 (2003) DLT 383 and Tamil Nadu Handloom
Weavers' Co-operative Society v. Harbans Lal Gupta,
2009 (107) DRJ 418 (DB). In Uberoisons (Machines)
Ltd.(supra) the parties entered into a lease agreement for a
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 43 of 63
period of 3 years. The lessee had deposited an interest free
security with the lessor, which was to be refunded at the
time of vacation of the premises and handing over
possession thereof along with fittings and fixtures in the
same condition as received from the landlord. Lessor,
however, was not entitled to deduct/adjust the amount of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 37Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
security towards dues of rent. On expiry of the term of the
lease or its earlier determination, the lessee was required to
hand over vacant possession of the demised premises to the
lessor in good condition against refund of the security
deposit. The defendant/lessee gave notice to the plaintiff,
expressing intention to vacate the demised premises on
completion of 3 months. When the authorized
representative of the plaintiff/lessor went to take possession
and for settlement of accounts, it transpired that the
demised premises had not been brought back to the original
condition in which the same was let out. The
plaintiff/lessor wrote to the defendant/lessee emphasizing
that he would be liable to pay rent till vacant possession of
the tenanted premises was given to him. The defendant, in
reply to the letter of the plaintiff, called him upon to pay the
amount of security and take vacant possession. An
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 44 of 63
estimated cost of repairs was also conveyed by the lessor to
the lessee. The defendant, thereafter, informed the plaintiff
that repairs had been carried out and, therefore, possession
be taken after settling the accounts. Simultaneously, he
also sent legal notice to the plaintiff/lessor intimating that
possession be taken on or before the date stipulated in the
notice and the advance and security deposit be refunded.
The plaintiff informed the defendant that the security had
been forfeited and lease cancelled as arrears of rent for more
than 2 months had not been paid. The defendant/lessee
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 38Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
was called upon to pay arrears after adjusting advance rent
and handing over possession within 3 days. The defendant,
however, did not comply with the notice. By the time, this
suit filed by lessor for possession, arrears of rent, mesne
profit and damages came up for final adjudication, the only
question which remained to be decided was that with
respect to entitlement of the plaintiff to arrears of rent,
mesne profits and damages. The plaintiff wanted arrears of
rent upto the date to which the possession was retained by
the defendant. The contention of the defendant on the other
hand was that he had always been ready and willing to
hand over possession of the premises but in view of the
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 45 of 63
attitude adopted by the plaintiff in not refunding the
security amount, did not hand over possession and,
therefore, was not obliged to pay rent. Rejecting the
contention of the defendant, this Court, inter alia, held as
under:-
"12. Now the question arises whether the
tenant could have retained the
possession of the premises without
paying the rent thereof on account of
non-refund of security amount by the
plaintiff. The answer is emphatic `no'. The
tenant has an independent remedy to
recover the security but in no way can
retain the possession of the premises on
the plea that until and unless security is
refunded, possession will not be handed
over. Such a possession by the tenant is
a possession for which he has to pay the
rent as the premises could not have been
put in use by the landlord nor have been
let out by the plaintiff. No tenant can take
the defense that he is entitled to retain
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 39Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
the possession of the premises unless
security amount is refunded to him.
When there is an independent remedy to
recover this amount, the retention of
possession cannot be justified. In order to
avoid the liability of rent, the tenant has
the obligation to handover the
possession. It is immaterial whether
premises was put into use by the
defendant/tenant or not. What is
material was whether possession is
retained by him or not."
33. In Tamil Nadu Handloom Weavers' Co-operative
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 46 of 63
Society (supra) the lease granted for six years was
terminable by 3 months(cid:128) notice. The plaintiff/tenant
terminated the lease with effect from 31st March, 1997 and
demanded the amount of security, he had deposited with
the lessor. One of the isues which came up for
consideration before the Division Bench of this Court in that
case was as to whether the plaintiff had validly terminated
the lease of the subject premises. Relying upon the decision
of the Rajasthan High Court in Raja Laksman Singh v.
State, AIR 1988 Rajasthan 44, this Court, inter alia, held
as under:-
"21. The law with respect to the
termination of lease by the tenant is well
settled. Where the tenant vacates the
tenancy premises and notifies the
landlord to take the delivery of
possession, the lease comes to an end.
The refusal of the landlord to accept the
possession will amount to delivery of
possession and the possession shall be
deemed to have been delivered to the
landlord though the landlord may not
accept the same..."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 40Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
The Court was of the view that the plaintiff had
validly terminated the lease with effect from 31 st March,
1997 by issuing notice of termination, which was duly
received by the defendant. As regard the liability of the
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 47 of 63
tenant to pay rent, the Court noticed that the plaintiff was
insisting on refund of security deposit but was not ready to
deliver the possession without taking back the security
deposit. The Court upheld the decision of the trial Court
that in such circumstances, the tenant was liable to pay
rent upto 30th April, 1997 when possession was delivered to
the defendant through a Local Commissioner.
However, neither of these two judgments apply to
the facts of the case before this Court, since there is no
evidence or even allegation that the plaintiff company was
insisting on refund of the security deposit before handing
over possession of the tenanted premises to the defendant
though, vide letter dated 16th December, 1998 (Exhibit
PW1/1 and PW1/2) terminating the tenancy with effect from
15th June, 1999, receipt of which has been denied by the
defendants, the plaintiff had requested the defendants to
take possession against refund of security deposit. While
writing the letter dated 29th September, 1999, the plaintiff
company did not insist of refund of the security deposit as a
pre-condition of handing over possession to defendant
though it did demand the refund of security lying with the
defendants. This is not the case of the defendants that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 41Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 48 of 63
when they went to take possession of the tenanted
premises, the plaintiff company refused to hand over
possession to them on the ground that the security deposit
had not been refunded to it. There is no averment to this
effect even in the letter dated 19th February, 2000 (Exhibit
P-7) written by them to the plaintiff company. Seeking
refund of the security while asking the lessor to take
possession of the tenanted premises is altogether different
from insisting upon payment of security deposit before
handing over possession of the tenanted premises. Had the
plaintiff company insisted on refund of the security deposit
before handing over possession of the tenanted premises to
the defendants, it would certainly have been liable to pay
rent to the defendants till the time possession was actually
delivered to them but, the evidence on record does not make
out any such insistence on the part of the plaintiff company.
In fact, since the security deposit agreement (Exhibit P-11)
with respect to security deposit provided that the security
would be refundable on expiry of the lease or on vacation of
the premises by the lessee, whichever be earlier against
handing over peaceful vacant possession of the flat,
furnishing and fittings in good conditions and after
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 49 of 63
deducting dues, if any, the plaintiff company, in my view,
could have insisted on simultaneously refund of the security
deposit while handing over possession of the tenanted
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 42Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
premises to the defendant, though it could not have insisted
on the security being refunded to it before handing over
possession to the defendant. In fact, the evidence on record
does not indicate even that the plaintiff company was
insisting on refund of the security simultaneous with
handing over possession to the defendants.
It transpired during arguments that rent upto
September, 1999 stands paid to the defendants. In view of
the above discussion, I hold that the plaintiff company was
not required to pay rent after September, 1999.
Electricity & Water Charges
The defendants in CS(OS) No.2569/2000 have
claimed a sum of Rs.1,05,114/- towards electricity and
water charges upto February, 2001. The defendants,
however, have not told the Court how they arrived at the
aforesaid amount of Rs.1,05,114/-. Clause 4 of the lease
deed provided that lessee shall pay charges for consumption
of electricity and water, as per actual bills of the authorities
concerned. No bills of electricity and water charges for the
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 50 of 63
period upto 31st August, 1999 have been proved by the
defendants in the Court. In fact, neither the written
statement nor the evidence produced by the defendants
gives precise amount of electricity and water charges with
respect to electricity and water consumed in the tenanted
premises upto 31st August, 1999. In the absence of
evidence from the defendants quantifying the amount of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 43Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
electricity and water charges in respect of electricity and
water consumed upto 31st August, 1999, the Court is not in
a position to direct payment of any specified amount by the
tenant in this regard.
Maintenance Charges, Ground Rent & Insurance
34. The defendants in CS(OS) No.2569/2000 have also
claimed a sum of Rs.48,984/- alleged to have been paid to
the Capital Maintenance Society towards maintenance
charges. In CS(OS) No.524/2004, the landlords, who are
plaintiffs in the suit have claimed a sum of Rs.1,17,909/-
towards maintenance charges for the period from 1 st
August, 2001 to 30th April, 2004 and Rs.9250/- towards
ground rent and insurance for the period from 1 st April,
2001 to 30th April, 2004. The maintenance charges have
been claimed at the rate of Rs.3573/- per month whereas
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 51 of 63
ground rent and insurance appears to have been claimed at
the rate of Rs.250/- per month. The counter claim does not
indicate either the rate at which maintenance charges have
been claimed nor does it disclose the period to which these
charges pertain. Moreover a perusal of Exhibits D-6 and D-
7, which are the confirmation of deposits, would show that
the plaintiff company has paid maintenance charges upto
31st March, 2002. A perusal of the lease deed dated 18th
April, 1995 would show that the tenant was liable to pay all
proportionate society dues and charges including charges
for common maintenance, service, capital assets,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 44Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
replacement fund, ground rent, fire fighting fund etc. as per
the bills received from the maintenance society. The
defendants have not produced any evidence to prove that
maintenance charges, ground rent and insurance have been
paid by them to the maintenance society. The defendants
are entitled to claim these amounts from the plaintiff
company only after they have paid them to the maintenance
society. Since no such proof has been produced by them,
no amount can be awarded to them towards maintenance
charges, ground rent and insurance.
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 52 of 63
Increase in House Tax
35. The defendants in CS(OS) No.2569/2000 have, as
a part of their counter claim, demanded a sum of
Rs.12,09,381/- towards increase in property tax for the
years 1995-96 to 2000-01. In CS(OS) No.524/2004, they
have claimed a sum of Rs.12,94,092/- towards increase in
property tax for the years 2000-01 to 2003-04. Thus, the
alleged increased in the property tax for the year 2000-01
has been claimed in the counter claim as well as in the
independent suit filed by them. Admittedly, the increase in
property tax was effected vide assessment order dated 26 th
March, 1999, which is Exhibit DW1/4. Vide this order, the
ratable value was increased to Rs.14,26,776/- less 10% for
the year 1995-96 and the same ratable value was adopted
for the years 1996-97 to 1999-2000. The notice of demand
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 45Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
issued by the NDMC to the defendants are Exhibit DW1/5
and DW1/6. Admittedly, the aforesaid assessment order
have been set aside in an appeal filed by the defendants.
This fact has been expressly admitted by DW-2 P.S. Mangla
in his cross-examination. He admitted that the assessment
order was set aside and appeal filed by the NDMC in the
High Court was also turned down. He has further admitted
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 53 of 63
that after setting aside of assessment order, no revision has
since been done. Since the increase in ratable value of the
tenanted premises and consequent increase in the demand
of property tax has been set aside and no fresh assessment
order has thereafter been passed, the defendants cannot
claim any amount from the plaintiff towards increase in
property tax so long as a fresh assessment order is not
passed and fresh demand is not raised accordingly.
During the course of arguments, it was contended
by the learned counsel for the defendants that the
defendants had made a part payment to the NDMC in
compliance of the interim order passed by the Court. Even
if that be so, the defendants cannot claim any amount from
the plaintiff towards increase in property tax till a fresh
assessment order is passed and a fresh demand is raised
against them. Of course, as and when a fresh assessment
order is passed and a demand is raised accordingly, the
defendants would be entitled to recover the increase in
demand to the extent it pertains to the period for which the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 46Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
plaintiff company is held liable to pay rent/damages for use
and occupation to them, from the plaintiff.
Mesne Profits & Hire Charges
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 54 of 63
36. A perusal of the proceedings dated 7th May, 2001
and 11th July, 2001 passed in CS(OS) No.2569/2000 would
show that on 7th May, 2001, learned counsel for the
defendants stated that he was ready to take back
possession of the premises even on that day without
prejudice to the rights and contentions of the parties. The
proceedings also show that there was no response from the
plaintiff to the above referred offer made by the defendants
through their counsel. However, on 6th April, 2004, the
learned counsel for the plaintiff stated that the plaintiff was
inclined to deposit the keys of the premises in the Court.
The keys were accordingly deposited in the Court on 28 th
May, 2004 and were directed to be kept in safe custody. A
perusal of the order passed by this Court on 16 th
September, 2004 shows that on that day the learned
counsel for the plaintiff objected to handing over possession
to the defendants in CS(OS) No.524/2004 despite the fact
that the keys were in possession of the Court in CS(OS) No.
2569/2000. In the face of the objection of plaintiff Tata
Finance Limited, the Court directed that the prima facie
they would become liable for payment of damages upto the
date when possession would be handed back to the landlord
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 55 of 63
though a final decision on this question would have to be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 47Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
passed in Suit No.524/2004. A perusal of the order dated
11th May, 2005 shows that on that day, after some
arguments, it was agreed between the parties that without
prejudice to their rights and contentions, keys of the suit
property be delivered to the defendants in CS(OS)
No.2569/2000 so as to enable them to utilize the premises
or give it on rent. It was further agreed that they would not
sell or transfer the suit property pending final disposal of
the suit.
37. It would, thus, be seen that not only did the
plaintiff fail to accept the offer made by the learned counsel
for the defendants on 7th May, 2001 to take back possession
of the suit premises without prejudice to rights and claims
of the parties, it went to the extent of opposing the request
made by the defendants for handing over the keys of the
premises to them despite the fact that the keys had already
been deposited in the Court. The defendants, therefore,
were deprived of use of the tenanted premises for the period
from 7th May, 2001 to 11th May, 2005 solely on account of
total untenable attitude adopted by the plaintiff company.
Since the plaintiff company had already shifted from the
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 56 of 63
tenanted premises and had also offered possession of the
same to the defendants, there was no justification for not
accepting the offer made by the defendants on 7th May,
2001 and then oppose the request to deliver the keys of the
tenanted premises to them. Had the plaintiff accepted the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 48Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
fair offer made by the learned counsel for the
defendants/landlords in the Court on 7th May, 20091, the
defendants would have been able to utilize the tenanted
premises or let it out to another tenant. I, therefore, have
no hesitation in holding that the plaintiff in CS(OS)
No.2569/2000 is liable to pay damages for use and
occupation, maintenance charges, ground rent and
insurance for the aforesaid period. The plaintiff company is
also liable to pay the electricity and water charges, if any,
paid/payable by the defendants to the NDMC for the
aforesaid period.
As regards electricity and water charges, as noted
earlier, since no evidence has been led by the defendants to
prove what were the charges demanded by the NDMC and
paid by them for the aforesaid period, it is not possible for
the Court to direct payment of any specific amount or allow
its adjustment to the defendants. No payment or
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 57 of 63
adjustment towards maintenance charges, ground rent and
insurance can be allowed to the landlords, as they have
failed to prove the payments, if any, made by them in this
regard.
ISSUE Nos. 4, 5, 8 and 9 & 11
38. In view of my findings on issue Nos. 6, 7 and 10,
defendant Nos. 2 and 3 in CS(OS) No.2569/2000, who are
also plaintiff Nos. 1 and 2 in CS(OS) No.524/2004 are
entitled to recover damages for use and occupation as well
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 49Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
as hire charges for furnishings and fixtures from the
plaintiff in CS(OS) No.2569/2000 for the period from 7 th
May, 2001 to 11th May, 2005. The plaintiff in CS(OS)
No.2569/2000 had admittedly deposited a sum of
Rs.25,82,400/- with the defendants in that suit towards
security, which was to be refunded on expiry of the lease or
vacation of the premises by the lessee, whichever be earlier,
against handing over peaceful possession of the tenanted
premises along with furnishings and fittings in good
condition and after deducting dues, if any. The amount of
damages for use and occupation including charges for
furnishings and fixtures at the agreed rate of Rs.1,34,500/-
per month for the period from 7th May, 2001 to 6th May,
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 58 of 63
2002, comes to Rs.16,14,000/-. The amount of mesne
profit and hire charges for the period from 7th May, 2002 to
6th May, 2003 comes to Rs. 16,14,000/-. The amount of
mesne profit and hire charges for the period from 7th May,
2003 to 6th May, 2004 comes to Rs. 16,14,000/-. The
amount of mesne profit and hire charges for the period from
7th May, 2004 to 11th May 2005 comes to Rs. 16,31,932/-.
39. In Ramnik Vallabhdas Madhvani and others v.
Taraben Pravinlal Madhvani, (2004) 1 SCC 497,
Supreme Court, with respect to calculation of interest on
mesne profits, inter alia, observed as under:-
"9. A mistake has been committed by the
High Court in calculation of interest on
mesne profits. Interest has to be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 50Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
calculated on yearly basis because the
amount of mesne profits on which
interest is to be awarded has to be
arrived at on year-to-year basis. Mesne
profits for the first year would be from 5-
5-1969 to 4-5-1970, for the second year it
will be from 5-5-1970 to 4-5-1971 and so
on. It keeps adding on from year to year.
The total amount of mesne profits found
due by the High Court on the basis of the
Commissioner(cid:128)s report comes to
Rs.38,41,920. This amount is the total of
mesne profits calculated on yearly basis.
Interest cannot be allowed on the whole
amount from the beginning. Interest had
to be worked out on amounts falling due
towards mesne profits on yearly basis i.e.
on the amount of mesne profits which
could be taken to be due to the plaintiff
at the end of each successive year."
40. The learned counsel for the landlords pressed for
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 59 of 63
payment of interest while computing mesne profits. In
Mahant Narayana Dasjee Varu and Others v. Board of
Trustees, Tirumalai Tirupathi Devasthanam, AIR 1965
SC 1231, Supreme Court while dealing with computation of
interest on mesne profits, inter alia, held as under:-
"Under Section 2(12) of the Civil
Procedure Code which contains the
definition of "mesne profits", interest is
an integral part of mesne profits and has,
therefore, to be allowed in the
computation of mesne profits itself. That
proceeds on the theory that the person in
wrongful possession appropriating
income from the property himself gets the
benefit of the interest on such income."
However, since no mesne profits/damages for use
and occupation are being awarded to the landlords for pre-
suit period, and pendente lite and future interest to be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 51Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
awarded under Section 34 of the CPC is in the discretion of
the Court, these judgments do not apply to the facts of this
case.
41. Since the security deposit was lying with the
defendants and it became payable on the date constructive
possession was delivered to the defendants, the plaintiff in
CS(OS) No.2569/2000 is entitled to interest on the aforesaid
amount in terms of Section 3 of the Interest Act, which to
the extent it is relevant, provides that in any proceedings for
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 60 of 63
the recovery of any debt or damages or in any proceedings
in which a claim for interest in respect of any debt or
damages already paid is made, the court may, if it thinks fit,
allow interest to the person entitled to the debt or damages
or to the person making such claim, as the case may be, at
a rate not exceeding the current rate of interest, if the
proceedings relate to a debt payable by virtue of a written
instrument at a certain time, then, from the date when the
debt is payable to the date of institution of the proceedings.
Since the security was refundable to plaintiff in
CS(OS) No.2569/2000 under the written agreement Exhibit
P-11, the aforesaid provisions of Interest Act are applicable
and the plaintiffs in CS(OS) No.2569/2000 is awarded
interest on the security deposit for the period from 1st
October, 1999 till the date of filing of the suit.
Exhibit P-8 is the notice/letter written by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1608881/ 52Kamal Mangla & Ors. vs Tata Finance Ltd. on 11 March, 2011
plaintiff company to the defendants seeking refund of the
security deposit along with interest at the rate of 24% per
annum. In the facts and circumstances of the case, I feel
that interest on security deposit should be awarded at the
rate of 6% per annum. The amount of interest, on the
security deposit, at the rate of 6% per annum for the period
CS(OS)No.2569/2000 & 524/2004 Page 61 of 63
from 1st October, 1999 till 15th November, 2000, the date of
filing of the suit, comes to Rs.1,74,312/-.
42. After adjusting the amount of security deposit and
interest thereon till the date of filing of the suit from the
amount of damages and hire charges for furnishings and
fittings to which the defendants in CS(OS) No.2569/2000
are held entitled for use and occupation of the suit premises
by the plaintiff in the aforesaid suit, defendant Nos. 2 and 3
in CS(OS) No.2569/2000 are entitled to recover the balance
amount of Rs.37,17,221/-from the plaintiff in CS(OS)
No.2569/2000. The issues are decided accordingly.

against the plaintiff company in CS(OS) No.2569/2000, which is also defendant in CS(OS)
No.524/2004. The amount of security deposit gets adjusted in rent and hire charges of about 20
months. I do not propose to award pendente lite interest to the plaintiff company in CS(OS)
No.2569/2000 on the security deposit and on the amount of mesne profits, to the defendants in the
aforesaid suit, for the period upto 11th May, 2005 when the plaintiff in the suit agreed that the keys
of the tenanted premises may be delivered to the defendants in that suit, so as to balance their

Rs.37,17,221/-, at the rate of 6% per annum, with effect from 12th May, 2005 till realization of the
