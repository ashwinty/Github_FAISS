mortgage deed dated April 1, 1952 for a sum of Rs.30,000 in favour of the company, both as the
"karta" of the joint family and also as the guardian of the minors defendants No.3 and 4 ; that all the
assets and liabilities of the controlled business of the company statutorily stood transfered to and
vested in the plaintiff corporation consequent upon the coming into force of the Life Insurance
Corporation Act. 1956 (hereinafter reffered to as "the Act"); that defendant No. 1 even after
admitting the amount due under the suit mortgage failed to pay the same. It was alleged that
defendant No.1 unjustly sought to repudiate his liability in his letter dated August 6, 1959 sent

5. The defendants contested the suit on several grounds contending inter alia, that the
plaintiff-corporation has no locus standi to institute the suit; that the benefit of the mortgage in
question had not vested in the plantiff corportion because it did not form part of the controlled
businees of the company ; that on March 1, 1952, the company's registration to carry on life
insurance business was concelled under the Insurance Act, 1938 ; therefore, the company could not
have carried on the business of lending money ; that the transaction itself was void and inoperative ;
that the civil court had no jurisdiction to entertain and decide the suit ; that when the defendants
entered into the transaction, the company had excercised fraud upon the defendants ; that the entire
amount of consideration of Rs.30,000 had not been paid ; that a sum of Rs.12,000 which was
retained by the company as interest-free deposit could not be held to constitute good and valid
consideration and that the defendants has paid back Rs.18,000 received by way of consideration
with interest, fully discharging their obligation. It was further contended that the alleged purchase
of shares of the value of Rs.12,000 was not out of their own volition and free will and was not
binding on the defandants.
6. There was a counter-statment filed by the plaintiff corporation with the permission of the court as
per exhibit 23 ; and the defendants also field a rejoinder as per exhibit 30. It is not necessary to refer
to the same.
7. On the pleadings, the trial court framed as many as 19 issues. The trial court negatived the
contentions of the defendants and decreed the suit as aforesaid. In the appeal preferred by the
defendants, the learned District Judge has reversed the decree and dismissed the suit. In the appeal
before the learned District Judge, only issues Nos.1,3,4,5,6,10,11,12 and 15 were pressed.
8. The learned District Judge, inter alia, held that the mortagage transaction did not form part of the
controlled business of the company and consequently, the right of action in regard therto did not
vest in the plantiff corporation under section 7 of the Act; that the consideration of Rs.30,000
mentioned in the mortages deed (exhibit 75) in so far it included the sum of Rs.12,000 retained by
the company as interest free deposit to be used subsequently for allotment of shares in favour of
defendants Nos.1 and 2 failed. In regard to the sum of Rs.12,000 originally taken as interest-free
deposit and later transferred to the shares acccount, the learned District Judge held that the
adjustment of the deposit for allotment of shares in favour of defendant No 1 and his two brothers
was tainted and that it was the duty of the company to have disclosed the fact of cancellation of the
licence and the notice issued in that connectiojns by the Controller, before bringing pressure on the
defendants to purchase shares on incurring the debt from the company. It was also held that the
company was in a position to dominate and to influence the defendants in respect of the
consideration of the mortgage to the extent of Rs.12,000 and as such, it stood vitiated ; therefore the
defendants were entitled to avoid the transaction in question to that extent. Accordingly, the learned
District Judge allowed the appeal set aside the preliminary decree passed by the trial court and
dismissed the appellant's suit.
before us, the defandants sought for amendment of the written statement. By the order dated June
8, 1984, we have allowed the application I A III filed by the defendants seeking amendment to the
written statement. As a result thereof, the following plea has been permitted to be raised :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150214/ 2Life Insurance Corporation Of ... vs Devendrappa Bujjappa Kadabi And ... on 17 October, 1986
"17A. The mortaged transaction between the plantiff and defandant No.1 and others is illegal and
void and since it contraveens the provisions of sections 23 and 24 of the Contract Act reasd with
section 54 of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, inasmuch as its object and consideration consisted of
the prices of shares of the Karnataka United Insurance Co. the defendants on credit basis. The
plaintiff cannot therefore enforce the said mortgage claim against these defendants who are the
mortgages."
9. The defendants have also filed a memo dated June 8, 1984 which reads thus :
"The advocate for the respondents submits as under :
The respondents submit that the payments made by them towards the mortgage amount would not
be claimed back by way of refund or restitution from the plantiff appellant corporation as a result of
the plea allowed to be taken by this hon'ble court."
10. It is, no doubt, contended on behalf of the plaintiff corporation that the findings recorded by the
learned District Judge are not correct and are opposed to law and the prelimanary decree passed by
the trial court is entitled to be restored. However, it is not disputed before us and it also a finding of
fact recorded by the learned District Judge -that out of the consideration amount of Rs.30,000, a
sum of Rs.12,000 was not paid in cash but was retained as interest-free deposit to be adjusted
towards the share certificates were issued to the first defendant and his two brothers for the
aforesaid sum of Rs.12,000.
11. It is also not disputed before us that the remaining sum if the consitituion amount for Rs.18,000
and the interest thereon had been paid by the defendants before th suit and that the suit claim
relates wholly to this disputed sum of Rs.12,000 and interest thereon .
12. In view of these undisputed facts, we do not consider it necessary to go into the other questions
raised by the plaintiff- corporation bearing on the correctness of the findings recorded by the
learned appellate judge except the following points :
(1) Whether the entire mortagage transaction in question between the company and the defendants
was in contravention of the provision contained in section 54A of the Indian Companies Act, 1913
and as such it was null and void having regard to the provisions contained in section 23 and 24 of
the Indian Contract Act?
(2) If not whether the mortgage transaction in question was void only to the extent of the
consideration amount of Rs. 12,000?
(3) What order ?
13. Points Nos 1 and 2.- These two points can conveniently be considered together. The company
was a limited company. It was not a subsidiary company of a public company. At the relevant point
of time, the Indian Companies Act, 1913, was in force. Article 2 of the Articles of association (exhibit
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150214/ 3Life Insurance Corporation Of ... vs Devendrappa Bujjappa Kadabi And ... on 17 October, 1986
156) of the company provided that none of the funds of the company shall be employed in the
purchase of or lent on shares of the company Sub-section (2) of section 54A of the Indian
Companies Act, 1913 was a follows :
"54A Restrictions on purchase by company or loans by company for purchase of its own shares.- (2)
No company limited by shares other than a privatte company not being a subsidiary company of a
public company shall give whether directily or indirectly and whether by means of a loan guarantee,
the provision of security or otherwise any financial assistance for the purpose of or in connection
with a purchase made or to be made by an person of any shares in the company :
Provided that nothing in this section shall be taken to prohibit where the lending of money is part of
the ordinary business of a company, the lending of money by the company in the ordinary course of
its business."
14. Thus, article 2 of the articles of association of the company and the aforesaid sub-section (2) of
section 54A of the Indian Companies Act, 1913 prohibited the company from giving directly or
indirectly any financial assistance by any means for the purpose of or in connection with a purchase
made or to made by any person or any shares in the company. It is not the case of the
plaintiff-corporation tht lending money was part of the oridnary businees of the company in the
ordinary course of its business. No doubt para 7 of the memorandum of association permitted the
company to grant loans in general on mortgages or otherwise to approved company to grant loans in
general on mortgages or otherwise to approved individuals...... as are carried on by purely loaning
and investment companies and in particular without prejudice to the generality of the words
contained in the said paragraph. But a mere provision in the memorandum of association to enable
the company to do the business of lending money is not sufficient to attract the proviso to
sub-section (2) of section 54A of the Indian Companies Act, 1913 unless it is shown that lending of
money was part of the ordinary business of the company and the loan in question was made by the
company in the ordinary course of its business. Therefore, in this case, there is no scope for applying
the proviso to sub-section (2) of section 54A of the Indian Companies Act 1913 as that part of the
loan was clearly intended to enable purchase of the shares of the lender-company itself.
15. In view of the prohibition to lend money or give any financial assistant in any manner by the
company to purchase its shares the adjustment of Rs.12,000 being a part of the consideration of the
suit mortgage by the company weas clearly to increase its own share capital. The adjustment of the
part of the consideration of the mortgage towards the share capital was forbidden by law. In the
instant case, as already pointed out the entire consideration of the suit mortgage was not unlawful.
It was only to the extent of Rs.12,000 out of the consideration of Rs.30,000 that the consideration
was not lawful as it was forbidden by law, i.e section 54A (2) of the Indian Companies Act 1913.
Therefore we are now required to see whether the entire suit mortgage was void or it was void only
to the extent of Rs.12,000 which was adjusted towardd share certificates of the company issued to
defendant No.1 and his two brothers. The answer to this question depends upon the effect of section
24 of the Indian Contract act on the mortgage in question.
16. Sections 23 and 24 of the Indian Congtract Act, are as follows :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150214/ 4Life Insurance Corporation Of ... vs Devendrappa Bujjappa Kadabi And ... on 17 October, 1986
"23. The consideration or object of an agreement is lawful, unless-
it is forbidden by law; or is of such a nature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any
law ; or is fraudulent ; or involves or implies injuiry to the persons or property of another or the
court regards it as immoral or opposed to public policy In each of these cases the considration or
object of an agreement is said to be unlawful. Every agreement of which the object or consideration
is unlawful is void.
24. If any part of single consideration for one or more objects or any one of part of any one of several
consideration for a single object is unlawful the agreement is void."
17. There is a distinction between an agreement and transfer of property Sections 23 and 24 of the
Indian Contract Act, deal with consideration and object of an agreement. The provision of the
Indian Contract Act do not, as a matter of course apply to transfer of property. Section 4 of the
Transfer of Property Act provides thus :
"4. The chapters and sections of this Act which relate to contracts shall be taken as part of the Indian
Contract Act, 1872.
And section 54, paragraphs, 2,3,59,107 and 123 shall be read as supplemental to the Indian
Registration Act, 1908."
18. From the aforesaid provisions contained in section 4 of the Transfer of Property Act, it is cleare
that all the provisions of the Indian Contract Act are not made applicable to transfer of immovable
properties. Therefore the provisions of the Indian Contract Act, as a whole cannot be reas as part of
the Transfer of Property Act. It is only such parts or provisions of the Transfer of Property Act which
relates to contract alone that are to be read as part of the Indian Contract Act. Therefore, such of the
provisions in the Transfer of Property Act, which relates to contracts shall have to be interpreted in
the light of the provisions contained in the Indian Contract Act. Transfer of ownership of immovable
property is effected by compliance with certain legal formalities, in accordance with the provisions
contained in the Transfer of Property and Registration Acts. Once there is a completed conveyance
the matter does not remain in the domain of contract and the consequences of the distinction
between an agreement which is normally executory and a completed conveyance are attracted. A
mortgage is both a debt an conveyance. Section 6(h) of the Transfer of Property Act, provides that :
"No transfer can be made (1) in so far it is opposed to the nature of the interest affected thereby, or
(2) for an unlawful object or consideration within the meaning of section 23 of the Indian Contract
Act, 1872 or (3) to a person legally disqualified to be a transferee."
19. Thus, section 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, which deals with the topic of "what may be
transferred" provides that no transfer can be made for an unlawful object or consideration within
the meaning of section 23 of the Indian Contract Act. The result is that the validity of a transfer of
property must be tested in the light of section 23 of the Indian Contract Act. Apart from section 6(h)
of the Transfer of Property Act, which makes only section 23 of the Indian Contract Act applicable to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150214/ 5Life Insurance Corporation Of ... vs Devendrappa Bujjappa Kadabi And ... on 17 October, 1986
transfer of property there is no other provision in the Transfer of Property Act, which makes section
24 of the Indian Contract Act applicable to transfer of property.
20. In Dip Naraian Singh v Nageshwar Prasad, AIR 1930 All [FB] the question as to whether section
24 of the Indian Contract Act was appliable to transfer of immovable property was considered. The
principal question that was considered by the Full Bench was as to the legal effect of including
non-transferable occupancy land along wiht other properties which were transferable occupany land
along wiht other properties which were transferable in a resigtered mortgage deed it was held by
Sulaiman J as follows (at page 2) :
"There can be no doubt that there is a clear distinction between a contract which still remains to be
performed and specific performance of which may be sought and a conveyance by which title to
property has actually passes. Cases of mere contract are governed by that provisions of the Contract
Act. Cases of the transfer of immovable property are governed by the Transfer of Property Act. A
mere contract to mortgage or sale would not amount to an actual transfer of anu interest in the
immovable property (section 54, Transfer of Property Act), but a deed of sale of mortgage. of duly
registered would operate as a conveyance of such interest. Once a document transferring immovable
property has been registered the transaction passess out of the domain of a mere contract into one
of a conveyance. Such a completed transaction would be governed by the provisions of the Transfer
of Property Act, and only so much of the Contract Act as are applicable thereto.
It is significant that the whole of the Contract Act has not been made applicable to transfer of
immovable properties. Section 4 Transfer of Property Act, merely makes certain provisions of the
Transfer of Property Act, relating to contracts as part of the Contract Act and not vice versa.
It is section 6(h) Transfer or Property which lay down that no transfer can be made for an unlawful
object or consideration witin the meaning of section 23 Contract Act. Sub-clause (i) further provides
that nothing in that section would authories a tenant having an untranferable right of occupancy to
assign his right as such tenant.
Thus an attempted transfer of an untranferable right of an occupancy tenant is merely declared to be
unauthorised and therefore void and ineffectual. Similarly a transfer for an unlawful object or
consideration is declared to be void and ineffective. So far as these sections go they do not lay down
the law that if such a non-transferable interest is included among other transferable properties the
whole transaction is illegal. It is noteworthy that in order to bring in the operation of section 6(h)
the object or consideration for the transfer should be unlawful. The section would be inappicable
where the object of the consideration for the transfer is itself not unlawful but the transfer may be
ineffective on some other ground...
Coming back to the quesition as to how much of the provisions of the Contract Act are to be deemed
to have been incorported in the Transfer of Property Act, I must point out that what has in some
cases been overlooked is that section 24, Contracts Act has not been made applicable to transfers of
immovable property. There is therefore no justification for stating broadly that even if the transfers
of several items of properties can be split up and separated the whole transaction is void because
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150214/ 6Life Insurance Corporation Of ... vs Devendrappa Bujjappa Kadabi And ... on 17 October, 1986
one part of it may be vitiated. Of course, where the object of the consideration of the transfer is
unlawful, as that word is defined in section 23, Contract Act the transfer is not effective... If the
effect of enforcing the contract would necessarily be to defeat the provisions of any law, the contract
would undoubtedly be void, but if it consists of several distinct parts which can be separated the
whole transaction would not be bad unless the provisions of section 24, Contract Act, are applicable
to it."
21. The decision in Dip Narain Singh AIR 1930 All [FB] was followed in Gappu Singh v. Har Charan
AIR 1935 Oudh 501 by a Division Bench of the Oudh Chief Court and it was held that section 24 of
the Indian Contract Act did not apply to the transfers under Transfer of Property Act ; therefore,
where a transfer of several items of properties could be split up and separted, the whole transaction
was not void because one part of it was vitiated. A Division Bench of the same court again in Lal
Bhagwat Singh v. Harikishen Das, AIR 1942 Oudh 1, reiterated the same view following the decision
in Dip Narain Singh, AIR 1930 All 1 [FB] and distinguished the decision in Muhammad Khalilur
Rahman Khan v. Mohammad Muzammilullah Khan, AIR 1933 All 468 as being not applicable to the
case of a mortgage deed under which some transferable and non-transferbale properties were
mortgaged . In Muhammad Khalilur Rahman Khan, AIR 1933 All 468 no opinion different from the
view of the Full Bench in Dip Narain Singh AIR 1930 All 1 [FB] it was held that in a case where the
terms of the deed contained two separate contracts in the first part of which the debtor admitted a
sum of Rs.20,000 as due by him and undertook to pay the same on demand, the debtor was quite
compenent to enter into that contract. In the second part the debtor mortgaged certain property by
way of security. This part was invalid. The two parts could be separted. Therefore, it was held that
the plaintiuff was entitled to maintain the suit on the basis of the personal covenant to pay as per the
first part of the deed, which the debtor had agreed to pay on demand. It was further held that the
right of the plantiff to recover the amount due on the basis of the agreement was perfectly valid as it
was not dependent on the failure of the debtor to perform the contract of mortgage; therefore it was
held that section 24 of the Indian Contract Act did not apply. thus the decision in Mohd. Rahman
AIR 1933 All 468, also rested on the severability of the valid portion of the contract. This was also
the principle which was adopted in Dip Narain Singh AIR 1930 All 1 [FB].
22. It may also be noted that in Eastern Mercantile Bank Ltd. v N T Philip, the entire mortgage deed
has been held to be void, applying section 24 of the Indian Contract Act. That was a case where an
agreement to stifle the prosecution was the consideration for the mortgaged in the mortgage deed
that a sum of Rs.2,400 was misappropriated by the son of the mortgagor and as a compromise, the
police prosecution pending against the son of the mortgagor was to be withdrawn. As the whole
consideration for the mortgage was opposed to public policy inasmuch as it was for stifling
prosecution and as they was no question of severance of any part of the mortgage deed from the
invalid portion, as such the entire transaction was vitiated, consequently section 23 of the Contract
Act itself was attracted to the case ; therefore there was no question of application of section 24 of
the Indian Contract Act. Hence the decisions in Eastern Mercentile Bank Ltd., , cannot be held as
laying down the law that section 24 of the Indian Contract Act applies to the completed conveyance.
23. Similar is the position in Soundatti Yellamma Municipality v. Shripadbhat Seshbhat Joshi, AIR
1933 Bom 132. In that case, the Municipality leased the levy of toll on pilgrims though it has no
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150214/ 7Life Insurance Corporation Of ... vs Devendrappa Bujjappa Kadabi And ... on 17 October, 1986
power to levy toll on pilgrims which was in the nature of tax. The lessee failed to pay the amount due
under the lease. The Muncipality filed a suit for recovery of the amount. One of the contentions
raised by the defendant was that the Municipality was not competent to levy toll on pilgrims;
therefore the contract granted to him by the Municipality to levy on and collect the toll from the
pilgrims was altogether void. It was held that the Municipality had no power to impose the toll.
Consquently, it was held that the contract itself was void. As such there was no question of
application of section 24 of the Indian Contract Act. Nevertheless, it observed in that case that
where a part of the consideration was unlawful, the general rule was that whena valid part could not
be severed from the illegal part of the contract, the contract was altogether void.
24. It follows from the abvoe discussion that section 24 of the Indian Contract Act does not apply to
a completed transaction of a transfer of property ; the provisions of the Indian Contract Act apply to
the transfer of property only to the extent they are made appplicable. Section 6(h) of the Transfer of
Property Act makes applicable the provisions of section 23 of the Indian Contract Act to transfer of
property. Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act does no prohibit enforcement of the valid portion of
the transfer of property or debt, if it is severable from the invalid portion. Applying the aforesaid
conclusions to the facts of the present case, it is seen that the suit transaction is a mortgage. The
mortgage is both a debt and a transfer of interest in immovable property. The mortgage debt in
question was valid to the extent of Rs.18,000. The remaining portion of the debt amounting to
Rs.12,000 was invalid because it was hit by sub- section (2) of section 54A of the Indian Companies
Act, 1913 read with section 23 of the Indian Contract Act. The invalid portion of the debt is
severable. The valid portion has already paid.
25. It is an established principle, rooted in public policy, that the courts of law do not aid or do not
become instrumental in enforcing transactions ex turpi causa. We may usefully refer to the
observations made in Selangor United Rubber Estates Ltd. v. Cradock (No. 3) [1968] 2 All 1073,
1150 (Ch D) : "It is not disputed by the plaintiff company that if a contract or consensual
arrangement is illegal ex facie, or made for illegal purpose then the court will not assist in enforcing
the contract or consensual arrangement' (whether, eg, by specific performance, money judgment or
damages) or to recover property (including money) passed in pursuance of it. The plaintiff company
contends, however that such refusal of the court to assist is limited to cases of contract or consensual
arrangement' and does not extend in particular to claims based on breach of trust.
26. The ambit, within which such consequences of the illegality operate, has by no means been
clearly defined. This amply appeared from the arguments before me. The usual field of its operation
is certainly contract ; but then contract is the field which gives most scope for its operation.
27. The principle governing such consequences of illegality is not however, just a twig of any
particular branch of the law but is rooted deeply in public policy - that the courts are not to be
instruments for aiding illegality in contract, but may be instruments for aiding illegality in other
branches of the law. It is accordance with this substantial public policy nature of the courts' refusal
of aid to illegality that such illegality is not treated as a matter of pleading or a matter merely as
between the parties but as a matter of which the court will, of its own initative take cognisance
irrespective of pleadings or wishes of the parties. The objection to aiding illegality is thus not limited
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/150214/ 8Life Insurance Corporation Of ... vs Devendrappa Bujjappa Kadabi And ... on 17 October, 1986
in its origin in public policy to any particular form of action."
28. This being the position the plaintiff corporation is not entitled to recover the suit claim as it
represents the invalid portion of the consideration of the mortgage.
29. For the reasons stated above, points 1 and 2 are answered as follows :
The entire mortgage transaction between the company and the defendants was not in contravention
of the provisions contained in section 54A of the Indian Companies Act, 1913 ; as such, the entire
mortgage transaction was not invalid. The mortgage transaction in question in so far as it included
Rs.12,000 as part fo the consideration which was adjusted towards the share capital of the company
was invalid.
30. Having regard to the fact that the amount claimed in the suit under the suit mortgage admittedly
represented the sum of Rs.12,000 adjusted towards the share capital of the company and the
interest thereon, and as it is held that it was invalid, the plaintiff corporation is not entitled to
recover the same. Hence, the ultimate conclusion reached by the learned appellate Judge that the
suit has to be dismissed, is correct and it is accordingly affirmed. Consequently, the appeal has to
fail.
31. For the reasons stated above, the appeal is dismissed. However, there will be no order as to costs.
32. At the end, we consider it necessary to clarify that the dismissal of the suit does not come in the
way of the United Karnataka Insurance Co. Ltd., Dharwad, calling upon the defendants to surrender
the shares.
