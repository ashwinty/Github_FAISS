Arijit Banerjee, J.:
1. This appeal is directed against the Judgment and order dated June
22, 2022 whereby the appellant's writ petition being W.P. 619 of 2018 was
dismissed. The writ petitioner had challenged the refusal on the part of
2
Kolkata Municipal Corporation (in short, 'KMC') to refund the Earnest
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 1Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
Money Deposit (in short, 'EMD') on the ground that the same stood forfeited
in terms of Clause 13 of the notice inviting the tender in question.
2. Although a point of law was not argued by the parties either before the
learned Single Judge or before us, for the sake of completeness, I wish to
briefly discuss the same. The writ petition was filed in the name of Esssem
Enterprise which has been described as the petitioner in the cause title of
the writ petition. In paragraph 1 of the writ petition it is stated that the
petitioner is a sole proprietorship. In the affidavit affirmed in support of the
writ petition, the deponent, Santanu Mukherjee, has stated that he carries
on business in the name and style of 'Essem Enterprise'.
3. It is settled law that a proprietorship concern is not a legal entity. No
legal proceeding is maintainable in the name of such a concern. Any legal
proceeding has to be instituted in the name of the proprietor of the
business. In this connection one may refer to the following decisions:
(i) Svapn Constructions v. IDPL Employees Co-operative Group
Housing Society Ltd. & Ors.; reported at 2005 SCC OnLine Del
1392.
(ii) Miraj Marketing Corporation v. Vishaka Engineering and Anr.;
reported at 2005 (79) DRJ 209 (DB).
(iii) Bhagvan Manaji Marwadi v. Hiraji Premaji Marwadi.; reported at
(1932) 34 BOM LR 1112.

(iv) Neogi Ghosh & Co. v. Sardar Nehal Singh & Anr., reported at

(v) Jamunadhar Poddar Firm v. Jamunaram Bhakat & Ors.,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 2Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
reported at (1943-44) 48 CWN 203.
(vi) Samrathrai Khetsidas v. Kasturbhai Jagabhai, AIR 1930 Bom
216.
Learned Advocate for the appellant relied on a decision of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Jai Jai Ram Manohar Lal v. National
Building Material Supply, Gurgaon, reported at 1969 (1) SCC 869 . In
that case the plaintiff had sued in his individual name. Subsequently he
sought leave to amend the plaint to sue as proprietor of a Hindu Joint
Family business. The Trial Court allowed the amendment. The High Court
reversed such order. The matter having been carried to the Supreme Court,
setting aside the order of the High Court, the Hon'ble Apex Court held:
(i) A party cannot be refused just relief merely because of some
mistake, negligence, inadvertence or even infraction of the rules of
procedure. The Court always gives leave to amend the pleading of
a party, unless it is satisfied that the party applying was acting
mala fide, or that by his blunder he had caused injury to his
opponent which may not be compensated for by an order of costs.
However negligent or careless may have been the first omission
and however late the proposed amendment, the amendment may
be allowed if it can be made without causing injustice to the other
side.
4
Amulakchand Mewaram and Ors. v. Babulal Kanalal Teliwala, 35 Bom
LR 569 and Purushottam Umeddiar and Co. v. M/s. Mani Lal and
Sons, (1961) 1 SCR 982, followed.
(ii) There is no rule that unless in an application for amendment of
the plaint, it is expressly averred that the error, omission or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 3Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
misdescription is due to a bona fide mistake, the Court has no
power to grant leave to amend the plaint.
(iii) Since the name in which the plaintiff instituted the action was
merely a misdescription of the original plaintiff, no question of
limitation arises and the plaint must be deemed on amendment to
have been instituted in the name of the real plaintiff, on the date
on which it was originally instituted.
Learned Counsel also relied on the decision of a learned Judge of this
Court in the case of J.D. Singh and Ors. v. Calcutta Port Trust reported
at AIR 1994 CAL 148. In that case, while reiterating that the proprietor of
a business must sue in his own name and not in the business name, the
learned Judge, on an oral application of the petitioner allowed substitution
of the petitioner's name in the place and stead of the business name. The
learned Judge further observed that the reason for this rule is that if a
person is allowed to sue in any name other than his own, the same leads to
possibilities of fraud, deception or mistake which the courts must make it
their business to avoid. If a legal proceeding is initiated in the business
name instead of the name of the proprietor of the business, and there is no
suggestion by any of the parties that the mistake was committed for any
ulterior or dishonest motive like, e.g., tax evasion, the Court permits
5
rectification to be made so that an otherwise good claim of a claimant is not
defeated for a mistake of the petitioner or his lawyer.
In the present case, I am of the view that institution of the writ
petition in the business name and not in the name of the proprietor was a
bona fide mistake and not for any oblique motive. Accordingly I grant leave
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 4Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
to the learned Advocate on record for the appellant to substitute the name of
Santanu Mukherjee as the writ petitioner and appellant in the place and
stead of Essem Enterprise by appropriately amending the cause title of the
writ petition and the appeal papers.
4. The facts of the case briefly stated are that for construction of an
underground drainage system on PC connector from Gobinda Khatick Road
to ITC Sonar Bangla, Kolkata, KMC floated a tender vide Notice Inviting
Tender dated January 15, 2016. Since only one tenderer i.e. the appellant
herein, participated, the tender was cancelled. A second tender was floated
vide notice dated February 20, 2016, which also had to be cancelled for the
same reason. The third tender floated vide notice dated May 25, 2016, also
had to be cancelled.
5. Finally, the tender in connection with which the present proceedings
arise, was floated by Notice Inviting Tender dated August 16, 2016. Clause
13 of the notice reads as follows:-
"Bid shall remain valid for a period not less than 120 (one hundred
twenty) days from the last date of submission of Financial
Bid/Sealed Bid. If the bidder withdraws the bid during the validity
6
period of bid, the earnest money as deposited will be forfeited
forthwith without assigning any reason thereof."
6. The appellant Santanu Mukherjee submitted his bid on September 8,
2016, which was also the last date for submission of the financial bid. The
bid was to remain valid till January 6, 2017, i.e., for 120 days from
September 8, 2016.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 5Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
7. The appellant was found to be the lowest tenderer (L1). He deposited
the earnest money of Rs. 11, 99, 536/- according to the terms of the
conditions of tender.
8. It appears that as per the direction of the Direction General (S&D)
KMC, the appellant extended the validity of the bid for another four months,
as recorded in a letter dated December 27, 2016, written by the appellant to
the Commissioner of KMC. In the said letter it is stated inter alia as follows:-
"... Now we have extend the validity of the tender for another 4
months i.e., upto 09 Jan, 17 as per the direction of the DG (S&D)."
9. By a letter dated February 2, 2017, written to the Commissioner of
KMC, the appellant complained of delay in issuance of the work order. In the
said letter the appellant stated inter alia as follows:-
" ... It is prudent to mention here that we had been asked to
extend the validity of tender being LT, for 4 months which also has
already expired on 09 Jan, 2017."
7
10. This was followed by the appellant's letter dated February 23, 2017,
written to the Commissioner, KMC wherein the appellant stated inter alia as
follows:-
"... it now appears, the deptt. is not at all keen to place the
necessary Work Order on us to execute the work. May be the job is
no longer in your priority list.
In the circumstance stated above, it is requested to refund
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 6Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
our EMD within 7 days as we do not envisage the job will be at all
awarded to us in future in spite of being qualified for the job.
Moreover, it would be extremely difficult to execute the work at the
moment as the rate which we quoted an year ago is no longer
workable."
11. According to the appellant, thereafter the executive engineer of KMC
asked the appellant to submit rate analysis on his quoted rate. Under cover
of a letter dated April 12, 2017, the appellant submitted the rate analysis. In
the said letter it was stated inter alia as follows :-
"At the cost of repetition we once again submit that validity of our
quoted rate got expired on 09 Jan 17. Therefore the tender stands
cancelled unless we further extend our validity of rate. In the
circumstances stated above we do not intend to extend our rate
any more.
However, we are enclosing our rate analysis as asked for
in support of our rate quoted in the tender."
8
12. On May 24, 2017 the appellant wrote a letter to the Commissioner of
KMC stating inter alia as follows:-
"In the above tender we stood Lowest in the bid. However the
validity of our rate got expired on 09 Jan, 17. Hence the tender
stands cancelled. We have waited a long period expecting some
favourable reply from your end but to of no avail.
You are therefore requested to refund our EMD of Rs.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 7Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
11,99,536/- at the earliest please."
13. The next correspondence on record is a letter dated November 16,
2017, written by the appellant to the Commissioner of KMC wherein
reference was made to a meeting held between the appellant and the
Commissioner in the latter's chamber.
14. A formal bill for refund of EMD was raised by the appellant on the
Director General (S&D), KMC, under cover of a letter dated May 25, 2018.
15. Finally a letter dated October 31, 2018, was written by the appellant
to the Commissioner, KMC, which was essentially a legal notice for refund of
the EMD. There being no response to such notice, the appellant approached
the learned Single Judge by filing the instant writ petition.
16. Before the learned Single Judge, KMC contended that the petitioner's
EMD stood forfeited in terms of Clause 13 of the notice inviting tender which
has been extracted above. This is because, the petitioner by asking for
refund of his EMD during the validity period of his bid, withdrew his bid
9
before the expiry of the validity period thereby forfeiting his EMD in terms of
Clause 13 of the NIT.
17. The learned Judge noted that initially the petitioner's bid was valid till
January 6, 2017. However, the petitioner having extended the validity period
by four months, such period stood extended till May 6, 2017. The petitioner
having demanded refund of the EMD prior to such date, evinced an
unequivocal intention of withdrawing his bid and therefore fell foul of Clause
13 of the NIT. It was held that the petitioner participated in the tender
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 8Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
process with full knowledge of the terms and conditions thereof and Clause
13 is binding on the petitioner. The consistent stand of the petitioner in the
letters written by him to KMC that the extended validity period expired on
January 9, 2017, was rejected as based on erroneous calculation. The
concluding portion of the impugned judgment and order reads as follows:-
"I do not, therefore, find any reason why the writ Court will aid the
petitioner in getting a refund of the earnest money deposited in the
facts and circumstances of the case. The contention that the
respondent corporation is wrongfully withholding the earnest
money deposit is, on the face of the records, and the notice inviting
tender and its terms and conditions, not tenable. Rather, it is the
petitioner who has acted wrongfully in seeking to withdraw the bid
by demanding refund of the earnest money deposited during the
extended period of validity of the said bid on the basis of a patently
erroneous calculation as to when 120 days from January 6, 2017
would expire.
10
I find no unreasonableness in the stand of the respondent
authorities and I also find no irregularity in the forfeiture of the
earnest money which appears to have been done lawfully
according to a specific clause of the Notice Inviting Tender.
Accordingly, the writ petition is dismissed. There shall be no order
as to costs."
18. Appearing for the appellant, Mr. Biswajit Mukherjee, learned
Advocate, argued two points. Firstly, he said that there was no formal or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 9Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
definite demand for refund of the EMD till May 25, 2018, when the formal
bill was raised. Such demand having been raised much beyond the extended
validity period even taking such date to be May 6, 2017, Clause 13 of the
NIT is not attracted and the EMD cannot be forfeited. Secondly, he argued
that the entire EMD cannot be forfeited as that would amount to unjust
enrichment of KMC. In KMC's affidavit-in-opposition filed before the learned
Single Judge, there is not a whisper that KMC has suffered any loss or
damage by reason of what KMC perceived to be withdrawal of the
petitioner's bid within the validity period.
19. In this connection learned Counsel relied on the following decisions:-
(i) Maula Bux v. Union of India; 1969 (2) SCC 554 (ii) Kailash Nath
Associates v. Delhi Development Authority; (2015) 4 SCC 136 and (iii)
MBL Infrastructure Limited v. Rites Limited & Ors., AIR 2020 Cal 155.
20. Appearing for KMC, Mr. Alok Ghosh, learned Senior Counsel
supported the reasoning and conclusion of the learned Single Judge. He
11
submitted that Clause 13 of the NIT binds the appellant. Having claimed
refund of EMD, by implication the appellant withdrew his bid during the
validity period thereof, entitling KMC to forfeit the appellant's EMD. Mr.
Ghosh, relied on the following decisions:- (i) Michigan Rubber (India) Ltd.
v. State of Karnataka & Ors.; (2012) 8 SCC 216 (ii) Meerut
Development Authority v. Association of Management Studies & Anr.;
(2009) 6 SCC 171 (iii) H.U.D.A & Anr. v. Kewal Krishan Goel & Ors.;
(1996) 4 SCC 249 (iv) National Highways Authority of India v. Ganga
Enterprises & Anr.; (2003) 7 SCC 410.

21. In the case of Maula Bux, (Supra), Section 74 of the Indian Contract
Act fell for discussion. A three Judge Bench quoted with approval the
following passages from an earlier decision of the Supreme Court in the case
of Fateh Chand v. Balkishan Dass, (1964) 1 SCR 515:-
"
"Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act deals with the measure of
damages in two classes of cases: (i) where the contract names a
sum to be paid in case of breach, and (ii) where the contract
contains any other stipulation by way of penalty x x x." "The
measure of damages in the case of breach of a stipulation by way
of penalty is by Section 74, reasonable compensation not
exceeding the penalty stipulated for."
...
"It was urged that the section deals in terms with the right to receive from the party who has broken
the contract reasonable compensation and not the right to forfeit what has already been received by
the party aggrieved. There is however no warrant for the assumption made by some of the High
Courts in India, that Section 74, applies only to cases where the aggrieved party is seeking to receive
some amount on breach of contract and not to cases whereupon breach of contract an amount
received under the contract is sought to be forfeited. In our judgment the expression 'the contract
contains any other stipulation by way of penalty' comprehensively applies to every covenant
involving a penalty whether it is for payment on breach of contract of money or delivery of property
in future, or for forfeiture of right to money or other property already delivered. Duty not to enforce
the penalty clause but only to award reasonable compensation is statutorily imposed upon courts by
section 74. In all cases, therefore, where there is a stipulation in the nature of penalty for forfeiture
of an amount deposited pursuant to the terms of contract which expressly provides for forfeiture,
the Court has jurisdiction to award such sum only as it considers reasonable, but not exceeding the
amount specified in the contract as liable to forfeiture, and that, "There is no ground for holding that
the expression 'contract contains any other stipulation by way of penalty' is limited to cases of
stipulation in the nature of an agreement to pay money or deliver property on breach and does not
comprehend covenants under which amounts paid or property delivered under the contract, which
by the terms of the contract expressly or by clear implication are liable to be forfeited."."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 11Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
22. The Court further held that forfeiture of reasonable amount paid as earnest money does not
amount to imposing a penalty. But if forfeiture is of the nature of penalty, Section 74 of the Contract
Act applies, which reads as follows:-
"74. Compensation for breach of contract where penalty stipulated for.- [When a
contract has been broken, if a sum is named in the contract as the amount to be paid
in case of such breach, or if the contract contains any other stipulation by way of
penalty, the party complaining of the breach is entitled, whether or not actual
damage or loss is proved to have been caused thereby, to receive from the party who
has broken the contract reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so
named or, as the case may be, the penalty stipulated for.
Explanation.- A stipulation for increased interest from the date of default may be a
stipulation by way of penalty. Exception. - When any person enters into any
bail-bond, recognizance or other instrument of the same nature, or, under the
provisions of any law, or under the orders of the [Central Government] or of any
[State Government], gives any bond for the performance of any public duty or act in
which the public are interested, he shall be liable, upon breach of any condition of
any such instrument, to pay the whole sum mentioned therein. Explanation.- A
person who enters into a contract with Government does not necessarily thereby
undertake any public duty, or promise to do an act in which the public are
interested."
23. In Kailash Nath Associates (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:-
"(i) Section 74 of the Contract Act, 1872, is sandwiched between Sections 73 and 75 of
the said Act, which deal with compensation for loss or damage caused by breach of
contract and compensation for damage which a party may sustain through
non-fulfilment of a contract after such party rightfully rescinds such contract.
Compensation is payable for breach of contract under Section 74 of the Contract Act,
1872, only by way of damage or loss is caused by such breach.
(ii) Where a sum is named in a contract as a liquidated amount payable by way of
damages, the party complaining of a breach can receive as reasonable compensation
such liquidated amount only if it is a genuine pre-estimate of damages fixed by both
parties and found to be such by the Court. In other cases, where a sum is named in a
contract as a liquidated amount payable by way of damages, only reasonable
compensation can be awarded not exceeding the amount so stated.
(iii) Reasonable compensation will be fixed on well-known principles that are
applicable to the law of contract, which are to be found, inter alia, in Section 73 of the
Contract Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 12Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
(iv) Since Section 74 awards reasonable compensation for damage or loss caused by a
breach of contract, damage or loss caused is a sine- qua-non for the applicability of
the Section.
(v) Section 74 will apply to cases of forfeiture of earnest money under a contract.
Where, however, forfeiture takes place under the terms and conditions of a public
auction before agreement is reached, Section 74 would have no application.
(Emphasis is mine)
24. In MBL Infrastructure Limited (Supra), a coordinate Bench of this Court was considering the
enforceability of a forfeiture clause in a notice inviting tender. The relevant paragraphs of the said
judgment may be profitably extracted hereunder:-
"1. The issue involved is as to the enforceability of a forfeiture clause in a notice
inviting tender. There is no doubt that the relevant clause provided for the forfeiture
of the earnest deposit if material particulars were found to have not been disclosed by
a tenderer. The legal question which has arisen is whether, upon there being a
material non-disclosure or a material concealment, the forfeiture clause would
become applicable irrespective of the quantum of money sought to be forfeited and
without reference to the nature of inconvenience or the extent of damages suffered by
the party seeking to forfeit.
....
4. Clause 9.4 of Section 1 of the tender terms provided as follows:
"9.4 The Earnest Money is liable to be forfeited
(a) if after bid opening during the period of bid validity or issue of Letter of
Acceptance, whichever is earlier, any tenderer
i) withdraws his tender or
(ii) makes any modification in the terms and conditions of the tender which are not
acceptable to the Employer.
(b) in case any Statement/information/document furnished by the tenderer is found
to be incorrect or false. C) in the case of a successful tenderer, if the tenderer
i) fails to furnish the Performance Guarantee within the period specified under
Clause 1 of "Clauses of Contract".
ii) Fails to commence the work within 15 days after the date of issue of Letter of
Acceptance.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 13Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
In case of forfeiture of E.M. as prescribed here in above, the tenderer shall not be allowed to
participate in the retendering process of the work."
....
6. There is no dispute that when the appellant, through a joint venture with Premco Rail Engineers
Limited, submitted its bid, the appellant furnished a declaration in the prescribed format by way of
an affidavit affirmed on February 10, 2009. On or about July 21, 2009, Rites issued a show-cause
notice to the joint venture bidder that such bidder had suppressed material facts while submitting
its tender and required the bidder to show cause why action should not be taken against it in terms
of Clause 9.4 (c) of Section 1 of the tender documents. It was alleged in such notice that the bidder
had been engaged for the construction of a road between Adityapur and Kandra and for the
widening and strengthening of the Kandra-Saraikella road in 2004-2005 and the contractor was
unable to satisfactorily complete the work which resulted in a sum in excess of Rs. 1.19 crore being
recovered from the contractor after cancelling the agreement. It also alleged that steps had been
taken to blacklist the contractor. Rites claimed that in the light of such previous performance of the
bidder, the declaration furnished by it was false and the earnest money was liable to be forfeited as
per the relevant clause."
25. The Court came to a finding that there was a breach of contract by the bidder in not disclosing a
material fact while submitting its bid. The court referred to the decisions in the cases of Kailash
Nath Associates, (supra) and Fateh Chand, (surpa) and finally the Court came to the following
conclusion:-
"26. In a claim for damages there is first the factum that has to be established before
the quantum of damages can be assessed. When the breach is of the kind as
complained in the present case - of non-disclosure of material facts or concealment
thereof- the extent of damages that may have been suffered would depend on how far
the bid had progressed and at what stage the discovery of the breach was made or at
what stage such discovery could be made upon exercise of ordinary diligence. The
legal issue has to be answered with reference to Sections 73 and 74 of the Act of 1872
and cannot be seen to be beyond the pale of such provisions.
Notwithstanding the stray lines in some of the judgments cited that there may not have been any
concluded contract for Section 74 of the Act of 1872 to come into play, it has already been discussed
above that there was an enforceable agreement in place upon there being a notice inviting tender
and a bid being deposited in terms thereof. The breach is established and unquestionable but it
would not necessarily follow that the breach would result in the entire quantum of the earnest
deposit being forfeited. If such interpretation were to be given, the clause would be penal and fall
foul of Section 74 of the Act.
27. It is, thus, that the quantum of damages suffered has to be assessed with reference to how the
bid was received, how it was processed, the extent to which it progressed, the nature of the work
involved and like factors. It is inconceivable that in processing the bid, the respondents here would
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 14Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
have expended an amount of Rs. 50 lakh or even a substantial part of such amount. It would seem
that it is for such reason that the respondents suggest at paragraph 20 of their affidavit that once the
amount was quantified they were not required to prove the quantum of loss actually suffered.
28. Several principles must be kept in mind while making the assessment. Merely because such a
clause is included in the tender documents does not attach any level of sanctity to it than any other
clause which is required to pass the test of reasonableness in the context in which it is applied. That
a sum is specified as security deposit or earnest deposit does not imply that upon the breach, such
amount is liable to be forfeited and the party forfeiting is entitled to the windfall without there being
any loss or damage suffered by such party. Indeed, that is the exact reasoning in Kailash Nath where
the Court was satisfied that DDA did not suffer any loss since the subsequent auction fetched a price
of more than three times what the previous auction had. If, on the other hand, the subsequent
auction had fetched a lower price, the previous highest bidder could have been proceeded against for
the difference as that would have been the quantum of damages suffered as a consequence of the
previous bidder failing to honour its bid.
31. A balance has to be stuck in every case, when the assessment of the quantum becomes a difficult
or an impossible task; to allow the forfeiture in principle, but to limit the quantum so as not to make
it punitive or extortionist. Indeed, there is always an element of approximation and guesswork
involved in assessing the quantum of damages even after receipt of the best evidence possible. After
all, the Court is trying to put a person in the position as if the breach had not happened, though the
breach has, in fact, happened."
26. Now coming to the decisions relied upon by the respondent Corporation, in the case of Michigan
Rubber (India) Limited v. State of Karnataka & Ors. (Supra), where the Hon'ble Supreme Court was
considering the extent to which a Court should interfere in tender or contractual matters, at
paragraphs 23 and 24 of the reported Judgment it was observed as follows:-
"23. From the above decisions, the following principles emerge:
(a) The basic requirement of Article 14 is fairness in action by the State, and non-arbitrariness in
essence and substance is the heartbeat of fair play. These actions are amenable to judicial review
only to the extent that the State must act validly for a discernible reason and not whimsically for any
ulterior purpose. If the State acts within the bounds of reasonableness, it would be legitimate to take
into consideration the national priorities;
(b) Fixation of a value of the tender is entirely within the purview of the executive and the courts
hardly have any role to play in this process except for striking down such action of the executive as is
proved to be arbitrary or unreasonable. If the Government acts in conformity with certain healthy
standards and norms such as awarding of contracts by inviting tenders, in those circumstances, the
interference by courts is very limited;
(c) In the matter of formulating conditions of a tender document and awarding a contract, greater
latitude is required to be conceded to the State authorities. Unless the action of the tendering
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 15Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
authority is found to be malicious and a misuse of its statutory powers, interference by courts is not
warranted;
(d) Certain preconditions or qualifications for tenders have to be laid down to ensure that the
contractor has the capacity and the resources to successfully execute the work; and
(e) If the State or its instrumentalities act reasonably, fairly and in public interest in awarding
contract, here again, interference by court is very restrictive since no person can claim a
fundamental right to carry on business with the Government.
24. Therefore, a court before interfering in tender or contractual matters, in exercise of power of
judicial review, should pose to itself the following questions:
(i) Whether the process adopted or decision made by the authority is mala fide or
intended to favour someone; or whether the process adopted or decision made is so
arbitrary and irrational that the court can say: "the decision is such that no
responsible authority acting reasonably and in accordance with relevant law could
have reached?" and
(ii) Whether the public interest is affected?
If the answers to the above questions are in the negative, then there should be no interference under
Article 226."
27. In Meerut development Authority, (Supra), the Hon'ble Apex Court while discussing the nature
of rights of a bidder participating in a public tender process at paragraphs 26 to 29 of the reported
judgment, observed as follows:-
"26. A tender is an offer. It is something which invites and is communicated to notify
acceptance. Broadly stated it must be unconditional; must be in the proper form, the
person by whom tender is made must be able to and willing to perform his
obligations. The terms of the invitation to tender cannot be open to judicial scrutiny
because the invitation to tender is in the realm of contract. However, a limited
judicial review may be available in cases where it is established that the terms of the
invitation to tender were so tailor-made to suit the convenience of any particular
person with a view to eliminate all others from participating in the bidding process.
27. The bidders participating in the tender process have no other right except the right to equality
and fair treatment in the matter of evaluation of competitive bids offered by interested persons in
response to notice inviting tenders in a transparent manner and free from hidden agenda. One
cannot challenge the terms and conditions of the tender except on the abovestated ground, the
reason being the terms of the invitation to tender are in the realm of contract. No bidder is entitled
as a matter of right to insist the authority inviting tenders to enter into further negotiations unless
the terms and conditions of notice so provided for such negotiations.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 16Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
28. It is so well settled in law and needs no restatement at our hands that disposal of public property
by the State or its instrumentalities partakes the character of a trust. The methods to be adopted for
disposal of public property must be fair and transparent providing an opportunity to all the
interested persons to participate in the process.
29. The Authority has the right not to accept the highest bid and even to prefer a tender other than
the highest bidder, if there exist good and sufficient reasons, such as, the highest bid not
representing the market price but there cannot be any doubt that the Authority's action in accepting
or refusing the bid must be free from arbitrariness or favouritism."
28. In H.U.D.A and Anr. v. Kewal Krishan Goel & Anr. (supra) the question that fell for
consideration was where a land was allotted and the allottee deposited some instalments but
thereafter intimated the authority about his incapacity to pay up the balance instalments and
requested for refund of the money paid, was the allotting authority entitled to forfeit the earnest
money deposited by the allottee or was it only entitled to forfeit 10 per cent of the total amount
deposited by the allottee till the request was made by him for refund? At paragraph 12 of the
reported judgment the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as follows:-
"12. This being the legal position and the allottee having accepted the allotment and
having made some payment on instalment basis then made the request to surrender
the land, has committed default on his part and therefore the competent authority
would be fully justified in forfeiting the earnest money which had been deposited and
not the 10% of the amount deposited as held by the High Court. The High Court was
totally in error in issuing the direction in question on the ground that the
respondents were not in a position to deliver the possession of the land to the
allottee. It may be stated that in the letter of allotment no period was stipulated
within which the possession of the land was to be delivered. The land in question was
required to be developed and then to be delivered and in the absence of any period in
the letter of allotment, it was required to be delivered within a reasonable period. In
the facts and circumstances, it cannot be said that the reasonability had lapsed
particularly when the allottees had not paid up the entire instalment due and merely
paid a part thereof.
29. In National Highways Authority of India v. Ganga Enterprises & Anr. (supra) the facts were very
similar to the facts of the present case. A notice inviting tenders was issued for collection of toll on a
portion of a particular highway. The notice required the bidder to furnish a bid security in the sum
of Rs. 50 lakh in the form of bank guarantee or bank draft and a performance security in the form of
bank guarantee of Rs. 2 crore. The bid security was liable to forfeiture in case the bidder withdrew
his bid during the validity period of the bid. The bid was to remain valid for a period of 120 days
after the last date of bid submission. The respondent firm furnished a bank guarantee for Rs. 50
lakh. It was an "on-demand bank guarantee" stating that it could be enforced on demand if the
bidder withdrew his bid during the period of bid validity. Before the validity period of the bid ended,
the respondent firm withdrew its bid. The appellant Authority encashed the bank guarantee for Rs.
50 lakh. The respondent firm challenge this by way of a writ petition claiming refund of the amount.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 17Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
The High Court formulated two questions:-(a) Whether the forfeiture of security deposit was
without authority of law and without any binding contract between the parties and also contrary to
Section 5 of the Contract Act? and (b) whether the writ petition was maintainable in a claim arising
out of a breach of contract. The High Court allowed the writ petition without considering the second
question of maintainability.
The Hon'ble Supreme Court allowed the appeal, making the following observations:-
"(a) Thus, it is to be seen that the bid security of Rs. 50 lakh was not for performance
of the contract. It was in the essence and earnest to be given to ensure that the bidder
did not withdraw his bid during the period of bid validity and/or that after
acceptance the performance security is furnished and the agreement signed. The
other terms pertained to the anticipated contract for collection of toll. It must be
mentioned that the bid validity period was 120 days.
(b) ....... Of course, this did not mean that a completed contract in respect of the work
of toll collection had come into existence.
(c) ....... In our view, the answer to Question (b) is clear. It is settled law that disputes
relating to contracts cannot be agitated under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
It has been so held in the cases of Kerala SEB v. Kurien E. Kalathil, State of U.P v.
Bridge & Roof Co. (India) Ltd. and Bareilly Development Authority v.
Ajai Pal Singh. This is settled law. The dispute in this case was regarding the terms of offer. They
were thus contractual disputes in respect of which a writ court was not the proper forum. Mr. Dav,
however, relied upon the cases of Verigamto Naveen v. Government of A.P. & Harminder Singh
Arora v. Union of India. These, however, are cases where the writ court was enforcing a statutory
right or duty. These cases do not lay down that a writ court can interfere in a matter of contract only.
Thus, on the ground of maintainability of the petition should have been dismissed.
(d) In our view, the High Court fell in error in not so holding. By invoking the bank guarantee
and/or enforcing the bid security, there is no statutory right, exercise of which was being fettered.
There is no term in the contract which is contrary to the provisions of the Indian Contract Act. The
Indian Contract Act merely provides that a person can withdraw his offer before its acceptance. But
withdrawal of an offer, before it is accepted, is a completely different aspect from forfeiture of
earnest/security money which has been given for a particular purpose. A person may have a right to
withdraw his offer but if he has made his offer on a condition that some earnest money will be
forfeited for not entering into contract or if some act is not performed, then even though he may
have a right to withdraw his offer, he has no right to claim that the earnest/security be returned to
him. Forfeiture of such earnest/security, in no way, affects any statutory right under the Indian
Contract Act. Such earnest/security is given and taken to ensure that a contract comes into
existence. It would be an anomalous situation that a person who, by his own conduct, precludes the
coming into existence of the contract is then given advantage or benefit of his own wrong by not
allowing forfeiture. It must be remembered that, particularly in government contracts, such a term
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 18Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
is always included in order to ensure that only a genuine party makes a bid. If such a term was not
there even a person who does not have the capacity or a person who has no intention of entering
into the contract will make a bid. The whole purpose of such a clause i.e. to see that only genuine
bids are received would be lost if forfeiture was not permitted." (Emphasis is mine).
30. From the aforesaid decisions, the following principles of law emerge:-
(a) Section 74 of the Contract Act imposes a duty on the courts not to enforce a
penalty clause but only to award reasonable compensation in case of breach of
contract.
(b) Forfeiture of reasonable amount paid as earnest money does not amount to
imposing a penalty.
(c) Where a sum of money is stipulated in a contract as payable by way of damages in case of breach
of contract, the party complaining of breach can receive such named amount only if it is a genuine
pre-estimate of damages fixed by both parties and found to be such by the Court. In other cases,
where a sum is named in a contract as a liquidated amount payable by way of damages, only
reasonable compensation can be awarded not exceeding the stipulated amount.
(d) Section 74 of the Contract Act will apply to cases of forfeiture of earnest money under a contract.
However, if forfeiture takes place in accordance with the terms and conditions of a public auction
before agreement is reached, Section 74 would have no application.
(e) In the matter of formulating conditions of a tender document and awarding a contract, greater
latitude needs to be conceded to the State Authorities unless the tendering Authority's action is
found to be malicious and misuse of its statutory powers.
(f) The Court will be slow to interfere with the terms and conditions of a public tender. Generally the
terms of invitation to tender are not open to judicial scrutiny because the same are in the realm of
contract.
(g) A tender is an offer. An invitation to tender is an invitation to the members of the public to make
an offers to the tendering authority. A contract comes into existence upon the authority accepting
the offer of the successful tenderer. Earnest money is taken from a tenderer to ensure that he does
not withdraw his bid during the period of validity of the bid.
(h) earnest/security money is taken to ensure that a contract comes into existence. It would be
anomalous if a person who, by his own conduct, precludes the coming into existence of the contract,
is then given the advantage or benefit of his own wrong by not allowing forfeiture.
(i) Particularly, in Government contracts, a forfeiture clause is always included to ensure that only a
genuine party makes a bid. If such a term is not there, even a person not having the capacity or not
having the intention of entering into the contract, would be free to make a bid. The whole object i.e.,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 19Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
to see that only genuine bids are received, would be defeated if forfeiture is not permitted.
31. The facts of the present case have been noted in the first few paragraphs of this judgment. The
appellant submitted its bid on September 8, 2016. The bid was to remain valid for 120 days i.e., till
January 6, 2017. The appellant extended the validity of the bid for 4 months as recorded by it in a
letter dated December 27, 2016. In such letter, there was an obvious error in stating that the validity
of the tender stood extended till January 9, 2017. Extension of 4 months would mean that the bid
would be valid till May 5, 2017. By a letter dated February 23, 2017, the appellant claimed refund of
the earnest money deposit. In the letter he categorically stated that it would be extremely difficult to
execute the work as the rate that had been quoted is no longer workable. Further, by his letter dated
April 12, 2017, the material portion whereof has been extorted in paragraph 11 of this judgment, the
appellant made it abundantly clear that he had withdrawn his offer. In my view, by the letters the
appellant withdrew his bid. Since the appellant did so before the validity period of the bid expired,
Clause 13 of the tender notice came into play entitling the respondent Corporation to forfeit the
earnest money deposit.
32. Learned Counsel for the appellant argued that the first time that the appellant evinced its
intention to withdraw from the bid was on May 24, 2017 which was beyond the validity period of the
bid. By a letter of that date the appellant stated that the tender stands cancelled. I am unable to
agree with learned Advocate for the appellant. In my opinion, the letter dated February 23, 2017,
which was written by the appellant to the respondent Corporation unequivocally indicates that the
appellant withdrew the bid as otherwise he could not have claimed refund of the earnest money
deposit.
33. Section 74 of the Contract Act comes into play only when there is a concluded contract and a
breach thereof. It is elementary that for a legally enforceable contract to come into existence, there
must be an offer, an acceptance of the offer by another person, consideration must pass and there
must be an intention on the part of the contracting parties to create a legal relation. Once an offer is
accepted and the other two elements are also present, a contract stands concluded which law may
enforce.
34. The bid put in by the appellant was an offer given by it to execute the subject work at the quoted
rates on the terms and conditions mentioned in the tender documents. Such offer was never
accepted by the respondent corporation overtly by issuing letter of acceptance or otherwise. Hence,
no concluded contract ever came into being. Therefore, Section 74 of the Contract Act would not
have any manner of application as that provision of law deals with the measure of damages in case
of breach of contract.
35. In MBL Infrastructure Limited (supra), a coordinate Bench observed that though the primary
objective of a tender process was to indentify a person who would be awarded the contract, upon a
person inviting tenders and another person making a bid pursuant thereto, there is an agreement in
place. The Bench went on to hold that the appellant by not disclosing a material fact was clearly in
breach of such agreement. However, the entire earnest money could not be forfeited as Section 74 of
the Contract Act would determine the quantum of compensation payable to the tendering
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 20Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
authorities. Notice of the Coordinate Bench was not drawn to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Meerut Development Authority (supra) wherein the Supreme Court has clarified
that a tender is an offer. Only upon an acceptance thereof a concluding contract will come into
existence. In my respectful opinion, the observation of the Coordinate Bench that upon a bid being
put in by a person an agreement comes into being, is not in consonance with the dicta of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the Meerut Development Authority case. Of course, the Coordinate Bench did not
have the occasion to consider that case. None the less, the opinion of the Coordinate Bench that a
contract/agreement is formed as soon as a tenderer puts in his bid, is per incurium.
36. I also note that in the case of National Highways Authority of India v. Ganga Enterprises
(supra), the material facts whereof were almost identical with the facts of the present case, the
Supreme Court held that a claim for refund of earnest money which had been forfeited by the
tendering authority upon the tenderer withdrawing his bid during the validity period of the tender,
was a contractual dispute for adjudication of which a writ court is not the proper forum. The
Supreme Court further observed that withdrawal of an offer before the same is accepted, is a totally
different aspect from forfeiture of earnest money which has been given for a particular purpose. A
person may have the right to withdraw his offer but if the offer has been made on a condition that
the earnest money will be forfeited if the bid is withdrawn within the validity period thereof, he has
not right to claim that the earnest money be returned to him.
37. Accordingly I find no infirmity in the judgment and order assailed before us. The appeal
accordingly fails and is dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.
38. Urgent certified website copy of this judgment, if applied for, be supplied to the parties upon
compliance of necessary formalities.
(Arijit Banerjee, J.) Kausik Chanda, J.:-
1. I have had the privilege of perusing the draft judgment prepared by my esteemed senior brother,
Arijit Banerjee, J. It is indeed a delight to read a judgment authored by him, owing to his
unparalleled ability to articulate and convey intricate legal concepts with a clear and forceful
narrative.
2. However, I regret that I am unable to concur with the perspective put forth by my esteemed
colleague in this particular instance.
3. The facts of the case have been succinctly delineated by my esteemed senior colleague in his
verdict. While it is not necessary to reiterate the same, I deem it appropriate to highlight certain
supplementary factual aspects which, in my opinion, hold relevance.
4. It is worth noting that the tender in question was issued with the following date and time
schedule.

6. Though the bid was opened on September 13, 2016, and the appellant turned out to be the lowest
bidder, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (in short, the Corporation) did not issue any work order
accepting the bid of the appellant.
7. It appears that after about expiry of about two and half months from the bid opening date, the
appellant wrote a letter dated November 28, 2016, to the Director General of the Corporation to
convey the following message.
"Ref: EE/KMC/GK/001 Date: 28.11.2016 To The Director General(S&D), The Kolkata Municipal
Corporation, Kolkata.
Ref: CONSTRUCTION OF UNDER GROUND DRAINAGE SYSTEM ON P.C CONNECTOR FROM

Dear Sir, It is seen from the competitive statement after opening of the tender that we stand as
lowest bidder.
Accordingly, the undersigned contacted the D.G (S&D) and the issue of acceptance was discussed.
We now give our willingness to extend validity of our rate for another 4 months as desired please.
Thanking you, Yours faithfully, Sd/- Illegible Santanu Mukherjee (Proprietor)"
8. The appellant, therefore, only expressed its "willingness to extend the validity of its rate for
another four months." Nevertheless, the Corporation did not provide consent to this proposal and
there is nothing on record to suggest that such "willingness" was ever accepted by the Corporation.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 23Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
9. In its next letter dated December 27, 2016, the appellant approached the Corporation for early
acceptance of tender ahead of the monsoon season. In that letter, the appellant also noted as
follows:- "Now we have extend the validity of the tender for another 4 months i.e upto 09 Jan 17 as
per the direction of the DG (S&D)." The said letter was also not replied to by the Corporation.
10. The appellant again wrote another letter to the Corporation on February 2, 2017, in which it was
again indicated that the validity period of the bid submitted by him expired on January 9, 2017. The
relevant part of the said letter is quoted below:
"Ref: EE/KMC/GK/003 Date: 02.02.2017

Dear Sir,
Please refer to our earlier letter No
EE/KMC/GK/002 dt. 27.12.2016 (copy
enclosed).
From the date of floating the tender i.e.
08/02/2016 it is observed that it may not be
having enough priority to get the job done by the department. Had there been any interest for the
tender, the department would have settled it long back.
It is prudent to mention here that we had been asked to extend the validity of tender being LT, for 4
months which also has already expired on 09 Jan 2017.
At this juncture, please let us know what should be our next course of action.
Thanking You, Yours faithfully, Sd/- Illegible Santanu Mukherjee (Proprietor) Copy to : Director
General, (S&D), KMC."
The Corporation did not provide any response to this letter as well.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 24Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
11. Thereafter, by a letter dated February 23, 2017, the appellant requested to refund of the earnest
money within seven days. The relevant part of the said letter is quoted below:
"...Since then we have been pursuing with the Deptt. for acceptance of the tender.
However, later on at the direction of the D.G. (S&D), we extended the validity of our
quoted rate for further 4 months, which eventually expired on 09 Jan 17.
We had expressed our concern vide our above quoted letter over the decision of your
deptt. regarding acceptance of the tender, as we were very much keen to undertake
the job as early as possible.
It now appears, the deptt. is not at all keen to place the necessary Work Order on us
to execute the work. May be the job is no longer in your priority list.
In the circumstances stated above, it is requested to refund our EMD within seven
days as we do not envisage the job will be at all awarded to us in future inspite of
being qualified for the job. Moreover it would be extremely difficult to execute the
work at the moment as the rate which we quoted an year ago is no longer workable.
..."
12. Though the said letters mentions that "at the direction of the DG (S&D)" the appellant extended
the validity of the rate for further four months, no letter or communication either by the appellant or
from the Corporation was ever placed before the Court to demonstrate such direction.
13. The request for a refund of earnest money was, thereafter, repeated by the appellant in its letter
dated May 24, 2017, November 16, 2017, May 25, 2018, and October 31, 2018. The Corporation did
not bother to make any response.
14. Ultimately, this writ petition was filed on or about December 12, 2018, seeking a refund of the
earnest money of Rs.11,99,536/-. Only thereafter, by a letter dated December 14, 2018, did the
Corporation inform the appellant that the earnest money deposited by the appellant had been
forfeited as per instruction of the Special Secretary, Government of West Bengal. It is noteworthy
that this is the only communication that the Corporation made to the appellant in approximately
about two years and three months since the opening of the bid on September 13, 2016.
15. Before delving into the legal issues as discussed by my learned senior brother in his judgment, it
is essential to address the crucial question of when the validity period of the relevant bid has expired
in the facts of the case.
16. Learned Single Judge in the impugned judgment has held that 120 days from the last date of
submission of the financial bid expired on January 6, 2017. The appellant by the letter dated
November 28, 2016, extended the validity period by a further period of four months and four
months from January 6, 2017, which expired on May 6, 2017. The appellant sought for a refund
before May 6, 2017, which was within the extended validity period of the bid, which clearly showed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 25Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
the intention of the appellant not to perceive or proceed with the tender. The forfeiture clause was a
condition for the notice of tender and the appellant was bound to accept the same the moment it
participated in the tender. The consequence of forfeiture from the language of the clause followed
immediately and automatically.
17. My esteemed senior brother noted that the appellant extended the validity period for four
months as recorded in the letter dated December 27, 2016. However, there was an obvious error in
the letter stating that the validity of the tender was extended till January 9, 2017. The extension of
four months meant that the bid would remain valid till May 5, 2017.
18. I am of the view that in the present case, there was no extension of validity of period the bid in
the eyes law.
19. The letter dated November 28, 2016, of the appellant merely expressed his willingness to extend
the validity of his bid for another four months. Significantly, in all subsequent letters starting from
December 27, 2016, to October 31, 2018, which was the last letter preceding this writ petition, the
appellant maintained that validity of the bid expired after January 9, 2017. In my view, the said date
has not been mentioned due to an error.
20. The tender notice quoted above clearly suggests that the last date of online bid submission was
September 8, 2016, up to 2 p.m., and the last date of offline submission of earnest money deposit
was September 10, 2016, up to 2 p.m. The appellant appears to have calculated 120 days from
September 11, 2016 (excluding the last date of submission of earnest money) and concluded that the
bid was valid only up to January 9, 2017. The appellant never indicated its intention to extend the
validity period of the bid beyond January 9, 2017.
21. The appellant's stand in its different letters as mentioned above regarding the extension of the
bid's validity period can be interpreted in three possible ways.
a) The appellant may have requested an extension of the validity period for a duration of four
months from November 28, 2016, which is the date on which the willingness for an extension was
expressed.
b) The appellant may have intended to extend the validity period up to January 9, 2017, which is
consistent with the appellant's stand in all correspondences addressed to the Corporation.
c) The appellant may have sought to extend the validity period until May 6, 2017, as noted by both
the learned Single Judge and my esteemed senior brother.
22. The fact remains that the appellant's willingness to extend the validity of the bid for another four
months was never accepted by the Corporation. In absence of any written communication from the
end of the Corporation regarding the extension of the validity period, the terms of the tender could
not have been altered. There is nothing on record to show that at any point of time, the Corporation
had any intention to extend the validity period of the bid.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 26Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
23. When the Corporation floated a tender, it made a representation before the public and after
floating the tender, the Corporation was not entitled to alter any of the terms and conditions of the
tender, particularly, when the Corporation did not reserve its right to make any such alteration.
24. The alteration of the validity period of a bid as indicated in the tender notice cannot be a
unilateral action at the instance of the bidder. At no point of time, before the writ petition was filed,
did the Corporation expressly or even by its implied act accept the proposal to extend the validity
period of the bid. It bears repetition that no communication whatsoever from the end of the
Corporation was produced to show its intention to extend the validity period of the bid. Therefore,
the Corporation by way of an afterthought cannot take a stand in its affidavit that the validity period
of the bid was extended by four months when in fact, there was no extension of the validity period of
the bid in the eyes of law.
25. The aforesaid proposition of law is an elementary one. Nevertheless, should any authority be
required, reference may be made to the judgment of the Supreme Court dealing with a case of
unilateral alteration of the terms of a tender reported at (2017) 16 SCC 757 (Suresh Kumar Wadhwa
v. State of Madhya Pradesh). The relevant paragraphs of the said report are quoted below:
"26. Equally well-settled principle of law relating to contract is that a party to the
contract can insist for performance of only those terms/conditions, which are part of
the contract. Likewise, a party to the contract has no right to unilaterally "alter" the
terms and conditions of the contract and nor they have a right to "add" any additional
terms/conditions in the contract unless both the parties agree to add/alter any such
terms/conditions in the contract.
27. Similarly, it is also a settled law that if any party adds any additional
terms/conditions in the contract without the consent of the other contracting party
then such addition is not binding on the other party. Similarly, a party, which adds
any such term/condition, has no right to insist on the other party to comply with such
additional terms/conditions and nor such party has a right to cancel the contract on
the ground that the other party has failed to comply with such additional
terms/conditions."
26. I am of the view that the bid validity period was never extended beyond four months from the
last date of submission of the bid (whether it was September 8 or September 10, 2016). The
appellant was entitled to a refund of the earnest money on February 23, 2017, which was the date of
its first letter seeking a refund since the validity period of the bid had already expired by then.
27. Moving on to the next question as to the applicability of Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act,
1872, two different views taken by the Supreme Court Bench of equal strength must be noticed. A
Two Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in National Highways Authority of India v. Ganga
Enterprises reported at (2003) 7 SCC 410 dealt with the issue of forfeiture of earnest money. In that
case, during the validity period of the bid, the bidder withdrew its bid for which the tendering
authority forfeited the earnest money deposited by way of a bank guarantee. The High Court held

since the bid of the appellant was not accepted, there was no completed contract between the parties
and there could be no breach of contract until the offer is accepted unconditionally, it creates no
legal right and the bid can be withdrawn at any point of time. The Supreme Court set aside the
judgment of the High Court and held as follows:-
"3. In terms of this tender document the respondent gave his bid or offer. The
offer/bid was in terms of the tender and thus it was also in two parts, the first part
being an offer that the bid would not be withdrawn during the bid validity period
and/or that on acceptance the performance security would be furnished and the
agreement signed. The second part of the offer dealt with the terms and conditions
pertaining to the performance of the contract of collection of tolls, if the offer was
accepted. As earnest/security for performance (of the first part of the offer), the
respondent along with his bid furnished a bank guarantee in a sum of Rs 50 lakhs as
bid security. The bank guarantee furnished was an "on-demand guarantee" which
specifically provided that the bank guarantee could be enforced "on demand" if the
bidder withdraws his bid during the period of bid validity or if the bidder, having
been notified of the acceptance of his bids, fails to furnish the performance security
or fails to sign the agreement. The amount of the bank guarantee was to be paid by
the bank without demur on a written demand merely stating that one of these
conditions had been fulfilled. The moment the bank guarantee was given and
accepted by the appellants the first portion of the offer, regarding bid security, stood
accepted. Of course, this did not mean that a completed contract in respect of the
work of toll collection had come into existence."
[emphasis is supplied by me] [
28. The Supreme Court, in this case, allowed to forfeit the earnest money on the ground that the
same was deposited by way of bank guarantee and the Court can only interfere if the invocation is
against the terms of the guarantee or if there is any fraud. The relevant paragraph of the said
judgment is quoted below:
"10. There is another reason why the impugned judgment cannot be sustained. It is
settled law that a contract of guarantee is a complete and separate contract by itself.
The law regarding enforcement of an "on-demand bank guarantee" is very clear. If
the enforcement is in terms of the guarantee, then courts must not interfere with the
enforcement of bank guarantee. The court can only interfere if the invocation is
against the terms of the guarantee or if there is any fraud. Courts cannot restrain
invocation of an "on-demand guarantee" in accordance with its terms by looking at
terms of the underlying contract. The existence or non- existence of an underlying
contract becomes irrelevant when the invocation is in terms of the bank guarantee.
The bank guarantee stipulated that if the bid was withdrawn within 120 days or if the
performance security was not given or if an agreement was not signed, the guarantee
could be enforced. The bank guarantee was enforced because the bid was withdrawn
within 120 days.

Therefore, it could not be said that the invocation of the bank guarantee was against
the terms of the bank guarantee. If it was in terms of the bank guarantee, one fails to
understand as to how the High Court could say that the guarantee could not have
been invoked. If the guarantee was rightly invoked, there was no question of directing
refund as has been done by the High Court."
29. The aforesaid judgment of the Supreme Court makes the position of law clear that a forfeiture
clause is a complete and separate contract by itself, even if there is no concluded contract in respect
of the work order of the tender in question. The moment earnest money is deposited by a bidder and
accepted by the tenderer, the offer as to the submission of the bid stands accepted and in such an
event, the existence of a concluded contract with regard to the underlying contract i.e. the contract
for execution of work becomes irrelevant.
30. It must be noticed that the said judgment was delivered in a factual context where the earnest
money was deposited by a bank guarantee and in the said case despite noticing a contract between
the parties, the Supreme Court had no occasion to consider the implication of Section 74 of the
Indian Contract Act, 1872, as against a forfeiture clause.
31. The issue of applicability of Section 74, however, as noticed by my learned senior brother, was
answered in negative in the judgment reported at (2015) 4 SCC 136 (Kailash Nath Associates v.
Delhi Development Authority). The relevant paragraph is quoted below:
"43.7. Section 74 will apply to cases of forfeiture of earnest money under a contract.
Where, however, forfeiture takes place under the terms and conditions of a public
auction before agreement is reached, Section 74 would have no application."
32. Significantly, in the said judgment the Supreme Court directed a refund of the earnest money as
it found the existence of a concluded contract between the parties involved.
33. The view expressed in the judgment reported at AIR 2020 Cal 155 (MBL Infrastructure Limited
v. Rites Limited) seems to align with the view expressed in the National Highways Authority of India
(supra) insofar as it relates to the issue of the existence of a concluded contract in relation to a
forfeiture clause.
34. The argument advanced on behalf of the Corporation in this case with regard to the scope of
interference by a writ Court in a contractual matter appears to be self-destructive. If there is no
concluded contract between the parties in the facts of the present case, then the question of
limitation of a writ Court to interfere in a contractual matter becomes irrelevant. Bereft of any
contract between the parties, like any other administrative action, the act of arbitrary forfeiture of
earnest money by the Corporation becomes a subject of judicial review by a writ Court.
35. The Corporation in this case never extended the bid validity period. It did not even forfeit the
earnest money before filing the writ petition. The action of the Corporation, therefore, to forfeit the
earnest money after the validity period of the bid cannot be sustained. Even if, it is assumed that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/76348790/ 29Essem Enterprise vs Kolkata Municipal Corporation & ... on 5 April, 2023
there was no concluded contract between the parties, the Corporation should be allowed to forfeit
the earnest money only proportionate to the damages or losses suffered by it due to the withdrawal
of the bid by the appellant. A writ Court should not be hesitant to apply the principles of Section 74
of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 as elucidated in Fateh Chand v. Balkishan Dass, reported at (1964)
1 SCR 515, even in the absence of a concluded contract between the parties and allow a party to
forfeit the amount proportionate to the damages suffered by it. The Corporation has not established
a case to demonstrate any losses suffered. The Corporation's approach to the tender process cannot
be condoned. Following the relevant tender, it received the appellant's lowest bid, on September 10,
2016, it accepted the earnest money deposited by the appellant yet failed to take any further action
for approximately two and a half years. Furthermore, the Corporation neglected to respond to any of
the appellant's letters. It was only when the appellant filed a writ petition to reclaim the earnest
money, the Corporation forfeited the same. In light of these facts, it is evident that only the
appellant has suffered losses and damages due to the procrastination of the Corporation.
36. I respectfully concur with the view expressed by my learned senior brother regarding
competence of the writ petitioner to maintain the writ petition.
37. In view of the discussion above, I am inclined to allow the appeal and direct the Corporation to
refund the earnest money together with an interest @ 7 % per annum to be calculated from February
23, 2017, i.e. the date when the appellant first asked for a refund of the earnest money, till the date
of actual payment.
38. Urgent certified website copy of this judgment, if applied for, be supplied to the parties upon
compliance with necessary formalities.
(Kausik Chanda, J.) The Court:- Since there is a difference of opinion between two of us, let this
matter be placed before the Hon'ble the Acting Chief Justice for appropriate direction.
