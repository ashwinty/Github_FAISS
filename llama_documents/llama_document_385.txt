JUDGMENT Meena, J.
1. Since this appeal and two writ petitions are inter-connected, we heard and dispose of them by this
common order.
2. This reference has been made to the Larger Bench by the Division Bench vide order dated
22.3.2001 in the case State of Raj. v. Shyam Sunder Gupta (1) and Surendra Singh v. State of Raj.
and Ors. (2). In both cases similar issues have been raised. One more case has been tagged i.e. RHJS
Officers Association and Ors. v. State of Rajasthan (3). Following questions are referred to this
Larger Bench:-
1. Whether .President, consumer Forum gets salary of a District Judge?
2. If a person already in service is appointed as President, Consumer Forum, he will continue to get
the same salary till he reaches the age of superannuation provided under the Rajasthan Higher
Judicial Service Rules?
3. After date of retirement from the Higher Judicial Service's, if the person still continues as
President of the Consumer forum to complete the tenure provided under the Act, whether he will
continue to get the same salary last drawn by him or usual salary of a District Judge plus the pension
for which he was otherwise entitled for after his due retirement as member of Higher Judicial
Services?
4. During the tenure as President of Consumer Forum whether a person can be treated as member
of Higher Judicial Services even after he reaches the age of superannuation so as to entitle him to all
the benefits of services for the remaining period of his tenure as President, Consumer Forum?
5. Whether there can be any re-employment of President, Consumer Forum during the fixed tenure,
if the person appointed as President while in service, after his retirement from the services?
6. What is the status of a member of RHJS who is appointed as President. District Forum while in
the RHJS and continuing as such after his superannuation in the RHJS?
7. whether aforesaid appointment of a member of RHJS at any stage can be reckoned as
"re-employment" or whether it is to be held as "statutory appointment"?
3. The facts in case of Shyam Sunder Gupta are that Shyam Sunder Gupta was appointed as
President of Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, Sikar vide order dated 2.6.1994 by the Food and
Civil Supply Department Government of Rajasthan under the provisions of Section 10(1) of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784286/ 1State Of Rajasthan And Ors. vs Shyam Sunder Gupta And Ors. on 7 April, 2003
consumer Protection Act, 1986 (hereinafter called as, 'The Act, 1986'. The petitioner was relieved by
the Rajasthan High Court vide its order dated 18.6.1994 to join his new place of posting as President
of the District Consumer Forum, Sikar. In compliance of the said order, the petitioner joined on the
said post on 18.6.1994. since then the petitioner had been working continuously on the said post till
filing of the writ petition. The appointment as President of the District Consumer Forum was for a
term of five years of upto the age of 65 years, whichever is earlier. The petitioner had completed his
age of superannuation in RHJS i.e. 60 years, as a member of the Rajasthan Higher Judicial Services
on 31.5.1995. The Government of Rajasthan sanctioned gross pension as Rs. 3,050/- and net
pension as Rs. 2,034/- vide orderdated 19.2.1996.
4. As the petitioner has retired on 31.5.1995 from RHJS and he became eligible to get pension of a
retired judicial officer, the petitioner claimed that he should be allowed to get District Judges salary
plus pension which he was getting on his superannuation from RHJS on 31.5.1995. In order dated
19.2.1996, the Government has ordered that Shyam Sunder Gupta will continue to act as President
of the Consumer Forum but as he retired from the RHJS on 1.6.1995, therefore, thereafter he will
get the salary as per Rule 337 of the Rajasthan Service Rules, 1951 and vide order dated 14.6.1996
(Annex.5) it is made clear that he will get the salary of District Judge which he was getting on the
date of retirement minus the amount of pension and he will get the medical facilities only which is
permissible to the retired persons. He will also not get the office maintenance allowance. Both the
orders were challenged by Shri Shyam Sunder Gupta claiming that once he was appointed as
President of the District Forum while he was in RHJS, his facilities and perks and pay cannot be
reduced or put him in disadvantageous position then he had a status and position while he was in
Rajasthan higher Judicial Service till his retirement from the Consumer Forum.
5. The case of Shri Surendra Singh was that the petitioner was a member of the Rajasthan Higher
Judicial Services in the year 1994 and posted as Judge, Family Court, Kota. At that time he was
offered the post of President of District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum. The Government vide
order dated 2.6.1994 has appointed him as President of Consumer Forum. He joined on that post on
4.7.1994. The petitioner retired from RHJS on 30.6.1996 but continued to draw the salary and
allowances which he was drawing before retirement in addition to the pension which he got on his
superannuation from RHJS. On 23.8.1996, the respondent issued an order asking him to draw the
salary in accordance with Rule 337 of the Rajasthan Service Rules, 1951.
6. The petitioner Claimed that wen the petitioner had not been re-appointed on his retirement from
RHJS, the provision of Rule 337 of Rajasthan Services Rules, 1951 had no application. The petitioner
also claimed benefit of Revised Pay Scale Rules, 1998 on the basis that when the petitioner had not
retired prior to 30.6.1996, he should get the benefit of Revised Pay Scale Rules, which are revised
after his retirement from the RHJS but before the retired from District Consumer Forum. The
prayer of Shri Singh had been rejected. He challenged that order and claimed that as his case is not
of re-employment and he continued in District Consumer Forum on the date of revised rules made
effective, he is entitled for Revised Pay Scale Rules, 1998.
7. The petitioner challenged the order dated 22.7.1998 (Annex.7) and order dated 22.7.1998
(Annex.8), whereby the earlier fixation order has been cancelled taking the view that after
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784286/ 2State Of Rajasthan And Ors. vs Shyam Sunder Gupta And Ors. on 7 April, 2003
retirement from RHJS, the Petitioner cannot get the benefit of Revised Pay Scale Rules, 1998. The
Petitioner claimed that even after retirement from RHJS, he be treated in Rajasthan Higher Judicial
Service having the same benefit as available to the RHJS as he joined the Forum while he was in
Rajasthan Higher Judicial Services.
8. The third writ petition has been filed by the RHJS Officers Association. In this writ petition, the
petitioners are officers of Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service Association; Jagpal Singh, RHJS
Officers claimed that if any Judicial Officer from Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service joined the
Consumer Forum while in Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service and if he retired during the tenure of
Consumer Forum, he should have the same benefit till his retirement from the Consumer Forum as
are available to the members of Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service even though he retired from
RHJS during the tenure of President of District Consumer Forum.
9. The petitioners Jagpal singh and Usman AH Khan also have the same case. They were appointed
as President of Consumer Forum wile they were member of Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service for 5
years or 65 years, whichever is earlier. Before completion of the tenure as President of the District
Consumer Forum, they are superannuated from the Rajasthan Higher Judicial Services and got all
the retiral benefits but claimed that till their retirement as President, District Consumer Forum,
they are entitled for all the benefits which are available to the member of the Rajasthan Higher
Judicial Services.
10. This reference has been made to the Larger Bench as there was a diversion of opinions of
different benches of this Court and also the view of Kerala High Court supporting the view taken by
the learned Single Judge of this Court.
11. The basic issue in these question is whether the officer of Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service if
appointed as President of District Consumer Forum, while he was in Rajasthan Higher Judicial
Service and, if he retires from RHJS, before completion of 5 years in the District Consumer Forum,
should he be treated as member of Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service or whether he is entitled for all
the benefits of member of RHJS till the retires from the District Consumer Forum.
12. Before we proceed, we would like to refer some relevant provisions of Rajasthan Consumer
Protection Act, 1986 and the Rajasthan consumer Protection Rules, 1987. (hereinafter, referred as
'the Rules, 1987').
13. Clause (a) of Sub-section 1 of Section 10 provides that each District Forum shall consist of a
person who is, or who has been, or is qualified to be a District Judge, who shall be its President.
Sub-section (2) of Section 10 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (hereinafter, referred as 'Act,
1986') provides that every member of the District Forum shall hold office for a term of five years or
upto the age of 65 years, whichever is earlier and he shall not be eligible for re-employment.
Sub-section (3) of Section 10 provides that the salary of honorarium and other allowances payable
to, and the other terms and conditions of service of the members of the District Forum shall be such
as may be prescribed by the State Government.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784286/ 3State Of Rajasthan And Ors. vs Shyam Sunder Gupta And Ors. on 7 April, 2003
14. The power to make rules has been given under Section 30 of the Act, 1986. Rules are framed
Under Section 30 of the Act, 1986. Sub-rule (1) of Rule 3 of the Consumer Protection Rules, 1987
(hereinafter, referred as 'Rules, 1987') pertains to salary and other allowances and terms and
conditions of the President and Members of the District Forum, which provides that the President of
the District Forum shall, receive the salary of the Judge of a District Court, if appointed on part-time
basis or an honorarium of Rs. 150/- per day, if appointed on whole-time basis. Sub-rule (2) of Rule 3
of Rules, 1987 provides the salary, honorarium and other allowances shall be defrayed out of the
Consolidated Fund of the State Government. Sub-rule (6) of Rule 3 of Rules, 1987 further provides
that the terms and conditions of the service of the President and the members of the District Forum
shall not be varied to their disadvan-taged during their tenure of office.
15. The Rules are not happily drafted. These rules provide that President of District Consumer
Forum will receive the salary of a Judge of District Court,. RHJS officers who can be posted as
District Judge, District Judge has a particular pay scale and what amount of salary he will get, that
depend upon how senior he is, in service. Therefore, salary of Judge in District Court varied. Thus,
what amount of salary an officer will get when he will be appointed, that depend how senior he is in
service. Not only that even there is not provision in the Rules as to what will be the salary of the
President of District Consumer Forum on or from the date of his superannuation from RHJS for the
rest of the period of his tenure as President of District Consumer Forum.
16. Therefore, we have to take the harmonious construction of the Rules and infer the intention of
the Legislature and also to consider whether Rule 337 of the Rajasthan Service Rules is applicable
on his superannuation from his Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service, what salary he will get as
President of District Consumer Forum from the date of retirement from RHJS.
17. Rule 337 of Rajaslhan Service Rules, 1951 provides pay of re-employed pensioners i.e. in case any
retired employee is re- employed, what he will get. Whether he can get the pension in addition to
pay or whether he will get pay after deduction of the pension amount.
18. Before we go into the issues in these cases, we would like to refer some decisions of this Court
and the decisions of their Lordships of the Supreme Court.
19. In S.S. Gupta v. State of Rajasthan (4), the learned Single Judge of this Court has taken the view
that Rules 337 of Rajasthan Services Rules, 1951 has no application and in view of Sub-rule (6) of
Rule 3 of Consumer Protection (Rajasthan) Rules, 1987, the RHJS Officer who joined as President,
District Consumer Forum for 5 years but retired from RHJS before completion of 5 years, the
pension should not be deducted from his salary. In para 7, this Court has observed as under:-
"The rule clearly lays down that the President of the District consumer Forum, is entitled to the full
salary payable to a Judge of a District Court and to interpret this rule so as to infer that the
President would entitled to his pension plus the balance amount of the salary of a District Judge
amounts to twisted reading of rule in this regard, in my opinion, it may further be noted that
Sub-rule (6) of Rule 3 also clearly lays down that the terms and conditions of the service of the
President and member of the be varied to their disadvantage during the tenure of office, which also
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784286/ 4State Of Rajasthan And Ors. vs Shyam Sunder Gupta And Ors. on 7 April, 2003
clearly protects the right of the petitioner since he has been receiving the full salary of the President
of a District Consumer Forum ever since he joined it and an order deducting it by applying Rule 337
of the R.S.R., 1951 was passed only at a later stage on 19.2.1996 and 14.6.1996 completely ignoring
Sub-rule (6) of Rule 3, referred to hereinabove. While the petitioner is functioning as a full time
President of the District Consumer Forum for a period of five years, which is going to expire only on
17.6.1999, the rules applicable to a retired District Judge cannot be applied to a full time president of
the District Consumer Forum so as to justify the impugned order to the effect that dearness
allowances, city compensatory allowance and other allowances payable to the petitioner only on the
salary after deducting the amount of pension. I also find no jurisdiction in denying him officiating
allowance, car-allowance and other allowances by treating him a retired District Judge by retired
District Judge by applying Rule 337 of RSR, 1951, since the petitioner's appointment has been made
in terms of a clear provision under the Consumer Protection Act regarding which there are clear
rules pertaining to the salary and terms and conditions is also precluded from varying it to the
disadvantage of the President during the tenure of his office. In may opinion, if the petitioner's
appointment as a President of the Consumer Forum was, to be treated as a case of reappointment so
as to apply Rules 337 of RSR, 1951, the same ought to have been disclosed to the petitioner at the
time of offer of his appointment as a full time President of the District Consumer Forum while he
was working as District Judge so that the petitioner could make a choice as to whether he was
interested in joining as President of the Consumer Forum or was interested in continuing as a
full-fledged District Judge. The petitioner having already served as a President of the Forum with
full salary of a District Judge as per Rule 3 of the Consumer Protection (Rajasthan) Rules, 1987, the
same could not have been deducted by applying a fresh service condition in the midst of his tenure
by applying Rule 337 of RSR, 1951. It is quite clear that the Rajasthan Service Rules, 1951 is a
general rule governing all types of services in all types of services in Rajasthan, whereas the
Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is a special Act governing the terms and conditions of their tenure
specifying their emoluments and other benefits. It is an established principles that a general Act of
Rule cannot be allowed to prevail over a special Act or Rule, which in this case is Consumer
Protection Act, 1986."
20. In case of State of Rajasthan v. Amarnath Purohit (5), the Division Bench of this Court has taken
the view that if any RHJS Officer, who has been appointed as president, District Consumer Forum
for 5 years and before completion of 5 years if he is superannuated from Rajasthan Higher Judicial
Service, he no more remains an officer of the Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service through Rule 337 of
RSR, 1951 is strictly not applicable but the pension on his superannuation should be deducted from
his salary when the salary is paid to such officer during his rest of his tenure as President, District
Consumer Forum. In para 11 the Division Bench of this Court observed as under:-
"Salary of the Judge of a District Court is a vague term. The Senior Most Judge in RHJS is also a
Judge so a District Court and an officer who is at the bottom of the seniority list of the RHJS is also
a Judge of the District Court. All of them are technically eligible for appointment as District Judge
which is one of the qualification for being appointed as President, District Forum. There are
different scales in which the Judges of the District Court are fixed. Which of these scales will be
applicable to a person appointed as President of the District Form is not specified."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784286/ 5State Of Rajasthan And Ors. vs Shyam Sunder Gupta And Ors. on 7 April, 2003
21. In para 13, this Court also referred Rule 151 of the Rajasthan Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1996
which provides that in case of re-employment the pay should be fixed at the minimum of the pay
scale in that service. It has further been a held that by deducting pension from the salary on the
superannuation from RHJS, the salary of the officer has not been reduced at all then what he was
getting before superannuation in the RHJS.
22. The Kerala High Court has taken the contrary view taken by the Division Bench of this Court. In
case of State of Kerala v. Govindankutty (6), the Kerala High Court has referred the decision of their
Lordships in case of Nakara v. Union of India (7), and held that while the employee has right to gel
his pension and allowances due thereunder, therefore, he has a statutory right and the remuneration
for his post-retirement work in the Consumer Redressal Forum has to be separated and
independent of what is due to him by way of pension, therefore, pension should not be deducted
from his salary after retirement from Judicial Service of the State.
23. In case of V.S. Mallimath v. Union of India and Anr. (8), the issue before their Lordships
whether pension should be deducted from the salary of Chairman or Member of the National
Human Rights Commission. Their Lordships held that as per Rule 3(b), the pension should be
deducted from the salary and observed at page 9 as under:-
"We have, therefore, no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the proviso to Rule 3(b) would
apply to the retired Chief Justice of India or the retired Chief Justice of a High Court and the
pension which they are in receipt of, apart from the disability or would pension, has to be deducted
from their salary, which they are entitled to under the Rules."
24. In case of M.S. Chawla and Ors. v. State of Punjab and Anr. (9), their Lordships have considered
that the pension which appellants have received of their previous service as District Judge can be
deducted from the salary of the President of the District Consumer Form fixed under the provisions
of the Consumer protection Act and the Rules framed thereunder. The Lordships held that pension
should be deducted from the salary which a retired District Judge gets as President of the District
Consumer Forum and in the end, their Lordships observed at Page 396 as under:-
"We see no infirmity with the Government order dated 25th of January, 1996 and under the said
notification the salary of re-employed District Judges as President of the District Consumer Forum,
have rightly been fixed, taking into account the pension, which they are in receipt of, as retired
District Judges. The contention of Mr. Rao that the Salary fixed under the Act and the Rules framed
thereunder is being altered by an administrative order is of no force, in view of the legal provisions
enumerated above and in fact, it is the provision of the Punjab Civil Services Rules, dealing with the
salary of re-employed pensioners, which governs the field."
25. Mr. Jagdeep Dhankar, learned Senior Advocate for the RHJS officers has submitted that when a
judicial officer in service appointed as President, District Consumer Form, his salary cannot be fixed
less than what he was getting at the time of appointment, on his superannuation from Rajasthan
Higher Judicial Service, his salary should also not be reduced and he should get pension in addition
to the salary what he is getting on the date of his superannuation in RHJS. If pension is deducted,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784286/ 6State Of Rajasthan And Ors. vs Shyam Sunder Gupta And Ors. on 7 April, 2003
that would amount to put him in disadvantageous position than what he was getting on the date of
superannuation from the Rajasthan Higher Judicial Services.
26. Mr. Dhankar, learned Senior Advocate has further submitted that not only the pension but he is
also entitled for other allowances which the officer was getting while he was appointed as President,
District Consumer Forum, even after superannuation from the Rajasthan Higher Judicial Services
till he complete his tenure as President, District Consumer Forum.
27. The other learned counsel for the parties have adopted the arguments of Mr. Dhankar, learned
Senior Advocate.
28. Mr. R.N. Mathur, learned Additional Advocate General has submitted that in Rajasthan Higher
Judicial Services, there are three classes who can be appointed as President of the District Consumer
Form i.e. (a) an officer of Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service, after his retirement from the Rajasthan
Higher Judicial Services; (b) RHJS officer in service; he may have more than 5 years service in
Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service, he can come back to his cadre after completion of 5 years tenure
as President of District Consumer Form; (c) other class of officers of RHJS is an officer who has
been appointed for 5 years as President of District Consumer Forum while in service, but before
completion of 5 years as President of District Consumer Forum, he retires from RHJS.
29. What he will get as President of Consumer Forum from the date of his superannuation from
RHJS. Mr. Mathur submits that an officer who joins Consumer Forum while he was in service and
he came back to his cadre of RHJS after completion of 5 years and the officer who has been
appointed as President in the Consumer Forum after retirement from RHJS, he will not get any
amount in the name of pension. The officer who joins as President in the Consumer Forum and
retired during tenure of 5 years in Consumer Forum from RHJS, there is no jurisdiction to give him
the benefit of salary as President of Consumer Forum in addition to pension as pension has not been
earning in a day or two, it is earning of the whole tenure of his service period. Therefore, there is no
jurisdiction to extend the benefit of pension in addition to salary what he was getting on the date of
the retirement from RHJS.
30. We are concerned with the last class of RHJS Officers, what he will get after superannuation
from RHJS. As we have said earlier in the aforesaid paras that there is no specific rule which
governs this type of cases i.e. if a judicial officer appointed while in service of RHJS for five years but
before his completion of five years' tenure in the District Consumer Forum he retires from RHJS,
what will be his salary and perks after retirement from RHJS. Thus, rule is defective to this extent as
there is no such provision in the Rules to govern this type of situation. Therefore, we have to see the
harmonious construction of rules after going through these Rules and relevant provisions of the
Consumer Protection Act.
31. Sub-section (3) of Section 10 of the Act, 1986 provides for the salary or honorarium and other
allowances payable to the members of the District Forum. The relevant provision of Sub-section (3)
of Section 10 reads as under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784286/ 7State Of Rajasthan And Ors. vs Shyam Sunder Gupta And Ors. on 7 April, 2003
"The salary or honorarium and other allowances payable to conditions of service of the members of
the District Form shall be such as may be prescribed by the State Government."
32. Sub-section (2) of Section 30 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 empowers the State
Government to make rules. The relevant provision of Sub-section (2) of Section 30 reads as under:-
"Every member of the District Forum shall hold office for a term of five years or up to the age of 65
years, whichever is earlier, and shall not be eligible for re-appointment:
Provided that a member may resign his office in writing under his hand addressed to the State
Government and on such resignation being accepted, his office shall become vacant and may be
filled by the appointment of a person possessing any of the qualifications mentioned in Sub-section
(1) in relation to the category of the member who has resigned."
33. Rule 3 of the Rajasthan Consumer Protection Rules, 1987 provides for salaries and other
allowances and terms and conditions of the President and Members of the District Forum which
reads as under:-
"3. Salaries and other allowances and terms and conditions of the President and Members of the
District Forum (Section 19(3):
(1) The President of the District Forum shall receive the salary of the Judge of a District Court
appointed on part-time basis or an honorarium of Rs. 150/- per day if appointed on whole-time
basis. Other members if sitting on whole-time basis shall receive a consolidated honorarium of Rs.
2,000/- per months and if sitting on part-time basis, a consolidated honorarium of Rs. 1000/- per
day for the sitting.
(2) The President and the members of the District Forum shall be entitled for such travelling
allowance and daily allowance on official tour as are admissible to Grade-I Officer of the State
Government.
(3) The salary, honorarium and other allowanced shall be defrayed out of the Consolidated Fund of
the State Government.
(4) Before appointment, the President and the members of the District Forum shall have to take an
undertaking that he and his relatives as defined in the Companies Act, 1956 (Central Act I of 1956)
does not and will not have any such financial or other interests as is likely to affect prejudicially his
functions as a member.
(5) In addition to the provisions of Section 10(2) of the Act the State Government may remove from
the office, the President and member of a District Forum who,
(a) has been adjudged an insolvent, or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784286/ 8State Of Rajasthan And Ors. vs Shyam Sunder Gupta And Ors. on 7 April, 2003
(b) has been convicted of an offence which, in the opinion of the State Government, involves moral
turpitude, or
(c) has become physically or mentally incapable of acting as such President or member, or
(d) has acquired such financial or other interest as is likely to affect prejudicially his functions as a
member, or
(e) has so abused his position as to render his continuance in office prejudicial to the public interest:
Provided that the President or member shall not be removed from his office on the ground specified
in Clauses (d) and (e) of the (Sub-rule (5) except on an inquiry held by the State Government in
accordance with with such procedure as it may specify in this behalf and finds the member to be
guilty on such ground.
(6) The terms and conditions of the service of the President and the members of the District Forum
shall not be varied to their disadvantage during their tenure of office.
(7) Where any vacancy occurs in the office of the President of the District forum, the senior-most (in
order of appointment) member of District Forum, holding office for the time being, shall discharge
the functions of the President until a person appointed to fill such vacancy assumes the office of the
President of the District Forum.
(8) When the President of the District Forum is unable to discharge the functions wing to absence,
illness or any other cause, the senior-most (in order of the appointment) member of the District
Forum shall discharge the functions of the President until the day on which the President resumes
charges of his functions.
(9) The President or any member ceasing to hold office as such shall not hold any appointment in or
be connected with the management or administration of an organisation which has been the subject
of any proceeding under the Act during his tenure for a period of 5 years from the date on which he
ceases to hold such office."
34. Rule 337 of the Rajasthan Service Rules, 1951 provides what pay and pension re-employed
person will get. The relevant provision of Rule 337 of the Rajasthan Service Rules, 1951 reads as
under:-
"337. Pay of re-employed pensioners. - No Government servant, Civil or Military may retire with the
view of being re- employed and drawing pension in addition to pay whether in the general service or
in the service of any Local Fund."
35. There is no doubt that if any RH.JS officer has been appointed as President of the District
Consumer Forum, he gets the same salary including perquisites, allowances and benefits as were
payable to him as a Judge of the District Court. This becomes terms and conditions of his service in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784286/ 9State Of Rajasthan And Ors. vs Shyam Sunder Gupta And Ors. on 7 April, 2003
the context of Rule 3 of Rules, 1987, about which there is no controversy between the parties.
36. But whether all District Judges are getting same salary. All are not getting the same salary, that
depends upon how senior he is in service. After earning increment the senior District Judge may get
higher pay than the District Judge who has recently been promoted or appointed. There is a
difference in the amount of salary of Judge in District Court; the Amount depend upon his seniority
in Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service, though both are called the Judges of District Court. In our
view, the amount of salary of President of District consumer Forum will he the amount he was
getting in Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service at the time of appointment in Consumer Forum as
President of District Consumer Form.
37. But, we have not much concerned with this issue.
38. The real issue before us is that a Rajasthan Higher Judicial Officer who retires as a member of
RHJS before completion of 5 years' tenure in the district Consumer Forum, what salary he will get
after his retirement from Rajasthan higher Judicial Service and whether he will get the pension in
addition to salary and other allowances after retirement from Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service?
39. Mr. Dhankar, Sr. Advocate has emphasised on the words mentioned in Sub-rule (6) of Rule 3 of
the Rules, 1987 "the term and conditions of service shall not be varied to their disadvantage during
their tenure of office". He has submitted that when the tenure of president will continue for 5 years
in his tenure period, he should not be put to disadvantageous position till his retirement from the
District Consumer Forum. If pension is deducted from his salary, that would amount to put him in
disadvantageous position. With respect, we are unable to accept the submission of Mr. Dhankar that
if pension is deducted from the salary after his retirement from the Rajasthan Higher Judicial
Service, he will be put in disadvantageous position to the position what he was before retirement
from Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service.
40. It is true that after deduction of the pension from the salary he will get less amount of salary as
President, Consumer forum but total amount i.e. salary plus pension will come to the same amount.
Therefore, it cannot be said that the gets less amount than what he was getting before retirement
from Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service.
41. The judicial officer of Rajasthan Higher judicial Service who are appointed after retirement from
judicial service, their pension is deducted from the salary and on his appointment as President he
will get salary at the minimum of the pay scale minus pension. But a judicial officer who has been
appointed as President, District Consumer Form while in service, just before 15 days from the date
of his retirement from Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service, he will get the last drawn salary from the
date of his retirement in RHJS and not the minimum of pay scale, even though he retires from
RHJS, just after 15 days from the date of his appointment in Consumer Forum. Thus, he will get the
higher pay from the Judicial Officer who has been appointed after retirement.
42. There is no jurisdiction to allow the pension in addition to pay to judicial officer who has been
appointed while in judicial service, that would amount to give him double benefit over the officer

who has been appointed after their retirement from RHJS. We do not think that this is the intention
of the Legislature. Pension has not been earned only in 15 days but it is an earning of total period of
Service. Therefore, 15 days difference in retirement in Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service is not
justified to discriminate between the officer who retires before 15 days or after 15 days from the date
of appointment in District Consumer Form.
43. We agree that Rule 337 of Rajasthan Service Rules, 1951 has no application as no formal
re-employment is there on the post of President, District Consumer Forum on the date of his
retirement from RHJS, after his superannuation in the Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service, he cannot
be said to be in Rajasthan Higher. Judicial Service. His position cannot be better on his retirement
from an officer of Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service who has retired and thereafter appointed as
President, District Consumer Forum, at least for the purpose of deduction of pension from salary.
But his salary can not be fixed at the minimum of the pay scale after superannuation from the RHJS,
as per rules he shall not get less amount than what he was getting on the date of superannuation
from Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service till he complete his tenure in consumer Forum.
44. Mr. Dhankar, learned Senior Advocate has relied on the decision of Kerala High Court in case of
Govindankutty (supra) wherein the view has been taken that the pension is statutory right. Kerala
High Court has also referred the case of their Lordships in case of Nakara. The Kerala High Court
has taken the view that pension should not be deducted from the salary of the President of the
District Consumer Forum. With respect, we do not agree with the learned Judges of the Kerala High
Court. In case of D.S. Nakara (supra), the issue before their Lordships was that whether
discrimination can be made between he retired employees from a particular date and the employees
who retired thereafter, whether the benefit of revised pension scheme can be denied to the retired
employees who retired before that particular appointed date. Their Lordships have struck down that
rule which discriminate between the employees retired from a particular date and who retired after
that particular date. The cut off date was treated as arbitrary.
45. The RHJS officer who retired from RHJS during the period of tenure of President and who has
been appointed after retirement from RHJS in Consumer Forum, both stand on the same footing, so
far deduction of pension from salary is concerned. But at the same time if a judicial officer in
Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service is appointed as President of the district Consumer Forum,
Sub-rule (6) of Rule 3 of Rules, 1987 protect his last drawn salary as he cannot be put to
disadvantageous position that what he was getting at the time of appointment. Therefore, in case of
appointment of RHJS as President, District Consumer Forum while in Rajasthan Higher Judicial
Service whatever he was getting his pay/salary on the date of his retirement from RHJS, his pay is
protected and the total amount payable on the date of retirement, that cannot be reduced.
46. In case the president retires from Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service and get all benefit of
retirement on his superannuation from RHJS, his pension should be deducted as pension plus what
he is getting the salary after deduction of the pension, the amount is same what he was getting on
the date of his superannuation in RHJS. By deduction of pension it cannot be said that he has been
put to disadvantageous position.

47. Sub-rule (6) of Rule 3 of Rules, 1987 provides that the terms and conditions of service should not
be varied to disadvantage of the judicial officer during his tenure. As has been stated hereinaboye
deduction of pension from salary cannot be said to put him in disadvantageous position as he will
get the same total amount. But the other benefits and allowances which he was getting as Rajasthan
Higher Judicial Service will continue till he completes his tenure. If these allowances are denied on
his superannuation from RHJS that will tantamount to vary terms and conditions of his service as
President of Consumer Forum to his disadvantage while the continues as such notwithstanding his
retirement from RHJS and that will be in violation of Sub-rule (6) of Rule 3 of the Rajasthan
Consumer Protection Rules, 1987.
48. Some doubts are raised that if an officer in Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service has been
appointed as President of the District Consumer Forum and if the retires from RHJS before
completion of 5 years tenure period, will he continue as President in the District Consumer Form or
his appointment in District Consumer Forum will come to an end with the superannuation of the
officer in Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service and whether he should be re-appointed after his
superannuation in RHJS for rest of the period in Consumer Forum?
49. Clause (a) of Sub-section (1) of Section 10 is very clear on the issue. The qualification of a
President is that a person who is, or who has been, or is qualified to be a District Judge, who shall be
the President of District Consumer Forum. The officer who has been appointed as President of
District Consumer Forum while he was in service at the time of appointment, he was qualified for
the appointment as President in District Consumer Forum and Sub-section (2) of Section 10 further
provides that the term of office of the President shall be five years or up to the age of 65 years,
whichever is earlier and shall not be eligible for re-appointment. When statute prohibits the
re-appointment, there is no question of re-appointing him on superannuation from Rajasthan
Higher Judicial Service and once he was appointed as a President of District consumer Forum for 5
years or till he attain the age of 65 years, whichever is earlier, he will continue to hold the post of
President in District Consumer Forum till he completes his tenure period i.e. 5 years.
Superannuation in Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service during tenure does not affect the appointment
of the officer for a period of 5 years.
50. Therefore, no fresh appointment order need be passed to continue him for completion of the
period of 5 years. Statute itself provides the tenure of 5 years and when he was eligible at the time of
appointment, there is no question to cut short his tenure period. He will continue for 5 years tenure
period and superannuation from Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service will not come in his way for
completion of 5 years tenure period, thus, in our view, wen an officer of judicial service is appointed
as president of District Consumer Forum for 5 years and he retires from Rajasthan Higher Judicial
Service before completion of 5 years in Consumer Forum, he will not be re-appointed as President of
District Consumer Form for the rest of the period, specially there is no provision of re-appointment
in the Act, 1986. Rule 337 of the Rajasthan Service Rules, 1951 strictly has no application.
51. In the light of above discussions, we answer the questions referred to this Bench as Under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/784286/ 12State Of Rajasthan And Ors. vs Shyam Sunder Gupta And Ors. on 7 April, 2003
(1) The President, District Consumer forum gets the salary of a District Judge on his appointment
i.e. he will get salary what he was getting in Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service on the date of his
appointment.
(2) The person who is a member of Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service and appointed as a President,
District Consumer Forum, he will continue to get the same salary in pay scale of RHJS till he
reaches to the age of superannuation in Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service.
(3) A person who has been appointed as President of the District Consumer Form while in
Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service on his retirement from the Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service, he
will get the last drawn salary which he was getting on the date of his superannuation from Rajasthan
Higher Judicial Service minus pension which he gets on retirement from Rajasthan Higher Judicial
Service.
(4) A person who has been appointed as President of the District Consumer Forum while in
Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service, on his superannuation from Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service,
he cannot be treated as member of the Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service after his superannuation
from Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service though he will get all the benefits and allowances which
RHJS officers gets till his completion of the tenure in District Consumer Forum, but pension has to
be deducted from his salary.
(5) The person who has been appointed as President of the District Consumer Forum while in
Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service retires from Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service before completion
of 5 years, there is no question of his re-employment in Consumer Forum for rest of the tenure
Period. He will continue for 5 years in Consumer Form on the basis of his statutory appointment in
Consumer Forum.
(6) A person who has been appointed as President of the District Consumer Forum while he was in
Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service, after his retirement he will have the status as that of the
President of District Consumer Forum.
(7) The person who has been appointed as President of the District Consumer Forum while he was
in Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service, one he was given the appointment as President of the District
Consumer Forum for 5 years, he will hold that post for 5 years irrespective of his superannuation in
the Rajasthan Higher Judicial Service. Therefore, the superannuation in the Rajasthan Higher
Judicial Officer will not affect his tenure of 5 years in District Consumer Forum.
