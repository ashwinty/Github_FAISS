Economic Transport Organisation ... vs Dharwad Distt. Khadi Gramudyog ... on 31 March, 2000
Bench: M. Jagannadha Rao, M.B. Shah
CASE NO.:
Special Leave Petition (civil) 1318 of 1999
PETITIONER:
ECONOMIC TRANSPORT ORGANISATION ETC.
RESPONDENT:
DHARWAD DISTT. KHADI GRAMUDYOG SANGH ETC.
DATE OF JUDGMENT: 31/03/2000
BENCH:
M. JAGANNADHA RAO & M.B. SHAH
JUDGMENT:
JUDGMENT 2000 (2) SCR 888 The following Order of the Court was delivered :
The petitioner is a common carrier govered by the Carriers Act, 1865. It contends that under Section
14(l)(d) of the Consumers Protection Act, 1986 the Consumer Fora can direct payment of
compensation to the consumer for loss or injury suffered by the consumer due to the 'negligence' of
the opposite party and hence the burden of proof is on the complainant. It is contended that Section
9 of the Carriers Act which 'imposes burden on the defendant or the common carrier to prove
absence of negligence cannot therefore be applied so as to shift the onus to the carrier to prove
absence of negligence.
In view of the recent Judgment of this Court dated 28th March, 2000 in Patel Roadways Limited v.
Birla Yamaha Limited, in C.A. No. 9071 of 1996, we are of the view that the liability of the common
carriers is that of the insurer. It was held mere that Section 9 of the Carriers Act, 1865 applies to
matters before the Consumer Fora under the Consumers Protection Act. It was also held that the
principle underlying Section 9 of the said Act relating to burden of proof is a principle of common
law and has been incorporated in Section 9 of the Carriers Act. Even assuming that Section 9 of the
Carriers Act, 1865 does not apply to the cases before the Consumer fora under Consumers
Protection Act, the principle of common law above mentioned gets attracted to all these cases
coming up before the Consumer fora. Section 14(l)(d) of the Consumers Protection Act had to be
understood in that light and the burden of proof gets shifted to the carriers by the application of the
legal presumption under the common law. Section 14(l)(d) has to be under-stood in that manner.
The complainant can discharge the initial onus, even if it is laid on him under Section 14(l)(d) of the
Consumers Protection Act, by relying on Section 9 of the Carriers Act. It will therefore be for the
carrier to prove absence of negligence. It has been held La like circumstances that a defendant in a
suit on the basis of a negotiable instrument can discharge the onus lying on him under Section 118 of
the Negotiable Instruments Act by relying on another presumption under Section 114 of the
Evidence Act under which if a plaintiff does not produce the accounts in his personal custody an
adverse inference can be drawn against the plaintiff. Kundanlal v. Custodian, Evacuee Property, AIR

we dismiss the special leave petitions accord- ingly.
