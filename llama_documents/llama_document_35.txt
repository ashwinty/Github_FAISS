rs.
T.R. RAMACHANDRAN NAIR & B.KEMAL PASHA, JJ.

R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dated this the 16th day of January, 2014
O R D E R
Ramachandran Nair, J.
1) The important question that is raised in these revision petitions is, whether in the absence of
production of the alleged lease deed executed between the parties, which is an unregistered one, in
evidence, the reliance placed on certain alleged admissions made by the respondent-landlady, is
sufficient to presume a transaction of valid lease for a term exceeding one year so as to attract
Section 11(9) of the Kerala Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act (for short, the 'Act').
2) The respective petitioners are partners, doing business in the name and style of 'Hotel Paragon' in
a building of which the respondent is the landlady. Eviction is sought under Section 11(3) of the Act,
namely, for the bona fide need of the landlady for residential purposes as well as to start a garment
making unit in the petition schedule building. The Rent Control Court as well as the Appellate
Authority ordered eviction in favour of the landlady and hence the R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 revision
petitions have been filed by the petitioners-tenants, assailing the orders passed by the authorities
below.
3) We heard the learned Senior Counsel Shri R.D.Shenoi, learned counsel Shri Vinod Bhat, Shri
Basil Mathew, Shri N.M.Mohamed Ayub for the petitioners-tenants and learned counsel Shri
C.Varghese Kuriakose appearing for the first respondent-landlady. The parties are referred to as
arrayed in these revision petitions.
4) The learned Senior Counsel Shri R.D.Shenoi raised the following contentions:- The Act, is a
complete code in itself. It is submitted that the definitions of "building", "landlord" and "tenant" in
the Act are important and the learned Senior Counsel specifically referred to the word "let" provided
in the definition under Section 2 (1) of the Act, concerning "building". It is submitted that there can
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185245349/ 2M. Basheer vs Remani Gopalan on 16 January, 2014
be a transaction for the purpose of the Act to bring out a relationship between the landlord and
tenant and therefore, the admissions made by the landlady in the evidence of the terms of the lease
can be relied upon by the court to examine and find in favour of the tenants on the plea under
Section 11(9) of the Act. This is so, particularly, in the light of the provision under Section 11(9) of
the Act which only R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 indicates that the tenant will be entitled for the benefit
of the provision where "the tenancy is for a specified period agreed upon between the landlord and
the tenant". The learned Senior Counsel further elaborated the argument by submitting that an
unregistered lease deed cannot be received as evidence of any transaction affecting the property
going by the decisions of the Apex Court and this Court. In the case in hand, the document is not
relied upon by the landlady and the same has not been produced. In such a case, the true nature of
the transaction can be found by examining the other evidence in detail. It is submitted that the non
registration of the document will not affect the transaction and, therefore, in a case like this,
provisions of Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and Section 17 and 49 of the
Registration Act, 1908 need not be gone into. The principle of estoppel by conduct is attracted as the
transaction has been proved independent of the lease deed. It is submitted that in the decisions
relied upon by the Rent Control court, namely, Anthony vs. K.C.Ittoop and sons and others [(2000)
6 SCC 394], Samir Mukherjee vs. Davinder K.Bajaj and others [(2001) 5 SCC 259] and Paul vs.
Saleena [2004 (1) KLT 924], the narration of the facts will R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 show that in all
those cases, the unregistered lease deeds were produced in evidence and, therefore, the conclusions
and findings on the legal and factual aspects in those cases cannot have any application in these
cases. It is submitted that admission by the party is substantive evidence and, in these cases, the
admission by PW1 about the transaction is there. As far as those aspects are concerned, it cannot be
said that the principles under the Registration Act which refer to invalidity of the unregistered
document will apply here. It is therefore submitted that Section 11(9) of the Act is squarely attracted
to the facts of these cases.
5) On the merits of the findings regarding bona fide need also, the learned Senior Counsel raised
various arguments. It is submitted by referring to the pleadings in the eviction petition that the
landlady is having own building in Kalathilparambil Road and even though one floor of the building
is in the name of the husband against which certain proceedings for recovery of loans are there, as
far as the portion owned by the landlady is concerned, it is free from any such recovery steps and,
therefore, the first proviso to Section 11(3) of the Act is attracted and in the absence of cogent special
reasons, eviction R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 should not have been allowed. With regard to these
aspects learned Senior Counsel referred to the alleged inherent contradictions in the pleadings and
evidence adduced by the landlady. In this context, learned Senior Counsel referred to the evidence of
PWs.2 to 4 also. It is submitted that as far as the property owned by her is concerned the loan
transaction has also been cleared. It is submitted that the bona fide need pleaded is clearly a ruse to
evict the tenants.
6) In support of his arguments that the Act is a complete code by itself, the learned Senior Counsel
relied upon the following decisions:-
Sivarama Menon vs. Raghavan and others [1972 KLT 188], Joy vs. Stephen Jacob
[1984 KLT 72], Tresa vs. Joseph [2005 (4) KLT 435], V.Dhanapal Chettiar vs.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185245349/ 3M. Basheer vs Remani Gopalan on 16 January, 2014
Yesodai Ammal [AIR 1979 SC 1745] and Paul's case [2004 (1) KLT 924]. With regard
to the scope of the first proviso to Section 11(3) of the Act, learned Senior Counsel
relied upon the decisions in New Woodlands Hotel vs. Varkey [1974 KLT 867],
Chacko P.Mathew vs. Kuttappan [2002 (1) KLJ 868] and Janatha Drugs vs. Maithri
Construction [2007 (4) R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 KLT 625]; and with regard to the
scope of revisional jurisdiction under Section 20 of the Act, learned Senior Counsel
relied upon Abdul Salam vs. Sebastian [2013 (4) KLT592].
7) Learned counsel Shri N.M.Mohamed Ayub appearing for the petitioner in
R.C.R.No.66/2013 supported all the arguments of the learned Senior Counsel Shri
R.D.Shenoi and further submitted that it is for the second time that the landlady has
moved against the tenants of the petition schedule building under Section 11(3) of the
Act and on the previous occasion after the eviction was ordered, the building was
rented out to the present tenants without occupying it. According to the learned
counsel, it is a factor which should have been considered by the authorities below.
8) Learned counsel Shri C.Varghese Kuriakose appearing for the landlady submitted
that this is not a case where Section 11(9) could be applied. It is clearly pleaded by the
landlady that the tenancy is a month-to-month one. The learned counsel, after
referring to the pleadings of the petitioners-tenants, submitted that their counter
statement will show that they have admitted the existence of the lease deed and have
relied upon the terms of the said lease deed in support R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 of
their contentions. It is not a case where there is a transaction independent of the
lease deed. The lease deed is an unregistered one.
It is therefore, submitted that in such cases, going by the provisions under the Transfer of Property
Act, it can only be a month to month tenancy. The learned counsel therefore submitted that the
authorities below have rightly relied upon the principles of the Apex Court in Anthony's case
[(2000) 6 SCC 394], Samir Mukherjee's case [(2001) 5 SCC 259] and the decision of this Court in
Paul's case [2004 (1) KLT924].
9) With regard to the first proviso to Section 11(3) of the Act, the learned counsel for the landlady
submitted that it has been explained by the landlady in the eviction petition itself that, against the
property and the building in Kalathilparambil Road proceedings for recovery are pending at the
instance of the Financing Bank and the Sales Tax Department, for recovery of loan arrears from the
husband of the landlady, whose whereabouts are unknown. It is a case where the landlady is
conducting a Press in her building in Swamy Chinmayananda Road against which also recovery
proceedings are R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 pending. All these facts have been proved in evidence by
examining PWs.2 to 4.
10) Therefore, the learned counsel Shri C.Varghese Kuriakose submitted that special reasons have
been attributed by the landlady in the pleadings which have been further proved in the evidence
also. The evidence adduced with regard to the recovery proceedings in addition to what has been
stated in the rent control petition will explain the predicament of the landlady and therefore as she
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185245349/ 4M. Basheer vs Remani Gopalan on 16 January, 2014
wants a proper place to reside - since she is now residing in a rented building
- and also wants to start a garment making unit on a moderate basis, the plea under Section 11(3) of
the Act has been fully established. She has explained that the printing press cannot be run profitably
and therefore she wants to switch over to the garment making unit. Learned counsel also elaborately
referred to the pleadings and evidence in the case in support of his arguments.
11) Shri C. Varghese Kuriakose relied upon several decisions of the Apex Court and this Court. The
important ones are Anthony's case [(2000) 6 SCC 394], Samir Mukherjee's case [(2001) 5 SCC 259],
K.B.Saha and Sons Private Limited vs. Development Consultant R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 Limited
[(2008) 8 SCC 564], Paul's case[2004 (1) KLT 924], Dasan vs. Janardhanan [2009 (2) KLT 726=
2009 (2) KHC 613], Aniyan T.V. and another vs. T.K.Raveendran [2012 (4) KHC 811 (DB)], M/s.
Cannanore Drug House, Kannur vs. Cheriya Melat Abdul Azeez [2013 KHC 2518], San Varghese and
another vs. Avira Pappu and others [2013 (2) KHC 48], Vayalilakath Abdul Nazar vs. Paruthithodi
Mammad Koya [2011 (2) KHC 677=2011 (2) KLT 914], Jerry Joseph vs. Selvaraj [2002 (2) KLT 129
= 2002 KHC 398] and M.Padmanabha Setty vs. K.P.Papiah Setty [1966 KHC 711 = AIR 1966 SC
1824].
12) He also relied upon the Black Law Dictionary 7th Edition to advert to the meaning of the words
"let", lease etc.. The meaning of the words "let" is the following: "to offer (property) for lease".
Meaning of "lease" is given as "a contract by which a rightful possessor of real property conveys the
right to use and occupy the property in exchange for consideration, usually, rent". The learned
counsel also referred to the meaning "month-to-month lease" which is the following: "A tenancy
with no written contract". R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013
13) We will refer to the necessary pleadings of the parties in the context of the arguments on both
sides. In the eviction petition in paragraph (1) the landlady has averred that the petition schedule
building is under the possession of the respondents in the rent control petition as tenants and the
building was let out on 22/03/2004. It is a tenancy from month-to-month. To begin with the rent
was `25,000/- and the present rent is `27,500/-. She has further averred as follows:
"In fact, there is a lease deed dated 22/03/2004 which contains the original date of
letting and the rent amounts." It is further averred in paragraph (2) that the landlady
is running a printing press in her building at Swami Chinmayananda Road,
Ernakulam and the building wherein the press is located and the land upon which the
building is situated has been mortgaged with M/s.Kerala Financial Corporation in
connection with another industry by name "Siva Krishna Minerals". The transaction
became a defaulting one and the Kerala Financial Corporation has started revenue
recovery proceedings against the said security property and, therefore, she is
constrained to shift her press to another place. It is also averred that she has been
residing in the house owned by her husband and the house and the R.C.R.Nos.66 &
69/2013 property situated therein have been taken possession of by the Sales Tax
Department for the sales tax dues under Kerala General Sales Tax Act of her
husband. As the building has been taken over, she is residing in a rented flat, in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185245349/ 5M. Basheer vs Remani Gopalan on 16 January, 2014
present address shown in the eviction petition itself. On account of the above two
circumstances, she bona fide needs the petition schedule building to start her own
business and to accommodate her dwelling needs. It is averred further that the
printing industry run by her is under threat of stoppage at any moment and she
wants to start a garment making unit of her own in which she is experienced. Apart
from starting the said unit, she wants to accommodate her residence in the petition
schedule building. In paragraph (5) it is averred that she is a co-owner of the building
located at Kalathilparambil Road. The said building is jointly owned by her and her
husband and for the dues of her husband, the said building and property have been
attached by the Sales Tax Department. Apart from that the State Bank of Travancore
from whom loan is contracted by the husband of the petitioner is also proceeding on
the said property. Therefore, the said building cannot be put to the bona fide need of
the landlady. She has no other R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 building having full right or
half right in Ernakulam City. Therefore, it is contended that the first proviso to
Section 11(3) of the Act is not applicable.
14) We will now refer to the objections separately filed by the petitioners herein. In
the objection filed by the first respondent in the rent control petition, namely, the
petitioner in R.C.R.No.66/2013, in paragraph (3), he has denied the averment of the
landlady that the lease arrangement is on a month-to-month basis. It is stated that
the tenants took the petition schedule building on rent on 22/03/2004, to conduct a
hotel. The initial period of lease agreed between the parties was two years from the
date of lease reserving the right of the tenants to get the lease period renewed for a
further period of two years. He has also stated that there is a condition for
enhancement of rent at the rate of 10% after every two years. The tenants are
conducting a hotel in the petition schedule building in the name and style of "Hotel
Paragon". In paragraphs (4) and (5) he has stated about the alleged expenditure
incurred to make the building suitable for conducting their hotel business. In
paragraph (6) it is averred further that the tenants are entitled to renew the lease
period for a further period of R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 two years as per clause 14 of
the lease deed on payment of rent at 10% above the existing rate. It has also been
averred that after the initial period of two years, such enhanced rent is being paid.
Various other allegations in the rent control petition have been denied. In the
additional objection filed by the petitioner in R.C.R.No.69/2013, in paragraph (3) it is
averred that the building was taken on rent for conducting a hotel from 22/03/2004
and the initial period of lease agreed between the parties was two years from the date
of lease.
There is a further agreement to renew the lease period for a further period of two years with an
enhancement by 10% after the initial period of two years. He has also denied the various other
statements made by the landlady in the eviction petition.
15) First we will come to the important question, namely, one concerning the benefit pleaded by the
tenants under Section 11(9) of the Act. We herein below extract Section 11(9) of the Act for easy
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185245349/ 6M. Basheer vs Remani Gopalan on 16 January, 2014
reference.
R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 "Where the tenancy is for a specified period agreed upon between the
landlord and the tenant, the landlord shall not be entitled to apply to the Rent Control Court before
the expiry of such period."
16) The admission made by PW1 in the cross-examination is heavily relied upon by the learned
Senior Counsel Shri R.D.Shenoi. In the cross-examination she has given an answer that the original
of the rent deed is in her possession and a specific question was put whether the same can be
produced, to which she answered that it can be produced. According to her an amount of `5 lakhs
was given as security and the period of agreement was two years. There is a clause that after the
period of two years if 10% enhancement of rent is given it will be extended for a further period of
two years. The rent initially fixed was `25,000/- and to a specific question whether 10%
enhancement has been given, she answered the negative. She maintained that the period of
agreement has not been extended further.
17) RW1 is the petitioner in R.C.R.No.69/2013. His evidence was also relied upon by the learned
Senior Counsel for the petitioners to R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 contend that documents have been
produced which will show that the enhancement of rent by 10% was given. Specific reference is
made to Ext.B13 which will show payment of rent by cheque for some months after April 2006. It is
explained that those payments are after deducting TDS. Thus it is contended that read along with
the evidence of landlady these documents will definitely show that the period of lease has been
extended by two more years, which will defeat the claim of the landlady.
18) The question raised is no longer res integra. The Act, namely, the Kerala Buildings (Lease and
Rent Control) Act is one to "regulate the leasing of buildings and to control the rent of such
buildings in the State of Kerala". The word "lease" is not there in the definition clause. Section 2(1)
of the Act contains the definition of "building", S.2(3) gives the definition of "landlord" and S.2(6)
defines the "tenant". Section 11 of the Act starts with a non obstante clause, that "notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in any other law or contract a tenant shall not be evicted,
whether in execution of a decree or otherwise, except in accordance with the provisions of this
R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 Act". The question is whether the provisions of the Transfer of Property
Act are excluded or not.
19) We will straight away come to the decisions relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel Shri
R.D.Shenoi. In Sivarama Menon's case [1972 KLT 188], the tenant claimed value of improvements.
While examining the question as to whether, it could be considered by the Rent Control Court, in
paragraph (1) it has been held as follows:
".........Decisions are uniform that the Rent Control Court is not expected to go into
the question of value of improvements. It is not a matter falling within the
jurisdiction of the Rent Control Court. The Act is a complete code on the rights and
liabilities of the landlord and tenant in respect of matters falling within the purview
of landlord and tenant in respect of the building and it is not permissible for a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185245349/ 7M. Basheer vs Remani Gopalan on 16 January, 2014
landlord or tenant in cases governed by the Act to fall upon the provisions of the
Transfer of Property Act or the contract of tenancy or other extraneous
circumstances."
Finally, it was held that "the tenant is not entitled to put forward the claim for value of
improvements in bar of eviction and the Rent Control Court is not empowered to adjudicate such a
matter, as it is R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 not within its jurisdiction". We notice that only in the
context of adjudication of a legality of the claim for value of improvements, the findings have been
rendered to the effect that the tenant cannot fall back upon the provisions of the Transfer of
Property Act or the contract of tenancy. Various decisions, viz., Gomathi Ammal vs. Chinakannu
Pillai [1954 KLT 278], A.Appukuttan Pillai vs. Thiruvadinatha Pillai [1958 KLT 440], M/s. Panchmal
Narayana Shenoy vs. Basti Venkatesha Shenoy [(1966) 2 MYS LJ 133] and M/s. Panchmal Narayana
Shenoy vs. Basti Venkatesha Shenoy [AIR 1971 SC 942] holding similar views have been relied upon.
20) The next decision is Joy's case [1984 KLT 72]. The facts of the case show that pending a suit for
declaration of the rights of the plaintiff, and recover the building of the landlord, a lease of the
building was given, and the question was whether the tenant could be evicted in execution of the
decree. In paragraph (5), the said question was gone into. In that context it has been held as follows:
"........The non obtante clause contained in S.11(1) has to be given its full effect. The
rent control legislation is a self-contained statute and the rights and liabilities of
R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 the landlord and tenant are to be governed by its provisions
and not by the provisions in the Transfer of Property Act or any other law. In other
words, the provisions of Act 2 of 1965 will override the provisions of the Transfer of
Property Act as far as landlords and tenants of buildings to which it applies. ........"
The argument raised herein is that the above dictum will show that the provisions of the Transfer of
Property Act will stand excluded. We are of the view that the context under which the said dictum
has been laid down will have to be considered to understand the true effect. It was mainly a case
where the question whether a tenant in respect of whom the Rent Control Act will apply, could be
evicted, without recourse to the provision of the Act arose for consideration. The suit for declaration
of rights and the suit for recovery of the building has already been decreed also. But this Court did
not agree that the tenant can be evicted without recourse to the provisions of the Rent Control Act.
The said decision cannot be taken as an authority for the proposition that none of the provisions of
the Transfer of Property Act will govern the transaction between the landlord and tenant coming
under the Rent Control Act.
R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013
21) The next decision is by a Division Bench of this Court in Tresa's case [2005 (4) KLT 435]
wherein in paragraph 10 while referring to the provisions of the Act it has been held that it is a
special statute. We extract the relevant dictum laid down therein:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185245349/ 8M. Basheer vs Remani Gopalan on 16 January, 2014
"The Kerala Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act is a special statute governing and
regulating tenancy and sub- tenancy. The provisions of the Act supersede the general
law of tenancy. Though Section 2(6)(ii) of the Act recognizes the principle of holding
over, by including in the definition of tenant "a person continuing in possession after
the termination of the tenancy in his favour", it excludes "a person placed in
occupation of a building, by its tenant". S.2(6)(ii) of the Act is incompatible with
S.116 of the Transfer of Property Act and therefore the Act supersedes the general law
of tenancy, in the matter of holding over."
The context under which the said dictum has been laid down shows that by Ext.B1 letter, the
landlord had agreed to sub-let the building for a period of one year to any person of the choice of the
tenant. The petition for eviction for subletting under Section 11(4)(i) of the Act was resisted in the
light of the said letter. This Court was of the view R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 that a person inducted as
per the permission granted under Ext.B1 cannot claim the right to hold over so as to bind the
landlord. It is in that context, the above dictum was laid down. Therefore, only to understand the
scope of Section 11(4)(i) of the Act, the legal position was explained. The same will not show that it
will apply on all fours to each one of the circumstances.
22) V.Dhanapal Chettiar's case [AIR 1979 SC 1745] is a decision of the Constitution Bench consisting
of seven Judges of the Apex Court. The important question, whether for evicting a tenant under the
Rent Control Acts of the respective States, notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act
is necessary or not, was answered therein and it was held that the same is not necessary. While
answering the said question, the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act and certain provisions of
the State Rent Control Acts have been examined. But, while referring to the scheme of the State Rent
Control Acts, the Apex Court has made the following conclusion in para (5):
"Under Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act a lease of immovable property
from year to year, or for any R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 term exceeding one year, or
reserving a yearly rent, can be made only by a registered instrument. None of the
State Rent Acts has abrogated or affected this provision."
The same is quite important in the context of the argument herein. In the Kerala Buildings (Lease
and Rent Control) Act also there is no provision abrogating or affecting Section 107 of the Transfer
of Property Act.
23) Now we will come to the important decision of the Apex Court, by a three Judges Bench in
Anthony's case [(2000) 6 SCC 394] with regard to interpretation of Sections 105 to 107 of the
Transfer of Property Act and with regard to the proof of landlord tenant relationship in the face of
an unregistered instrument. The question was considered under the Kerala Buildings (Lease and
Rent Control) Act itself. In the light of the arguments raised by both sides herein, we will refer
somewhat elaborately to the principles and the findings of the said Judgment.
24) Therein, the unregistered lease deed was meant for a period of five years. The trial court found
that the appellant is not a tenant as the lease was void on account of non-registration of the lease
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185245349/ 9M. Basheer vs Remani Gopalan on 16 January, 2014
deed. R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 In the first appeal, the District Judge found that the in spite of non-
registration of the instrument there was a valid tenancy of the building and hence the appellant
could not be evicted except in accordance with the provisions of the Rent Control Act. This was
reversed by this Court in the Second Appeal by holding the view that the first defendant has not
proved that independent of the void lease, a relationship of landlord and tenant has come into
existence between the parties and, accordingly, decreed the suit for recovery of possession of the
plaint schedule property.
25) While examining the related questions, the Apex Court in paragraph (6) referred to the
definition of the words "tenant" and "landlord" under Section 2 of the Rent Control Act apart from
the definition of "building" and held that the word "let" has only one meaning and that is to "demise
on lease". We extract paragraph (6) of the Judgment below:
"6. In spite of the chequered career of the litigation the only question which has now
bogged down to be decided is whether the suit building is held by the appellant under
a lease or not. The word "tenant" is defined in Section 2(6) of the Rent Act as "any
person by R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 whom or on whose account rent is payable for a
building ....". Landlord is defined as including "the person who is receiving or is
entitled to receive the rent of a building". Now the definition of "building" must be
looked into. In clause (1) of Section 2 it is defined as "any building or hut or part of a
building or hut, let or to be let separately for residential or non-residential purposes
..". In the above context the word "let" has only one meaning and that is to demise on
lease."
In paragraph (7) it was held further as follows:
"The above three definitions unmistakably point to the necessity for a building to be
covered by a lease under law in order to bring such building within the purview of the
Rent Act. If there is no lease of a building the Rent Act has no application. Thus what
is important now is to know whether there has been a lease of the building in
question. ....."
26) In paragraph (8) it was held that the unregistered instrument providing for a period of five years
for the period of lease "cannot create a lease on account of three-pronged statutory inhibitions".
Their Lordships considered the three inhibitions; namely (i) Section 107 of the Transfer of Property
Act, 1882 (ii) Section 17(1) of the R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 Registration Act, 1908 and, (iii) Section
49 of the Registration Act. It was held in paragraph 11 that in the light of the above, "the resultant
position is insurmountable that so far as the instrument of lease is concerned there is no scope for
holding that appellant is a lessee by virtue of the said instrument. The court is disabled from using
the instrument as evidence and hence it goes out of consideration in this case, hook, line and
sinker".
27) Thereafter, the true nature of the transaction in the case was examined and in paragraph 14 it
was found that the jural relationship is only that of a lessor and lessee falling within the purview of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185245349/ 10M. Basheer vs Remani Gopalan on 16 January, 2014
the second paragraph of Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act and in paragraph 16 it has been
declared as follows:
"....... Non-registration of the document had caused only two consequences. One is
that no lease exceeding one year was created. Second is that the instrument became
useless so far as creation of the lease is concerned. Nonetheless the presumption that
a lease not exceeding one year stood created by conduct of parties remains un-
rebutted."
R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 Finally, in paragraph 20 it was held that the provisions of the Rent Control
Act are applicable.
28) Of course, that is a case where the unregistered lease deed was relied upon by the tenant.
29) In the next case, namely, Samir Mukherjee's case [(2001) 5 SCC 259] the facts show that the suit
was one for eviction and also for recovery of arrears of rent and damages/mesne profits. It was
pleaded that the defendant was a monthly tenant and therefore, 15 days' notice terminating the
tenancy, under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act alone was required and the tenancy was
created by an oral agreement. It was contended before the Apex Court, by referring to the provisions
of the Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, that since the lease was for a manufacturing
purpose, six months notice is required. In that context, Their Lordships examined the relevant
provisions, namely, Sections 106 and 107 of the Transfer of Property Act. In paragraph (7) it was
declared as follows:
"....... In the absence of a registered instrument no valid lease from year to year or for
a term exceeding one year R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 or reserving a yearly rent can be
created. If the lease is not a valid lease within the meaning of the opening words of
Section 106 the rule of construction embodied therein would not be attracted....."
Even though the proceedings therein was a suit, the interpretation of Section 107 of the Transfer of
Property Act is quite apposite to the context herein as S.107 has not been abrogated by any State
Rent Control Acts as held by the Apex Court in V.Dhanapal Chettiar's case [AIR 1979 SC 1745].
30) These decisions have been examined by a Division Bench of this Court in Paul's case [2004 (1)
KLT 924]. There also a similar argument under Section 11(9) of the Act was raised. Of course the
document, namely, an unregistered lease deed was produced as Ext.A2 in that case. The question
whether such a document can be relied upon as a defence under Section 11(9) of the Act was
examined. Learned Senior Counsel Shri R.D.Shenoi tried to distinguish it by pointing out that in
that case the document was produced in evidence, which is different from the facts of this case.
Learned Senior Counsel also relied upon paragraph (7) of the R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 Judgment to
show that there is also a finding that the Rent Control Act is a complete code in itself which will
support the pleas of the petitioners herein. But, we notice that the Division Bench herein expressed
the view that the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act are not fully excluded and in paragraph
(7) it has been held as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185245349/ 11M. Basheer vs Remani Gopalan on 16 January, 2014
"...... The Act is a self contained statute and the rights and liabilities of the landlord
and tenant are to be governed by its provisions. Rights available to the tenant and
landlord under the general law and the Transfer of Property Act are substantially
curtailed by the provisions of the Rent Control Act. Though Rent Control Act is a
piece of social legislation mainly to protect tenants from frivolous eviction, certain
salutary provisions have also been made in the Act in order to do justice to the
landlord. The legislation is neither pro-tenant nor-pro- landlord. Rent Control Act
does not clearly disable the provisions contained in the Transfer of Property Act as
far as rights of parties are concerned. At the same time, it makes provision for
eviction on such specified grounds and it cannot be resisted on the basis of rights
conferred under the Transfer of Property Act. When eviction is sought by the
landlord under the provisions of R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 the Rent Control Act and
once the requirement contemplated under the Rent Control Act are satisfied, tenant
cannot claim total prohibition of eviction on the basis of the provisions contained in
the Transfer of Property Act or the provisions contained in the Contract Act."
(emphasis supplied by us)
31) Their Lordships examined the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, namely,
Sections 105 to 107 and the Sections 17 and 49 of the Registration Act in paragraphs
10 and 11. Thereafter Their Lordships considered the dictum laid down in Anthony's
case [(2000) 6 SCC 394] as well as Samir Mukherjee's case [(2001) 5 SCC 259] and
held as follows in paragraph 12:
".......... The above mentioned statutory provisions and the decisions would
conclusively show in the absence of a registered instrument no valid lease from year
to year or a term exceeding one year or reserving yearly rent can be created."
It has been further held in paragraph 13 that "in the instant case, admittedly lease deeds are
unregistered documents. Therefore, tenancy is to be treated as tenancy from month to month".
R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013
32) Thereafter, the further argument that even if the lease deed is an unregistered one, the period
mentioned in the same is binding on the parties and an eviction petition filed before the expiry of
the period is hit by Section 11(9) of the Act, was examined. The further question whether the same
could be used for a collateral purpose, namely, to prove the period of lease was also examined in the
light of various decisions of the Apex Court and other High Courts. It has been held in paragraphs 14
and 15 as follows:
"14. The various provisions contained in Ss.11(2) to 11(8) of the Rent Control Act are
substantial provisions. Compulsorily registerable document, though unregistered and
inadmissible as evidence of a transaction affecting immovable property, may be
admitted as evidence of collateral facts, or for any collateral purpose, that is for any
purpose other than that of creating, declaring, assigning, limiting or extinguishing a
right to immovable property.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185245349/ 12M. Basheer vs Remani Gopalan on 16 January, 2014
15. The above mentioned judicial pronouncements and the principles laid down
therein would clearly show that an unregistered document cannot be used for the
purpose of establishing that that document created or declared or assigned or limited
or extinguished a right to R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 immovable property. Period of
lease is integral part of the agreement and not a collateral one. Unregistered lease
deeds cannot be pressed into service to create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish any
right, title or interest in or to the property comprised in the document. They create
only month to month tenancy and only if the lease is registered under the
Registration Act, it would create transfer of right to enjoy the immovable property for
a specific term exceeding one year. We therefore hold that unregistered lease deeds
by which rights of parties in these cases are governed would not stand in the way of
the landlord from filing application under Ss.11 (2)(b), 11(4)(ii) or 11(4)(v) of Act 2 of
1965 and the application would not be hit by S.11(9) of the Act."
33) We may notice that the Division Bench has emphatically held that "period of lease is integral
part of the agreement and not a collateral one and unregistered lease deeds cannot be pressed into
service" in such circumstances and the tenancy created is only month- to-month and only if the
lease deed is registered under the Registration Act, it would create transfer of right to enjoy the
immovable property for a specific term exceeding one year. It was held therefore, that Section 11(9)
is not attracted. R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013
34) K.B.Saha's case [(2008) 8 SCC 564] is a Judgment of the Apex Court wherein the use of an
unregistered document for consideration as evidence for any collateral transaction was considered.
In paragraph 34, after referring to the various Judgments of the Apex Court, the legal position has
been explained thus:
"34.From the principles laid down in the various decisions of this Court and the High
Courts, as referred to hereinabove, it is evident that :-
1. A document required to be registered is not admissible into evidence under Section
49 of the Registration Act.
2. Such unregistered document can however be used as an evidence of collateral
purpose as provided in the Proviso to Section 49 of the Registration Act.
3.A collateral transaction must be independent of, or divisible from, the transaction
to effect which the law required registration.
4. A collateral transaction must be a transaction not itself required to be effected by a
registered document, that is, a transaction creating, etc. any right, title or interest in
immoveable R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 property of the value of one hundred rupees
and upwards.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185245349/ 13M. Basheer vs Remani Gopalan on 16 January, 2014
5. If a document is inadmissible in evidence for want of registration, none of its terms
can be admitted in evidence and that to use a document for the purpose of proving an
important clause would not be using it as a collateral purpose."
It was also held in paragraph 35 that the particular clause in the lease agreement relied on in that
case cannot be called a collateral purpose.
35) A Division Bench of this Court in Aniyan T.V. 's case [2012 (4) KHC 811 (DB)], in the context of a
similar argument under Section 11(9) of the Act, has examined the question as to whether any
unregistered documents can be looked into for collateral purposes. Therein also the argument was
by referring to the particular words in Section 11(9) of the Act, namely, "agreed upon between the
landlord and the tenant" to justify the plea that an unregistered lease deed can be looked into for
purpose of determining the terms of lease. The above argument was rejected in paragraph 16 as
follows:
"16. In this case, we are dealing with a question whether a particular clause contained
in an unregistered lease deed can be looked into for the purpose of R.C.R.Nos.66 &
69/2013 determining the terms of lease. Though the learned Senior Counsel for the
revision petitioners gave thrust to the words "agreed upon between the landlord and
the tenant" appearing in Section 11(9), the said agreement can only be a legal
agreement. An agreement is said to be legal only if it is enforceable by law. The
definite case of the revision petitioners is that the lease was for a for a period of 15
years. Being a lease of immovable property from year to year exceeding one year it is
compulsorily registrable under Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908."
It has been thus held that an agreement for the purpose of Section 11 (9) can only be a legal
agreement and an agreement is said to be legal only if it is enforceable by law. It was held in
paragraph 21 that "as the term of lease imposes a limit on the interest of the parties, an unregistered
document cannot be relied on for ascertaining the term of lease" and reliance was placed on
K.B.Saha's case [(2008) 8 SCC 564].
36) Another Division Bench in M/s. Cannanore Drug House case [2013 KHC 2518] has followed the
above dictum while considering the question whether an unregistered document (Ext.A1 produced
in R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 that case) could be relied upon by the tenant to contend that the eviction
petition filed is premature. The answer was in the negative.
37) The legal principles which we have examined above will therefore show that the applicability of
Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act is not abrogated by the provisions of the Rent Control
Act. If that be so, a lease exceeding for a period of one year can only be made by a registered
instrument. Sections 17 and 49 of the Registration Act also will therefore come into the way of the
tenant getting the benefit of an unregistered instrument. This in the nutshell is the dictum laid down
in the Judgments we have discussed above, especially, in the context of Section 11(9) of the Act by
the Division Bench in Paul's case [2004 (1) KLT924].
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185245349/ 14M. Basheer vs Remani Gopalan on 16 January, 2014
38) We will next examine whether the plea of the learned Senior Counsel Shri R.D.Shenoi that
herein the transaction has been proved independently in view of the admissions of the landlady,
could be accepted, even though the unregistered lease deed is not produced in evidence.
R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013
39) The learned Senior Counsel also invited our attention to page 1571 of commentary on the
Transfer of Property Act, 1882 by Shri Darashaw Jivaji Vakil containing the following commentary:
"S.17 of the Registration Act deals only with documents and not with the validity of
the transaction they embody. On the other hand, S.107 of T.P.Act strikes at the
validity of the transactions of leases."
We do not see anything in it contrary to the legal position already explained.
40) The fact that a lease deed is there, is evident from the pleadings in the rent control petition as
well as in the objections filed by the tenants. In paragraph (1) of the eviction petition, the date of
letting of the building to the tenants is given as 22/03/2004 and it is specifically stated that there is
lease deed dated 22/03/2004 which contains the original date of letting and the rent amounts. The
same is not denied in the objections filed by both the tenants. Going by the averments in the
objections filed by the tenants which we have adverted to, it is clear that with regard to the date of
letting there is no dispute and reference is made to the lease deed by the petitioner-tenant in
R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 R.C.R.No.66/2013 in his objections, when we read paragraphs 3 and 6 of
the objections together. The tenants' contention is also mainly that after the initial period of two
years, the lease period is renewed for a further period of two years, going by the reservation in the
lease deed under clause 14 by paying rent 10% above the existing rate. Clearly therefore, it is not a
case where the tenants have also a case that there is a transaction independent of a lease deed, to
create the relationship of landlord and tenant. In the chief affidavit, PW1 has stated about the lease
deed and in cross-examination she was specifically asked whether the lease deed has been produced.
The suggestions of the tenants while cross-examining the landlady have to be understood in the said
context. It is not a case where the tenants have disputed the lease deed and wanted to establish that
there is a landlord and tenant relationship which has come to stay independent of such a lease deed.
No such contention is there and no efforts have been made by them in their evidence also to
establish such a case.
41) Going by the proof affidavit filed by the second respondent in the rent control petition, namely,
the petitioner in R.C.R.No.69/2013, he has stated that there is no month-to-month tenancy and the
R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 building was taken on rent on 22/03/2004 for an initial period of two
years. There is a clause in the rent agreement executed that on payment of 10% by way of
enhancement of rent, the period will stand extended by two more years. In paragraph (8) it is stated
that the period of lease has thus been extended upto 22/03/2008 and eviction petition filed before
the said period is not maintainable. Further, while being examined as RW1 in the
cross-examination, the petitioner in R.C.R.No.69/2013 has clearly stated that the lease agreement
was executed in the joint names of both the tenants. To a specific question whether they are
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185245349/ 15M. Basheer vs Remani Gopalan on 16 January, 2014
continuing even now under the said lease agreement, it has been answered "yes" and it is further
stated that he does not remember whether the copy of the agreement is with him and the original
rent agreement is with the landlady. He also does not remember whether it has been registered.
42) If we examine the pleadings and evidence in this case, as rightly submitted by Shri C.Varghese
Kuriakose learned counsel for the respondent-landlady, there is no transaction independent of the
unregistered lease deed. Therefore, even if the document has not been produced by both sides, they
have mentioned about the R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 existence of the lease deed in the pleadings and
the tenants are fully relying upon the said lease deed to explain the terms of the lease like the initial
period of lease, its renewal and with regard to the payment of enhanced amount of rent by 10% , it
cannot be said that there is a transaction independent of the said unregistered lease deed. Therefore,
even though the same is not produced in evidence, it cannot help to advance the contentions of the
petitioners. Thus, in the light of the dictum laid down in Anthony's case [(2000) 6 SCC 394], Samir
Mukherjee's case [(2001) 5 SCC 259], K.B.Saha's case [(2008) 8 SCC 564] and M/s. Cannanore
Drug House case [2013 KHC 2518] the arguments of the learned Senior Counsel cannot be accepted.
Hence, we are of the view that the tenants are not entitled for the benefit of Section 11(9) of the Act.
The word "let" means "demise on lease" as held in Anthony's case (supra). In this case, the jural
relationship of parties as lessor and lessee has not been disputed. Such being the situation and as
the lease deed remained as an unregistered one and even though not produced in evidence, the
period of tenancy will be only month-to-month, in the light of the combined effect of Sections 106
and 107 of the Transfer of Property R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 Act. Section 107 of the Transfer of
Property Act being not abrogated by the Rent Control Court Act and as there is no provision
contrary to Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act, the same will be definitely attracted.
43) That brings us to the next issue, namely, regarding the finding under the first proviso to Section
11(3) of the Act. The first proviso to Section 11(3) of the Act reads as follows:
"Provided that the Rent Control Court shall not give any such direction if the landlord
has another building of his own in his possession in the same city, town or village
except where the Rent Control Court is satisfied that for special reasons in any
particular case it will be just and proper to do so".
44) The decisions relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel Shri R.D.Shenoi in this context are New
Woodlands Hotel's case [1974 KLT 867], Chacko P.Mathew's case [2002 (1) KLJ 868] and Janatha
Drugs' case [2007 (4) KLT 625]. In the first of the decisions it has been held that "Really the
existence of another building of his own in his possession in the City is a factor to be R.C.R.Nos.66 &
69/2013 taken into account in arriving at a decision whether the landlord bona fide needs the
building for his occupation. ........ The law requires that the Rent Control Court must be satisfied by
such special reasons that the building in his possession is not sufficient for his occupation before
ordering eviction of a tenant from the building in the latter's possession". The Division Bench in
Chacko P.Mathew's case [supra] explained the legal question with regard to the first proviso to
Section 11(3) of the Act, namely, with regard to the burden of proof that "We are of the view landlord
need explain the circumstances and special reasons before the Rent Control Court only if it is
established by the tenant that landlord has got other building of his own". In Janatha Drugs' case
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185245349/ 16M. Basheer vs Remani Gopalan on 16 January, 2014
(supra) is a later decision of a Division Bench of this Court where one of us (Ramachandran Nair, J.)
is a party; wherein it has been held that the burden is on the landlord to plead and prove special
reasons when he gets possession of other rooms. The landlord has got a duty to explain the special
reasons for not choosing to occupy the premises he has come into possession. Special reasons
should be germane to the issue in question and should not be evasive reasons shown by landlord.
R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013
45) The decisions relied upon by Shri C.Varghese Kuriakose in the context of the first proviso to
Section 11(3) are, Jerry Joseph's case [2002 (2) KLT 129 = 2002 KHC 398], Panoli Surendran vs.
P.M.Mammootty [2009 (2) KLT 136], Vayalilakath Abdul Nazar's case [2011 (2) KHC 677], Dasan's
case[2009 (2) KLT 726 = 2009 (2) KHC 613] and M.Padmanabha Setty's case [1966 KHC 711 = AIR
1966 SC 1824].
46) In M.Padmanabha Setty's case (supra) with regard to Section 8(3)(a)(ii) of the Houses Rent and
Accommodation Control Act, 1951 (Mysore), it has been held that landlord's possession of another
building as a tenant is no bar to the eviction of tenant.
47) In Jerry Joseph's case (supra) it was held in paragraph 18 as follows:
"It is now settled that even if the landlord failed to mention in the petition for
eviction about the other premises belonging to him, if materials about those alternate
accommodation have been placed before the court and the matter has been
adequately considered by the court without causing any prejudice to the tenant, the
R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 non disclosure of the availability of buildings in the petition
is immaterial."
48) With regard to the acceptance of special reasons attributed by the landlord, the Division Bench
in Dasan's case [supra], in paragraph (7) has held that it can be any reason which appeals to Rent
Control Court's sense of justice, equity and good conscience and we extract the said portion herein
below:
"......But at the same time, as indicated by Division Bench of this Court in Raghavan v.
Govindan Nambiar, (1995 (1) KLT 596) unless the Rent Control Court finds the
existence of special reasons justifying an order of eviction landlord's possession of
vacant building notwithstanding, order of eviction cannot be passed. Special reason,
according to us, can be any reason which appeals to the Rent Control Court's sense of
justice, equity and good conscience since that court is governed by the principles of
justice, equity and good conscience as provided under the statutory rule 11(8) of
Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Rules while taking decision. .."
49) We will now analyse the evidence in these cases and the arguments of the learned counsel for
the petitioners in the context of the legal position explained by various decisions noted above.
R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185245349/ 17M. Basheer vs Remani Gopalan on 16 January, 2014
50) In the eviction petition, petitioner has pleaded in paragraph (5) that there is a building in
Kalathilparambil road which is jointly owned by the petitioner and her husband and the property
has been attached by the Sales Tax Department and the State Bank of Travancore is also proceeding
with the property for the dues of her husband. It was pleaded that what exactly is the fate of interest
of the petitioner over the said building is a fact not entirely at the disposal of the petitioner and
hence, the said building cannot be used for the bona fide need urged by the landlady. In the chief
affidavit, those aspects have been reiterated.
51) Learned Senior Counsel Shri R.D.Shenoi submitted by referring to the answers in the
cross-examination that the ground floor is in the name of the landlady herein and the answer will
show that at the time of filing of the eviction petition, both the floors were remaining vacant. It is
submitted that since there is no evidence to show that even the portion of the husband has been sold
finally, there is no impediment either at the time of filing of the eviction petition or thereafter for the
landlady to occupy the same.
R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013
52) The above argument is met by the learned counsel Shri Varghese Kuriakose by stating that all
the aspects with regard to the legal proceedings against the building have been explained in the
eviction petition in the proof affidavit and through the three independent evidence of PWs.2 to 4,
and the relevant files concerning the proceedings have also been produced. It is submitted that as
far as special reasons are concerned, the pleadings and evidence will satisfy the requirement of law.
53) In the cross-examination of PW1 she has stated that the building in Kalathilparambil road is
under attachment. Ext.A6 is the notice issued by the Ernakulam Co-operative Bank with regard to
the proceedings under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assests and Enforcement
of Security Interest Act in respect of the building. She has stated that each floors of the building has
an area of 1000 square feet and that the ground floor was under the custody of the Co-operative
Bank and the first floor with the State Bank of Travancore.
54) PW2 is the Special Tahsildar (Revenue Recovery), Kanayannur Taluk who has produced the files
relating the demand R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 notice No.E6-742/ST/01-02. The evidence will show
that the revenue recovery proceedings were initiated in the year 1999-2000 and the defaulter is her
husband. The total arrears is to the tune of `1 crore and proceedings have been initiated against the
properties having 3.164 cents in Survey No.919/1 and 4.228 cents in Sy.No.919/2 and 3.406 cents in
Sy.No.2549/1 and the building therein. With regard to the property in Survey No.2549/1 and the
building situated therein, it is stated that half of the property lying in the western side is in the name
of the husband of the landlady, Shri Gopalan Nair and the remaining half is in the name of the
landlady. Both are owned under separate documents. But, since the building is compact one,
separate boundaries in respect of each person cannot be specified. In respect of the property in
Survey No.919/2, sale was conducted and the property in Survey No.2549/1 has been attached and
the sales proceedings are pending. There is no straight approach from the road to reach the
building. Sale could not be held due to the above reason and as several cases are pending. The
husband of the landlady is absconding. In the cross-examination it is stated that the property of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185245349/ 18M. Basheer vs Remani Gopalan on 16 January, 2014
landlady is not under attachment and proceedings are pending R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 against the
husband. It is also stated that to the portion owned by the landlady there is road frontage.
55) PW4 is the Senior Branch Manager of Ernakulam District Co- operative Bank in the Main
Branch. She has produced the file relating to the loan sanctioned in favour of the landlady and the
loan amount is `14,50,000/-, availed in 2001. Her evidence will show that proceedings have been
initiated under the SARFAESI Act after which `7 lakhs have been remitted in two instalments. The
property offered as security is the property in Survey No.2549/1, namely, 1.21 Are and the portion of
the building situated therein and a Mortgage deed has also been executed. It is stated that the
property has been taken possession by the Bank and Section 13(4) notice was issued under the
SARFAESI Act (Ext.X2 notice) and the loan has not been closed so far.
56) In the cross-examination it is stated that the landlady has challenged the proceedings under the
SARFAESI Act in W.P.(C). No.23894/2009 and thereafter an application for one time settlement
has also been submitted. There is a direction in the Judgment in the writ petition by the High Court
to consider the application for one R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 time settlement and, thereafter, `7
lakhs has been remitted. It is further stated that possession has been taken of the property and not
the building of the landlady, going by Ext.X2. In the re-examination, she clarified that in the
property i.e.1.21 Are, building portion is there.
57) PW3 is the Chief Manager of the Kerala Financial Corporation, Kaloor Branch, who has
produced the file relating to the loan transactions in the name of Siva Krishna Minerals. The said
loans were availed of by the landlady and there are three separate loans of ` 6,02,000/- `1,00,000/-
and `2,32,000/-. The security offered is 21/2 cents in Survey No.701/1 and the loan account has
been closed. There were revenue recovery proceedings pending against the said property for
recovery of the loan amount and during the pendency of the same, under One Time Settlement
Scheme, the amount was paid and the loan was closed on 13/10/2008.
58) The argument raised by the learned Senior Counsel Shri R.D.Shenoi is that going by the
evidence of PW3 it can be seen that the loan with the Kerala Financial Corporation has been closed
and, therefore, there is no real need for eviction of the tenants as the said R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013
building is available. The case of the landlady, as we have already noticed in the eviction petition in
paragraph (2) is that at that time, the revenue recovery proceedings has been started against that
property by the Kerala Financial Corporation, she therefore wanted to shift the press to another
place. The eviction petition was filed on 01/08/2006. The question is whether the conclusion of the
revenue recovery proceedings during the pendency of the eviction petition will go against the said
plea of the landlady, namely, the requirement under Section 11(3) of the Act for residence as well as
for starting a garment making unit. The evidence of PW1 will show that the building where the press
is functioning is a small one with a tin sheet roofing which fact is disclosed in the re-examination. As
far as the requirement of the landlady for the building sought to be evicted under Section 11(3) of the
Act is concerned, the subjective satisfaction of the landlady is material. When she has asserted that
the building is required for residence as well as for starting a garment making unit, even though on a
small scale, the tenant cannot dictate that she should have the residence in the building where the
press is located and the garment making unit can also be located there. The decision relied upon by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185245349/ 19M. Basheer vs Remani Gopalan on 16 January, 2014
the R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 learned counsel for the landlady in this context is Deep Chandra Juneja
vs. Lajwanti Kathuria reported in [(2008) 8 SCC 497=2008 KHC 4898], wherein in paragraph 40 it
has been held that "In Gaya Prasad v. Pradeep Srivastava [(2001) 2 SCC 604], this Court held that
the need of the landlord is to be seen on the date of application for release. In Prativa Devi v. T.V.
Krishnan [(1996) 5 SCC 353], it was held that the landlord is the best judge of his requirement and
courts have no concern to dictate the landlord as to how and in what manner he should live. In Rishi
Kumar Govil v. Maqsoodan & Ors. [(2007) 4 SCC 465], this Court while dealing with the provisions
of Section 21(1)(a) of the U. P. Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972
and Rule 16 of the U. P. Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Rules, 1972,
held that the bona fide personal need of the landlord is a question of fact and should not be normally
interfered with". Herein the need projected is for residence and to start a garment making unit. She
has explained in the oral evidence that conduct of press itself has become difficult because of the
change of circumstances and therefore she R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 wants to have a garment
making unit. With regard to these requirements, the landlady herself is the best judge and the
tenant cannot dictate as to how the landlady will have to adjust. Therefore, we reject the contention
of the learned Senior Counsel in this regard.
59) With regard to the building at Kalathilparambil road, the special reason attributed is that
recovery proceedings are pending against the same. The building is a jointly owned one by the
landlady and her husband. There is no reliable evidence that the building can be separately enjoyed,
and it being a building in two floors, the question is whether the landlady could have ignored the
revenue recovery proceedings against the portion owned by her husband, to start residence therein
in the floor in her name and start a garment making unit. Evidence of PW2 and PW4 will show that
separate recovery proceedings have been initiated with respect to property of the landlady as well as
her husband. With regard to the portion in the name of the landlady, proceedings initiated by the
District Co- operative Bank have not been finalized. Of course, in the eviction petition what she has
pleaded is that the proceedings are pending against the portion owned by her husband. The
proceedings R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 for recovery by the Ernakulam District Co-operative Bank
have been proved in evidence by producing Ext.A6 and by examining PW.4. We are of the view that
no prejudice has been caused to the tenant because of the said aspect. What is of importance is,
whether there is any merit in the special reason offered by the landlady.
60) Thus the special reason shown is the proceedings pending for recovery of loan arrears in respect
of the building, including the portion owned by her. Even though vehement arguments have been
raised on the petitioners side that it cannot be a special reason at all, both the authorities below have
rejected the same. The legal proceedings pending against the property and the building, according to
us is a special reason which is sustainable going by the scheme of the Act and in the light of the
principles we have discussed above. A special reason should be one germane to the issue and it
should be one acceptable to the court dealing with the eviction petition. When a finality has not been
attained as on the date of filing of the eviction petition with regard to the recovery proceedings
involving the property concerned, and even now, it cannot be said that the idea of the landlady to
occupy the tenanted premises against which R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 purportedly no other
proceedings are there, is not bona fide. Therefore, we are not impressed by the argument of the
learned Senior Counsel Shri R.D.Shenoi supported by the learned counsel Shri N.M.Mohamed Ayub
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185245349/ 20M. Basheer vs Remani Gopalan on 16 January, 2014
that the building in Kalathilparambil road and the floor in the name of the landlady is available for
occupation straightaway.
61) Much argument was raised with regard to the residential building of the landlady at Panampilly
Nagar. With regard to the same, it was contended that the plea of the landlady that she has shifted
her residence to the tenanted premises is not correct. This aspect was considered by the Appellate
Authority in paragraph 13 of the Judgment and the argument of the petitioners was rejected.
Reliance was placed on the evidence of P.W.2 in that regard. He had stated that the property in Sy.
No.919/2 is in Panampilly Nagar and the building in it is a residential one. Revenue Recovery
proceedings were taken in respect of the said property. The Appellate Authority therefore observed
that there is no reason to disbelieve the evidence of P.W.2 regarding the taking over of possession of
the residential house at Panampilly Nagar. There was no contra evidence on the part R.C.R.Nos.66
& 69/2013 of the tenants also and accordingly it was held that P.W.1's evidence that she resides in
the address given in the Rent Control Petition is to be accepted. Therefore, we find no reason to
disagree with the above view. It was also argued by Shri Mohamed Ayoob, learned counsel
appearing for one of the petitioners that in Exts.B5 to B7 notices, which were issued prior to Ext.A1
lawyer notice, the need urged is only to shift the Press and therefore it can be presumed that the
landlady's present need, viz. to occupy the building may not be correct. Regarding this aspect, the
Appellate Authority has found in paragraph 19 that the explanation of P.W.1 that only after she lost
her house, she intended to shift her house to the petition schedule building, can be accepted. It was
also observed that there is nothing to show that at the time of sending Exts.B5 to B7 notices, her
house was taken over for the dues to the sale tax department and, therefore, the change in the need
mentioned in Exts.B5 to B7 notices does not warrant a conclusion that her need is not bonafide. We
find no reason to disbelieve the same and hence the said argument is also rejected.
62) Shri N.M.Mohamed Ayub, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner in R.C.R.No.66/2013
had further submitted that the petition R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 schedule building was sought to be
evicted earlier by filing an eviction petition against the then tenant M/s.Jain Automobiles and the
plea therein was also under Section 11(3) of the Act and after getting the building evicted, the
present petitioners-tenants have been inducted which will show that there are no bona fides. It is
answered by learned counsel for the landlady Shri C.Varghese Kuriakose by pointing out that the
bona fide need as pleaded in the eviction petition will have to be gone into by the said court.
63) We find from the order passed by the Rent Control Court that the said aspect has been
examined. In fact, a preliminary objection was raised by one of the tenants with regard to the
maintainability of the eviction petition itself raising the bar under Section 15 of the Act. The same
was rejected and an appeal filed from the order has also been dismissed. The orders show that even
though eviction was sought under Sections 11(3) and 11(4)(iii) of the Act against M/s.Jain
Automobiles, it was allowed only under Section 11(4)(iii) of the Act. At the stage of filing of the
appeal, there was a compromise and the appeal was dismissed as not pressed. It cannot be said that
merely because on an earlier occasion an eviction petition was filed, the plea R.C.R.Nos.66 &
69/2013 for occupation under Section 11(3) of the Act as of now is affected. The landlady has stated
various change of circumstances in the petition and in evidence, while explaining the requirement to
occupy the petition schedule building. Therefore, the said argument is without any merit and we
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/185245349/ 21M. Basheer vs Remani Gopalan on 16 January, 2014
reject the same.
64) The authorities below have found in favour of the landlady with regard to the second proviso to
Section 11(3) of the Act also. It has been found that the burden of proof has not been discharged by
the tenants with regard to these aspects, namely, as to whether they are depending upon the income
from the business for their livelihood and whether any alternate buildings are available in the
locality. We find no reasons to interfere with the same also.
65) For all these reasons, we dismiss the revision petitions. We grant six months time from today to
the petitioners-tenants to vacate the petition schedule building on the following conditions:
a. The petitioners will file an affidavit within one month undertaking to vacate the
petition schedule premises within the time granted by this Court, before the
Execution Court or the Rent Control Court as the case may be .
R.C.R.Nos.66 & 69/2013 b. They will continue to pay the same monthly rent for use
and occupation till the vacant possession is handed over. If any of the conditions are
violated, the petitioners will not be entitled for the benefit of this order.
66) We record our deep appreciation of the learned arguments raised by learned
Senior Counsel Shri R.D.Shenoi, learned counsel Shri N.M.Mohamed Ayub and Shri
C.Varghese Kuriakose. No costs.
