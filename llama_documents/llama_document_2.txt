In India, particularly Kerala, land scams are in the increase. Bogus pattas, sale deeds executed by
persons other than the actual owners of the property, grabbing of government property etc. have
been coming to light frequently during the last few years. It has been proved to be extremely difficult
to contain this menace. The imbroglio of Munnar lands, which continues to vex the executive
indefinitely, is the classic example on point. Legislatures of many States, including the State of
Kerala, have brought in amendments to the Registration Act to counter this menace by insisting on
photographs and thumb impressions of both the sellers and purchasers in the sale deeds presented
for registration. It is in this backdrop that courts are experiencing another malpractice in the real
estate sector, in the form of sellers getting deeds of cancellation of the sales registered on some
pretext or other, some of them years after the execution of the sale deeds, creating a serious
situation for bona fide purchasers having to inhabit the corridors of civil courts for years to get such
illegal cancellation deeds, got registered taking advantage of the loopholes in the Registration Acts
and Rules, annulled by due process of law, which prima facie would go to show that even when the
registering authority knows that the former vendor has no authority to execute the same, they are
compelled to register the same. Going by the cases coming up before the High Court itself, not to
mention those before the lower courts, cases of registration of such cancellation deeds and requests
for change of mutation of land records on the basis of such illegal cancellation deeds, are on the
increase, forcing courts to take a second look at the legal position as to whether registering officers
should refuse to register such deeds of cancellation of sale deeds. At least two High Courts have
considered this very question and have come up with differing opinions on this question and in one
of them, different judges of the same bench of a High Court considering this vexing question, have
come up with differing opinions. The very same question has come up for decision of this court in
these two cases. Needless to say, the question is of considerable public importance also, which
prompted me to get the assistance of an amicus curiae in resolving the issue posed before me,
despite the fact that competent counsel are appearing on both sides, so that I can get an unbiased
view as well.
2. Before going into the questions involved, I shall briefly note the facts of the two cases before me as
presented in the writ petitions. In W.P.(C). No.34367/09, the 4th respondent, who is none other
than the uncle of the petitioner, executed and got registered Ext. P1 sale deed dated 9-1-1996
assigning the properties described in the schedule to the said deed in favour of the petitioner. After
more than 13= years of execution of the sale deed, the 4th respondent executed and got registered
Ext. P3 cancellation deed dated 1-8-2009, cancelling Ext. P1 sale deed, on the ground that the
petitioner has not paid the balance sale consideration agreed upon, although in Ext P1 sale deed he
had acknowledged receipt of the full sale consideration mentioned therein, that too after suffering
an injunction order in O.S. No. 84/2009 filed before the Munsiff's Court, Kuthuparamba, by the
petitioner, against interfering with the peaceful enjoyment of the property by the petitioner. The
petitioner is challenging the registration of Ext. P1 deed of cancellation of sale deed on the ground
that the 3rd respondent-registering officer ought not to have registered the same under law. In
W.P.(C).No. 37150/09, the 3rd respondent executed and got registered Ext P1 sale deed on 28-10-
2008 and got Ext P2 cancellation deed dated 24-11-2009 registered, on the grounds that the
petitioner has not paid the sale consideration and the property has not been given possession of, to
the petitioner, although in Ext. P1 sale deed it has been specifically admitted by the 3rd respondent
to the contrary. The action of the 2nd respondent- registering officer in registering the cancellation
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/397599/ 2Pavakkal Noble John vs Kerala State on 3 September, 2010
deed is assailed on the ground that, by registering Ext.P2 cancellation deed the registering officer is
practically reversing or removing Ext.P1 sale deed, for which he has no power, since he has become
functus officio on registration of Ext. P1 sale deed.
3. Elaborate arguments have been advanced by counsel on both sides and the amicus curiae. I have
considered the same in detail. As I have already indicated, the question to be answered in these writ
petitions is as to whether the registering officer, under the Registration Act, 1908, has powers to and
is duty bound to refuse to register a deed of cancellation cancelling a sale deed. I shall straight away
proceed to consider the issues involved without narrating the arguments of counsel separately.
4. The Registration Act, 1908, does not contain any specific provision laying down the circumstances
under which the sub- registrar can refuse to register a document presented for registration before
him. But the fact that he has power to refuse to register a document presented for registration before
him is clear from Section 71 of the Act, which reads thus:
"71. Reasons for refusal to register to be recorded.--- (1) Every Sub-Registrar refusing
to register a document, except on the ground that the property to which it relates is
not situate within his sub-district, shall make an order of refusal and record his
reasons for such order in his Book No.2, and endorse the words "registration refused"
on the document; and, on application made by any person executing or claiming
under the document, shall without payment and unnecessary delay, give him a copy
of the reasons so recorded.
(2) No registering officer shall accept for registration a document so endorsed unless
and until, under the provisions hereinafter contained, the document is directed to be
registered."
But Chapter XXIII, particularly Rule 191 therein, of the Registration Rules (Kerala) framed by the
Inspector General of Registration under Section 69(2) of the Registration Act, 1908, and published
in the Kerala Gazette on 27-12-1958, does give some indication as to for what reasons the
sub-registrar can refuse registration of documents presented for registration, which Rule reads thus:
"191. The reasons for refusal will usually come under one or more of the heads
mentioned below; which should invariably be quoted as authority for refusal.
Section 19 I. That the document is written in a language which the Registering Officer
does not understand and which is not commonly used in the district, and that it is
unaccompanied by a true translation and a true copy.
Section 20 II. That it contains unattested interlineations, blanks, erasures, or
alterations which in the opinion of the Registering Officer require to be attested.
Section 21 (1-3) and Section 22 III. That the description of the property is insufficient
to identify it.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/397599/ 3Pavakkal Noble John vs Kerala State on 3 September, 2010
Section 21(4) IV. That the document is unaccompanied by a copy or copies of any
map or plan which it contains.
Rule 41 V. That the date of execution is not stated in the document or that the correct
date is not ascertainable.
Sections 23, 24, 25, 26, 72, 75 and 77 VI. That it is presented after the prescribed
time.
Sections 32, 33, 40 and 43 VII. That it is presented by a person who has no right to
present it.
Section 32A VIIA. That the document is not affixed with the Passport size
photographs and impression/impressions of the left thumb or any of the fingers in
the absence of left thumb as prescribed in Rule 30A(i) and (ii).
Section 34 VIII. That the executing parties or their representatives, assigns, or agents
have failed to appear within the prescribed time.
Note:- 'Prescribed time', shall mean the time allowed for presentation under Sections
23, 24, 25 and 26 and not the delay of four months in appearance which may be
condoned under the proviso to Section 34, unless the presentant or the executing
party concerned applies for extension of the period on proper grounds or takes action
under Section 36.
Sections 34 and 43 IX. That the Registering Officer is not satisfied as to the identity
of a person appearing before him who alleges that he has executed the document.
Sections 34 and 40 X. That the Registering Officer is not satisfied as to the right of a
person appearing as a representative, assign or agent so to appear.
Section 35 XI. That execution is denied by any person purporting to be an executing
party or by his agent.
Note:- When a Registering Officer is satisfied that an executant is purposely keeping
out of the way with a view to evade registration of a document or has gone to a distant
place and is not likely to return to admit execution within the prescribed time,
registration may be refused, the non-appearance being treated as tantamount to
denial of execution.
Section 35 XII. That the person purporting to have executed the document is a minor,
an idiot or a lunatic.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/397599/ 4Pavakkal Noble John vs Kerala State on 3 September, 2010
Note:- When the executant of a document who is examined under a commission
under Section 38 of the Act is reported by the Commissioner to be a minor, an idiot
or a lunatic, registration may be refused, and it is not necessary that the Registering
Officer should personally examine the executant to satisfy himself as to the existence
of the disqualification.
Section 35 XIII. That execution is denied by the representative or assign of a
deceased person by whom the documents purports to have been executed.
Note:- When some of the representatives of a deceased executant admit and others
deny execution, the registration of the document shall be refused in toto, the persons
interested being let to apply to the Registrar for an enquiry into the fact of execution.
Sections 35 and 41 XIV. That the alleged death of a person by whom the document
purports to have been executed has not been proved.
Section 41 XV. That the Registering Officer is not satisfied as to the fact of execution
in the case of a will or of an authority to adopt presented after the death of the
testator or donor.
Sections 25, 34 and 80 XVI. That the prescribed fee or fine has not been paid.
XVII. That the full additions of all persons executing and of all persons claiming
under the document are not given.
XVIII. A Kanam demise or a renewal thereof shall be refused registrations if it does
not contain the following particulars:
(i) The name if any, the description and the extent of each item of holding;
(ii) The Government tax payable on each item;
(iii) The renewal fee if any paid. If no renewal fee is paid the fact should be stated;
and
(iv) The settlement pattam, the settlement patta, michavaram, the Jenmivaram and
the Jenmikaram in respect of the land or each of the several parcels of land
comprised in the holding.
Rule 67 XIX. That the executing parties do not get the status of married couple as per the document
styled as marriage agreement." In my opinion the reasons mentioned therein, for which the
registering authority can refuse to register a document presented before him for registration, are not
exhaustive, since the Rule itself says that the reasons for refusal shall usually come under one or
more of the heads mentioned therein, which would indicate that there can be other valid reasons for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/397599/ 5Pavakkal Noble John vs Kerala State on 3 September, 2010
refusal not enumerated therein as well. But Rule 67 of the Registration Rules (Kerala) provides thus:
"67. It forms no part of a Registering Officer's duty to enquire into the validity of a
document except documents styled as marriage agreement brought to him for
registration or to attend any written or verbal protest against the registration of a
document based on the ground that the executing party had no right to execute the
document; but he is bound to consider objections raised on any of the grounds stated
below:-
(a) That the parties appearing or about to appear before him are not the persons they
profess to be;
(b) That the document is forged;
(c) That the person appearing as a representative, assign or agent, has no right to
appear in that capacity.
(d) That the executing party is not really dead, as alleged by the party applying for
registration; or
(e) That the executing party is minor or an idiot or a lunatic."
5. Therefore the question to be considered is as to whether the sub-registrar can refuse registration
on the ground that the party who executes the document has no legal right to execute the document
and whether the sub-registrar can examine the validity of the document presented for registration.
Chapter XIB of the Rules prescribes the enquiry to be conducted by the sub-registrar before
registering a document, which would give some indication as to the type of enquiry he can conduct
before registering a document, which has been framed under Section 35, which reads thus:
"35. Procedure on admission and denial of execution respectively:- (1)(a) If all the
persons executing the document appear personally before the Registering Officer and
are personally known to him, or if he be otherwise satisfied that they are the persons
they represent themselves to be, and if they all admit the execution of the document,
or
(b) if in the case of any person appearing by a representative, assign or agent, such
representative, assign or agent admits the execution, or
(c) if the person executing the document is dead, and his representative or assign
appears before the Registering Officer and admits the execution, the Registering
Officer shall register the document as directed in Sections 58 to 61, inclusive.
(2) The Registering Officer may, in order to satisfy himself that the persons appearing
before him are the persons they represent themselves to be, or for any other purpose
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/397599/ 6Pavakkal Noble John vs Kerala State on 3 September, 2010
contemplated by this Act, examine any one present in his office.
(3)(a) if any person by whom the document purports to be executed denies its
execution, or
(b) if any such person appears to the Registering Officer to be a minor, an idiot or a
lunatic, or
(c) if any person by whom the document purports to be executed is dead, and his
representative or assign denies its execution, the Registering Officer shall refuse to
register the document as to the person so denying, appearing or dead:
Provided that, where such officer is a Registrar, he shall follow the procedure
prescribed in Part XII:
Provided further that the State Government may by notification in the Official
Gazette declare that any Sub-Registrar named in the notification shall, in respect of
documents the execution of which is denied, be deemed to be a Registrar for the
purposes of this sub-section and of Part XII."
6. These provisions would go to show that the registering Officer can enquire as to whether the
person executing the document is the person who represents himself to be. In this connection
Section 32 of the Act relating to persons who can present a document for registration is also
relevant, which reads thus:
"32. Persons to present documents for registration:-
Except in the cases mentioned in Sections 31, 88 and 89, every document to be
registered under this Act, whether such registration be compulsory or optional, shall
be presented at the proper registration office,-
(a) By some person executing or claiming under the same, or, in the case of a copy of
a decree or order, claiming under the decree or order, or
(b) by the representative or assign of such a person, or
(c) by the agent of such a person, representative or assign, duly authorized by
power-of-attorney executed and authenticated in manner hereinafter mentioned."
Since what we are dealing with is the question of transfer of property, and persons competent to
execute documents in respect of immovable property, Section 7 of the Transfer of Property Act,
1882, defining persons competent to transfer property is also very relevant, which reads thus:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/397599/ 7Pavakkal Noble John vs Kerala State on 3 September, 2010
"7. Persons competent to transfer.-- Every person competent to contract and entitled
to transferable property, or authorised to dispose of transferable property not his
own, is competent to transfer such property either wholly or in part, and either
absolutely or conditionally, in the circumstances, to the extent and in the manner,
allowed and prescribed by any law for the time being in force."
Section 8 of the Transfer of Property deals with the question as to when transfer of property takes
effect, which reads as follows:
"8. Operation of transfer.-- Unless a different intention is expressed or necessarily
implied, a transfer of property passes forthwith to the transferee all the interest
which the transferor is then capable of passing in the property and in the legal
incidents thereof.
Such incidents include, where the property is land, the easements annexed thereto,
the rents and profits thereof accruing after the transfer, and all things attached to the
earth;
and, where the property is machinery attached to the earth, the movable parts
thereof;
and, where the property is a house, the easements annexed thereto, the rent thereof
accruing after the transfer, and the locks, keys, bars, doors, windows, and all other
things provided for permanent use therewith;
and, where the property is a debt or other actionable claim, the securities therefor
(except where they are also for other debts or claims not transferred to the
transferee), but not arrears of interest accrued before the transfer;
and, where the property is money or other property yielding income, the interest or
income thereof accruing after the transfer takes effect."
7. I shall now proceed to consider the issue in the light of the above legal provisions applicable. At
the outset, I may briefly note the object of the system of registration of documents relating to
property. Somewhat recently, the Supreme Court had occasion to consider the same in State of H.P.
and Others V Shivalik Agro Poly Products and others, (2004) 8 Supreme Court Cases 556. In
paragraphs 5 to 7 of that decision the Supreme Court has observed thus:
"5. By the very nature of things recognition of rights or title over immovable property
and transactions therein give rise to manifold problems. Movable property,
depending upon its size or dimension, can be kept in absolute control in possession
of its owner and a third party may not be in a position even to know where the same
has been kept. But this is not so for an immovable property which lies in the open,
attached to the earth at a particular place and the owner may be residing at a faraway
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/397599/ 8Pavakkal Noble John vs Kerala State on 3 September, 2010
place. The owner may give the property on lease or licence to some one else who may
get physical possession thereof and enjoy the usufruct thereof. In order to get over
this difficulty, a system of registration of title to immovable property has been
evolved which is followed in many countries. In United States the legal position has
been described as under in Corpus juris Secundum, Vol.76, p.525:
"Systems looking toward the registration of titles to land, as distinguished from the
practice under Recording Acts generally of recording or registering the evidence of
such title, are in effect by virtue of statute in several of the United States, and the
courts are bound by such provisions rather than by any doctrine of the common law
which is in contravention thereof. These systems are quite generally known as
'Torrens Systems' and the statutes providing therefore as "Torrens Acts' from the
name of the author of the Australian Act of 1857, the underlying principle of which
they follow. These systems are limited in their application to titles to land.
The prominent object of such legislation is the establishment of a method whereby
the title to a particular tract or parcel of real estate will always be ascertainable by
reference to a register of conclusive veracity, maintained by the designated public
official. In other words, the purpose of these laws is to simplify the transfer of real
estate, and to render titles thereto safe and indefeasible through the registration of
such titles, the bringing together in one place of all of the facts relative to the title to
each particular tract which is registered, and the use of certificates which shall
conclusively show at all times the state of such title and the person in whom it is
vested. The Torrens system serves a broader purpose than merely to notify the record
owner of instruments affecting the title; it is notice to all the world of the condition of
the title."
6. The position in the United Kingdom has been described in Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol.26,
paras 701 and 705 as under:
"701. Legislation referable to centrally maintained register.-
The legislation relating to registration of the title is directed to the manner in which
the law and practice of conveyancing are to be adapted to the use of a centrally
maintained register of title to land. As the use of the register has been extended, so
the successive statutes mark the historical development of a system of conveyancing,
commonly known as registered conveyancing, which approached maturity as part of
the real property legislation of 1925.
The result of that legislation, as respects registered land, is to produce on first
registration as State-insured record of entitlement to legal estates in land, open to
public inspection, which is to be kept up to date in respect of subsequent transactions
in accordance with the conveyancing technique for which the legislation provides.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/397599/ 9Pavakkal Noble John vs Kerala State on 3 September, 2010
Indirect reference to the earlier legislation is found at the commencement of the Land
Registration Act, 1925 in the provision that requires the Chief Land Register to
continue to keep a register of title to freehold and leasehold land.
* * *
705. The Land Registry Act, 1862.- The Land Registry Act, 1862 marked the first
attempt to introduce registration of title as distinct from registration of deeds by
memorial. Registration was on a voluntary basis and subject to conditions, which
included conditions (1) that a marketable title should be shown; (2) that the
boundaries of the land should be officially determined and defined as against
adjoining owners; and (3) that partial interests should be disclosed and registered.
The Act continues to apply to estates registered under it as if the Land Registration
Act, 1925 had not been passed, until such time as those estates are registered
pursuant to the Act of 1925. The intention that the registration of such estates is to be
transferred to the modern register is confirmed by power given to the Lord
Chancellor to provide by order that all titles registered under the Land Registry Act,
1862 should be registered under the Land Registration Act, 1925 without cost to the
parties interested".
7. The law relating to transfer of immovable property in Indian is contained in the Transfer of
Property Act, 1882. Section 54 of this Act defines "sale" and it provides that transfer of ownership in
the case of intangible immovable property of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards can be
made only by a registered instrument. Section 107 provides that a lease of immovable property from
year to year, or for any term exceeding one year or reserving a yearly rent, can be made only by a
registered instrument. Similarly, Section 123 provides that a gift of immovable property must be
effected by a registered instrument. Section 17 of the Registration Act gives a long list of instruments
for which registration is compulsory and clause (b) of sub-section (1) provides that non-
testamentary instruments which purport or operate to create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish,
whether in present or in future, any right, title or interest, whether vested or contingent, of the value
of one hundred rupees and upwards, to or in immovable property must be registered. These
statutory provisions indicate the importance of registration of documents. In fact, it will be
impossible to have any transaction relating to immovable property in any manner like transfer, gift,
giving on lease or creating a mortgage, etc. without a system of registration of documents.............."
(Underlining supplied) Therefore we have to consider the issue in the light of the object of the
legislation as explained in the above decision, which is to establish a method whereby the title to a
particular tract or parcel of land will always be ascertainable by reference to the register maintained
in the sub-registrar's office, which should be of conclusive veracity, which may not be achieved if the
sub registrar is to register all and sundry documents presented by whom whatsoever.
8. The question as to whether title to a property passes to the purchaser on registration of the sale
deed, even if no amount has been paid towards sale consideration to the vendor, has been
considered by the Supreme Court in Kaliperumal V Rajgopal and another, (2009) 4 Supreme Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/397599/ 10Pavakkal Noble John vs Kerala State on 3 September, 2010
Cases 193, holding thus:
"14. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at length and considered the
evidence - oral and documentary, forming part of the record.
15. The question posed for our consideration is whether title to the disputed
properties passed to appellant when the sale deed dated 26-6-1983 was registered on
26-10-1983, though admittedly no amount was paid towards consideration to the
respondents.
16. Sale is defined as being a transfer of ownership for a price. In a sale there is an
absolute transfer of all rights in the properties sold. No rights are left in the
transferor. The price is fixed by the contract antecedent to the conveyance. Price is
the essence of a contract of sale. There is only one mode of transfer by sale in regard
to immovable property of the value of Rs.100 or more and that is by a registered
instrument.
17. It is now well settled that payment of entire price is not a condition precedent for
completion of the sale by passing of title, as Section 54 of the Transfer of Property
Act, 1882 ("the Act", for short) defines "sale" as "a transfer of ownership in exchange
for a price paid or promised or part-paid and part-promised". If the intention of
parties was that title should pass on execution and registration, title would pass to the
purchaser even if the sale price or part thereof is not paid. In the event of
non-payment of price (or balance price as the case may be) thereafter, the remedy of
the vendor is only to sue for the balance price. He cannot avoid the sale. He is,
however, entitled to a charge upon the property for the unpaid part of the sale price
where the ownership of the property has passed to the buyer before payment of the
entire price, under Section 55(4) (b) of the Act.
18. Normally, ownership and title to the property will pass to the purchaser on
registration of the sale deed with effect from the date of execution of the sale deed.
But this is not an invariable rule, as the true test of passing of property is the
intention of parties.
Though registration is prima facie proof of an intention to transfer the property, it is not proof of
operative transfer if payment of consideration (price) is a condition precedent for passing of the
property.
19. The answer to the question whether the parties intended that transfer of the ownership should
be merely by execution and registration of the deed or whether they intended the transfer of the
property to take place, only after receipt of the entire consideration, would depend on the intention
of the parties. Such intention is primarily to be gathered and determined from the recitals of the sale
deed. When the recitals are insufficient or ambiguous the surrounding circumstances and conduct of
parties can be looked into for ascertaining the intention, subject to the limitations placed by Section
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/397599/ 11Pavakkal Noble John vs Kerala State on 3 September, 2010
92 of the Evidence Act".
9. I can straightaway say that since the object of the Registration Act is to establish a method
whereby the title to a particular tract or parcel of land will always be ascertainable by reference to
the register maintained by the sub registrar's office, which should be of conclusive veracity, and the
vendor cannot avoid the sale even if any part of the sale consideration has not been paid, if the
intention of the parties gatherable from the sale deed is that title should pass, registration of a
cancellation deed cancelling the sale deed unilaterally by the vendor, would certainly defeat that
object.
10. I shall now deal with the duty of the sub-registrar in the matter of registration of a cancellation
deed unilaterally executed by the vendor in the light of the above legal position. Under Section 7 of
the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, for a person to become competent to transfer property, two
conditions have to be satisfied viz. (1) he has to be competent to contract and (2) he must be entitled
to transferable property or he must be authorised to dispose of transferable property not his own.
Section 32 of the Registration Act, 1908, details the persons who can present documents for
registration, who shall be either the person executing the document or his representative or assign
or the agent of such a person duly authorised by power of attorney. The provisions of Rule 191 have
to be appreciated in the light of the above provisions. Sub clause XII of Rule 191 lays down that the
registering officer can refuse registration for the reason that the person purporting to have executed
the document is a minor, an idiot or a lunatic. This reason relates to the competency of the person to
contract, which is the 1st condition laid down in Section 7 of the Transfer of Property Act. Sub clause
X of Rule 191 lays down that the registering officer can refuse registration for the reason that he is
not satisfied as to the right of the person appearing as a representative, assign or agent so to appear.
This reason relates to sub sections (b) and (c) of Section 32 of the Registration Act and the latter
part of condition no. 2 in Section 7 of Transfer of Property Act. Therefore essentially, as far as
transfer of immovable property is concerned, the Registration Act and Rules are framed in terms of
the Transfer of Property Act itself. Therefore I am of opinion that want of capacity to transfer
property as stipulated in Section 7 of the Transfer of Property Act, should also be a reason for which
the sub-registrar can refuse registration of a document relating to transfer of property. In fact that is
exactly what has been provided for by sub clause VII of Rule 191, making it competent for the
sub-registrar to refuse registration for the reason that the document is presented by a person who
has no right to present it. As far as transfer of property is concerned under Section 7 of the Transfer
of Property Act, 1882 only a person who is entitled to transferable property is competent to transfer
property. Under Section 32 of the Registration Act, 1908, the document shall be presented by the
person executing the document, if he is presenting the document himself. Therefore, if a person is
not entitled to transferable property, he cannot execute a document in respect of transfer of the
property and therefore he is not a person competent to present such a document for registration.
Under sub Clause VII of Rule 191 of the Rules, the sub-registrar can validly refuse registration of a
document if it is presented by a person who has no right to present it. By cancelling a sale deed
executed by him earlier, the vendor is actually attempting to retransfer the property to himself,
which he cannot do, since he is no longer entitled to that property as the title had already passed to
the purchaser on the execution of the sale deed unless the sale deed stipulates otherwise and for
becoming entitled to be competent to execute a document in respect of that property he has to first
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/397599/ 12Pavakkal Noble John vs Kerala State on 3 September, 2010
get the earlier sale deed annulled by a court of law. On reading of all these provisions together, I am
satisfied that a registering authority can refuse registration, if, on a cursory enquiry, it is clear that
the person purporting to have executed the cancellation deed is not the person entitled to the
property as on the date of execution. This he can easily do by merely looking at the document and
the previous documents registered in respect of the property as per the register available in his office
in respect of the property, which would show who is the present owner of the property. Section 35 of
the Act indicates that such an enquiry is not alien to the powers and duties of the sub-registrar.
Going by Section 34 of the Indian Registration Act and Rule 67 of the Registration Rules (Kerala), at
first blush it may appear that the registering officer cannot enquire into the validity of the document
or the right of the executing party to execute the document. But to hold that under no circumstances
the registering officer shall enquire into the competency of the person to execute the document and
he shall blindly register the document except for the reasons mentioned in Rule 191, would lead to
very disastrous and anomalous results. Take for example a case where a person presents for
registration a sale deed executed by him selling the property comprised of the High Court or any
government property for that matter; or an agreement between two persons whereby one agrees to
kill a third person for consideration. Is the registering officer bound to register the same? If that is
the position of law, then a cancellation deed cancelling any document by any person who has no
relation to the property also will have to be registered if the reasons mentioned in Rule 191 are not
available. That cannot be the object of the abovesaid provisions. But that does not mean that the
sub-registrar can make a roving enquiry to decide the validity of the document or the right of the
executants to execute the document. A reasonable interpretation commensurate with the object of
the Act and Rules would be that if by reading the document and looking at the previous documents
registered in respect of the property he is satisfied that the document cannot be validly executed by
the person purporting to have executed the same, he has to refuse to register the same and act in
accordance with Section 71 of the Act. Therefore, I am of the opinion that by refusing to register a
deed of cancellation of a sale deed, the sub-registrar is only performing a duty cast upon him by the
Registration Act and Rules, notwithstanding Rule 67 of the Registration Rules (Kerala) and the
same is in consonance with the object of the Registration Act and Rules as elucidated above.
11. A contrary interpretation would be opposed to public policy also. The meaning to be assigned to
the phrase "public policy" and the power of the courts to determine as to the factors of public policy
which may form the basis for interference with a contract or award has been subject matter of
several decisions of the Supreme Court in the context of Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act and
Section 34 (2)
(b) (ii) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. In Muralidhar Aggarwal V State of U.P., (1974) 2
Supreme Court Cases 472, while dealing with the concept of `public policy' the Supreme Court
observed thus:
"31. Public policy does not remain static in any given community. It may vary from
generation to generation and even in the same generation. Public policy would be
almost useless if it were to remain in fixed moulds for all time.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/397599/ 13Pavakkal Noble John vs Kerala State on 3 September, 2010
32. . . . The difficulty of discovering what public policy is at any given moment
certainly does not absolve the Judges from the dut of doing so. In conducting an
enquiry, as already stated, Judges are not hidebound by precedent. The Judges must
look beyond the narrow field of past precedents, though this still leaves open the
question, in which direction they must cast their gaze. The Judges are to base their
decisions on the opinions of men of the world, as distinguished from opinions based
on legal learning. In other words, the Judges will have to look beyond the
jurisprudence and that in so doing, they must consult not their own personal
standards or predilections but those of the dominant opinion at a given moment, or
what has been termed customary morality. The Judges must consider the social
consequences of the rule propounded, especially in the light of the factual evidence
available as to its probable results. . . . The point is rather that this power must be
lodged somewhere and under our Constitution and laws, it has been lodged in the
Judges and if they have to fulfil their function as Judges, it could hardly be lodged
elsewhere."
In Central Inland Water Transport Corpn. Ltd. V Brojo Nath Ganguly, AIR 1986 SC 1571, the
Supreme Court held thus:
"92. The Indian Contract Act does not define the expression 'public policy' or
'opposed to public policy. From the very nature of things, the expressions 'public
policy', 'opposed to public policy' or 'contrary to public policy' are incapable of precise
definition. Public policy, however, is not the policy of a particular Government. It
connotes some matter which concerns the public good and the public interest. The
concept of what is for the public good or in the public interest or what would be
injurious or harmful to the public good or the public interest has varied from time to
time. As new concepts take the place of old, transactions, which were once considered
against public policy are now being upheld by the courts and similarly where there
has been a well-recognized head of public policy, he courts have not shirked from
extending it to new transactions and changed circumstances and have at times not
even flinched from inventing a new head of public policy. There are two schools of
thought - 'the narrow view' school and 'the broad view' school. According to the
former, courts cannot create new heads of public policy whereas the latter
countenances judicial law-making in this area. The adherents of 'the narrow view'
school would not invalidate a contract on the ground of public policy unless that
particular ground had been well established by authorities. Hardly ever has the voice
of he timorous spoken more clearly and loudly than in these words of Lord Davey in
Jenson v. Driefontein Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd.: (1902 AC 484) 'public policy is
always an unsafe and treacherous ground for legal decision.' That was in the year
1902. Seventy-eight years earlier, Burrough, J., in Richardson v. Mellish, (1824) 2
Bing 229) described public policy as 'a very unruly horse, and when once you get
astride it you never know where it will carry you'. The master of the Rolls, Lord
Denning, however, was not a man to shy away from unmanageable horses and in
words which conjure up before our eyes the picture of the young Alexander the Great
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/397599/ 14Pavakkal Noble John vs Kerala State on 3 September, 2010
taming Bucephalous, he said in Enderby Town Football Club Ltd. v. Football Assn.
Ltd. (1971 Ch
591): 'With a good man in the saddle, the unruly horse can be kept in control. It can
jump over obstacles'. Had the timorous always held the field, not only the doctrine of
public policy but even the common law or the principles of equity would never have
evolved.
Sir William Holdsworth in his 'History of English Law', Vol. III, p. 55, has said:
'In fact, a body of law like the common law, which has grown up gradually with the
growth of the nation, necessarily acquires some fixed principles, and if it is to
maintain these principles it must be able, on the ground of public policy or some
other like ground, to suppress practices which, under ever new disguises, seek to
weaken or negative them.' It is thus clear that the principles governing public policy
must be and are capable, on proper occasion, of expansion or modification. Practices
which were considered perfectly normal at one time have today become obnoxious
and oppressive to public conscience. If there is no head of public policy which covers
a case, then the court must in consonance with public conscience and in keeping with
public good and public interest declare such practice to be opposed to public policy.
Above all, in deciding any case which may not be covered by authority our courts
have before them the beacon light of the preamble to the Constitution. Lacking
precedent, the court can always be guided by that light and the principles underlying
the fundamental rights and the directive principles enshrined in our Constitution."
In Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. V Saw Pipes Ltd., (2003) 5 Supreme Court
Cases 705, in which the above two decisions were also referred to, the Supreme Court
held thus:
"16. The next clause which requires interpretation is clause
(ii) of sub-section (2)(b) of Section 34 which inter alia provides that the court may set
aside the arbitral award if it is in conflict with the "public policy of India". The phase
"public policy of India" is not defined under the Act. Hence, the said term is required
to be given meaning in context and also considering the purpose of the section and
scheme of the Act. It has been repeatedly stated by various authorities that the
expression "public policy" does not admit of precise definition and may vary from
generation to generation and from time to time. Hence, the concept "public policy" is
considered to be vague, susceptible to narrow or wider meaning depending upon the
context in which it is used. Lacking precedent, the court has to give its meaning in the
light and principles underlying the Arbitration Act, Contract Act and constitutional
provisions."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/397599/ 15Pavakkal Noble John vs Kerala State on 3 September, 2010
In this connection it is useful to refer to the decision of the Supreme Court in State of Rajasthan V
Basant Nahata, AIR 2005 SC 3401, wherein the jurisdiction and desirability of the courts
interpreting statutory provisions and contract in the anvil of `public policy' has been elaborately
dealt with, by referring to commentaries of Indian and English authors as also all the previous
decisions of the Supreme Court on the subject. In paragraphs 37, 38 and 39, the Supreme Court held
thus:
"37. The words 'Public policy' or 'opposed to public policy', inter alia, find reference in
Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act. Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of Foreign Awards
(Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961, Section 3(1) of U.P. (Temporary Control of
Rent and Evictions) Act, 1947 and Section 34(2)(b)(ii) of Arbitration and Conciliation
Act, 1996.
38. By reason of the said provisions the judiciary has been conferred with power to
determine as to the factors of public policy which may form the basis for interference
with a contract or award.
39. It may not be necessary for us to deal with extensively the case laws dealing with
the relevant provisions of the said statutes but it would not, in our opinion, be correct
to contend that public policy is capable of being given a precise definition. What is
'opposed to public policy' would be a matter depending upon the nature of the
transaction. The pleadings of the parties and the materials brought on record would
be relevant so as to enable the court to judge the concept as to what is for public good
or in the public interest or what would be injurious or harmful to the public good or
the public interest at the relevant point of time as contra- distinguished from the
policy of a particular government. A law dealing with the rights of a citizen is
required to be clear and unambiguous. Doctrine of public policy is contained in a
branch of common law, it is governed by precedents."
12. In view of these precedents, I am of opinion that it is only appropriate for this court to interpret
the not so clear and latently inconsistent provisions of the Registration Act and Rules, in tune with
public policy.
13. It is no secret that land mafias are on the prowl in the country, especially in the State of Kerala.
Litigation to set aside such cancellation deeds are increasing not only in the civil courts but also the
High Court. As is clear from the decision of the Madras High Court in G.D. Subramaniam V. The
Sub-Registrar Konur, 2009 (1) CTC 209 = 2009 CIJ 243 Madras, the situation in the State of
Tamilnadu is also not different. In that decision it is said thus in paragraph 9:
"9. Complaints, in plenty, flood the police stations in the State of Tamil Nadu very
often, in recent times, alleging that, unscrupulous sellers and land grabbers, indulge
in nullifying the valid sale made by means of registered sale deeds, by executing
cancellation deeds unilaterally and getting the same registered in an ingenious way.
The modus operandi is, this court is informed, that unscrupulous elements like land
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/397599/ 16Pavakkal Noble John vs Kerala State on 3 September, 2010
grabbers approach the former owners of properties, practice a kind of deception by
paying paltry amounts, induce them to execute cancellation deeds without the
knowledge and consent of the purchasers and then to execute fresh sale deeds in their
favour. It is, indeed, a fraud. Based on such sale deeds, these mighty people squat
upon the properties thereby depriving the real owners, who are generally meek, from
enjoying the properties thereby leaving them in the lurch. It is also common
knowledge that the doors of subordinate Courts are knocked at with number of Civil
Suits where the real owners have to fight for justice to get their title declared as
against these unscrupulous elements. Going by the past experience, the Civil Suits, in
normal course, take years to conclude. In the meanwhile, it also happens that some
more encumbrance is made thereby creating further cloud in the title so as to make
the issues more complex and complicated."
In the Full Bench decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Yalana Malleswari V Anathula
Sayamma, AIR 2007 AP 57, a similar situation has been dealt with. The State of Rajasthan tried a
different line by introducing a new section 22A in the Act, which was declared as unconstitutional by
the Supreme Court in Basant Nahata's case (supra). This would give an indication that this malady
is increasing in other parts of the country as well, which warrants a purposive interpretation of the
Registration Act and Rules in consonance with public policy to contain the same.
14. The very object of the Registration Act, as I have already explained, is to establish a method
whereby the title to a particular tract or parcel of land will always be ascertainable by reference to
the register maintained by the sub registrar's office, which should be of conclusive veracity. That
object would be defeated if cancellation deeds cancelling sale deeds are allowed to be registered
automatically. It would lead to chaos in the matter of ascertaining the title of properties by
inspecting the register relating to properties maintained in the sub-registrar's office. Intending
purchasers of land and Banks, other financial institutions and others who would like to advance
money on the security of immovable properties would find it extremely difficult to ascertain title of
the seller/mortgagor in respect of the property offered for sale/as security. Registered sale deed duly
executed by a party in favour of another and the register in which the same is shown as registered
have legal sanctity and the public largely relies on the entries in the register to verify the title of a
particular person to a particular property. The Transfer of Property Act and the Registration Act are
complementary laws and the provisions of the former should not be allowed to be subverted by
resort to loopholes in the latter. If done, that would be a breakdown of the legal machinery, which
should be avoided at all costs, if people are to have faith in the legal system of the country, which
should be part of the public policy of India. If a vendor of a property is allowed to register a
cancellation deed after validly executing a sale deed, it will be chaos, and chaos only, in the realm of
real estate, driving, not only innocent purchasers, but also bona fide creditors who have accepted the
property as security for money advanced on the strength of the mortgage of the property, to too
expensive and time consuming litigation, which is against all norms of public policy.
15. In that regard there is another aspect of public policy as well. Sale is essentially an executed
contract, by which title to immovable property has been transferred to another, which is bilateral.
Such a contract cannot be unilaterally cancelled by one of the parties to the contract, unless such a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/397599/ 17Pavakkal Noble John vs Kerala State on 3 September, 2010
right has been reserved in the contract itself. There is no specific provision in the Transfer of
Property Act for cancellation of a sale. Section 4 of the Transfer of Property Act stipulates that the
provisions of the said Act which relate to contracts shall be taken as part of the Indian Contract Act.
Novation, recession and alteration of a contract are governed by Section 62 of the Indian Contract
Act. In City Bank V Standard Chartered Bank and others, (2004) 1 Supreme Court Cases 12, the
Supreme Court has held that "novation, recession or alteration of a contract under Section 62 of the
Contract Act can only be done with the agreement of both parties to the contract. Both the parties
have to agree to set aside the original contract with a new contract or for recession or alteration."
Therefore, a sale deed which is a contract between two parties for sale of a property, cannot be
unilaterally cancelled by one of the parties executing a cancellation deed, which if done would be
against Section 62 of the Indian Contract Act and therefore illegal. Therefore, once a sale deed is
validly executed, the same cannot be annulled, except by a decree of a court of law. By executing the
cancellation deed, the vendor is arrogating to himself, the power of the court to annul the sale deed
already executed by him. No person can be permitted to assume himself the powers exclusively
vested with the courts, which is what a vendor does, by cancelling a sale deed validly executed by
him. That would certainly be opposed to public policy. Therefore by registering a cancellation deed
of a sale deed, the sub-registrar is allowing the vendor to perpetrate an illegality against public
policy, which has to be prevented at any cost, if rule of law is to survive in this country. For this
reason also registration of cancellation deed of a sale deed is against public policy and therefore an
interpretation of the Registration Act and Rules, which would help to prevent such illegality, has to
be necessarily adopted by courts.
16. The view that cancellation of a sale deed can be only bi- lateral, is also clear from the newly
introduced Section 32A of the Registration Act, which reads thus:
"32A. Compulsory affixing of photograph, etc.-- Every person presenting any
document at the proper registration-office under Section 32 shall affix his passport
size photograph and fingerprints to the document:
Provided that where such document relates to the transfer of ownership of
immovable property, the passport size photograph and fingerprints of each buyer and
seller of such property mentioned in the document shall also be affixed to the
document."
If for transfer of ownership of immovable property photographs and fingerprints of each buyer and
seller of the property are mandatory, by the same coin, cancellation deed of a sale deed being
essentially a re-transfer of the immovable property back to the vendor should also necessarily
contain the photograph of both the parties to the sale deed, without which the cancellation deed
cannot be validly registered. Of course an argument is raised to the effect that the said Section is
applicable only when a person executes a sale deed for transfer of immovable property. But the
words used therein are `where such document relates to transfer of ownership of immovable
property', which is wide enough to include all documents relating to transfer of immovable property
and not confined to sale deeds for transferring immovable property. A cancellation deed cancelling a
sale deed is certainly a document relating to transfer of immovable property and would come
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/397599/ 18Pavakkal Noble John vs Kerala State on 3 September, 2010
squarely within the said proviso. Section 32A has been incorporated in the Registration Act to
prevent such misuse of the provisions of the Act and Rules. Non-compliance with Section 32A is
certainly a very valid reason for the sub-registrar to refuse registration of a cancellation deed
relating to transfer of immovable property, as is clear from clause VIIA of Rule 191. The sub-
registrar is therefore duty bound to insist upon the photograph and thumb impression of both
parties to be included in the cancellation deed as well, as mandated by the proviso to Section 32A of
the Registration Act for registration of a cancellation deed of a sale deed and if the cancellation deed
does not contain the photograph and thumb impression of both parties, he is statutorily bound to
refuse registration of that document. The thumb impression of a person cannot be obtained in a
document without his consent and his photograph cannot be validly affixed in a document without
his consent. Therefore a cancellation deed of a sale deed can be registered only with the consent of
both the original seller and the buyer and not unilaterally by the seller alone. For this reason also the
registration of a cancellation deed unilaterally cancelling a sale deed by the seller, without the
consent of the purchaser, is to be refused by the sub-registrar.
17. I am not unaware of the dangers of recognizing such a power in the sub-registrar in the present
day scenario in the State of Kerala. But in view of the fact that against a wrong refusal to register, an
aggrieved party has an easy remedy by way of appeal under Section 72 of the Registration Act is
sufficient safeguard against such abuse of power. In any event looking at the larger public policy
involved it is a small price to avoid a greater illegality.
18. As I have stated in the beginning, two High Courts have taken differing views on the same
question. Now, I shall refer to those decisions. There were differing views on this question by
different judges of the Andhra Pradesh High Court on this question. Therefore the matter was
referred to a Full Bench of the said High Court, who considered the matter in Yalana Malleswari's
case (supra). The Full Bench, by majority held the view that the registering officer cannot refuse to
register a cancellation deed cancelling a sale deed and relegated the parties to a civil suit. The third
learned judge of the Full Bench differed to hold that a person who has executed a sale deed and got
it registered cannot subsequently execute a document unilaterally cancelling the earlier sale deed
and that by registering the so called cancellation of sale deed the sub-registrar is, in effect, cancelling
the registration made earlier and once a registration is made, the sub-registrar has no power under
the Registration Act to cancel such a registration, as he became a functus officio. In G.D.
Subramaniam's case (supra), a learned single judge of the Madras High Court held that a registering
officer is legally obliged to refuse to register a deed of cancellation of sale unilaterally executed
without the knowledge and consent of the other parties to the sale deed and without complying with
Section 32A of the Registration Act and while holding so, chose to agree with the dissenting
judgment, refusing to follow the majority view, in Yalana Malleswari's case (supra). A division
Bench of the Madras High Court, in E.R. Kalaivan V Inspector General of Registration, Chennai and
another, AIR 2010 Madras 18 (DB) approved the view taken by the learned single judge of that High
Court in G.D. Subramaniam's case (supra). It is fruitful to know the reasons the Madras High Court
has given in G.D. Subramaniam's case (supra) to differ from the majority decision of the Andhra
Pradesh High Court in Yalana Malleswari's case (supra) and to agree with the minority view.
Paragraphs 20 to 23 contain the reasoning, which read thus:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/397599/ 19Pavakkal Noble John vs Kerala State on 3 September, 2010
"20. Now, turning to the judgment of the Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High
Court in Yanala Malleshwari and others, speaking for majority, His Lordship Justice
V.V.S.Rao, after having elaborately dealt with the identical questions, has ultimately
held in para 66 as follows:-
"Therefore, when the provisions of the Registration Act and Registration Rules
elaborately deal with the circumstances and situations when the registering officer
has to accept and register the documents and /or as to when registering officer has to
reject the documents for registration, it is not possible to hold as a general rule that
whenever a cancellation deed is submitted, the registering officer is bound to reject
the acceptance and registration of the same. Such interpretation would render
Section 126 of TP Act (which enables the donor of a gift to cancel/revoke the same)
ineffective. Second, there could be unimaginable number of circumstances when the
executant himself on his own volition comes before the registering officer and desires
to cancel the earlier document. As already pointed out supra, under Section 23-A of
the Registration Act, the registering officer can re-register a document totally
ignoring the earlier registration. Further more, under schedule 1-A to the Indian
Stamp Act as amended by the Stamp (A.P.Amendment) Act, 1922, cancellation deed
is one of the legal document recognized in law and a transaction for transfer of
immovable property is no exception."
21. With respect, I am unable to subscribe myself to the said view taken by the majority for the
reasons which follow. Though in para 54 of the judgment, a reference has been made to Section 32-
A of the Indian Registration Act, which was recently introduced, the learned Judge has not dealt
with the same elaborately. Nobody can have any quarrel over the legal position that a deed of
cancellation of a sale of immovable property of value Rs.100/- and upwards, is a document which
needs compulsory registration. But the learned Judge has taken the view that to revoke a sale or to
cancel the same, the consent or knowledge of the purchaser is not at all required. In my considered
opinion, as I have already stated, a sale being a bilateral contract, more particularly in view of
Section 32-A of the Indian Registration Act, if to be cancelled, it should be done bilaterally by both
the parties to the sale. The learned Judge has expressed the apprehension that if the law is so
interpreted so as to hold that the Registering officer has power to refuse to register a cacellation
deed, then, it would render Section 126 of the Transfer of Property Act, which enables the donor of a
gift to cancel it or revoke the same, ineffective. With respect, I am of the view, that such
apprehension has no basis. Section 126 of the Transfer of Property Act is a special provision dealing
with the power of the donor to revoke a gift deed in certain circumstances. Such kind of revocation
does not require the consent of the beneficiary of the gift. Basically, such a gift is not a contract in
terms of the definition of contact as found in the Indian Contract Act, since gift is a transfer made
voluntarily without consideration, whereas, a sale of an immovable property is a contract entered
into between two parties where consideration is a since-qua-non. Therefore, revocation of a gift
deed cannot be equated to cancellation of a sale deed. Both operate on different spheres. A reference
has also been made in the judgment to Section 23-A of the Registration Act. In my considered
opinion, Section 23-A which speaks of re-registration of certain documents has nothing to do with
cancellation of a validly executed document. It is not to say that invariably in all cases, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/397599/ 20Pavakkal Noble John vs Kerala State on 3 September, 2010
registering officer should refuse to register a cancellation deed. We cannot generalise all deeds of
cancellation as illegal or void so as to say that such documents cannot be registered at all. All I
would say is that such cancellation deeds which are executed bilaterally by both the parties to the
earlier document can be registered by the registering officer, provided, the other requirements of the
Indian Registration Act are satisfied. But those cancellation deeds executed unilaterally by one party
to the earlier transaction, without the consent of the other party and without complying with the
requirements of Section 32-A of the Indian Registration Act, alone are to be rejected by the
Registering Officer.
22. In the minority judgment of His Lordship Justice Bilal Nazki, in para 120, the learned Judge has
held as follows:-
"Lastly, it was contended by the respondents that under no provision of law the
Sub-Registrar is required to register a document after an enquiry as to the ownership
of the property with respect to which a document is sought to be registered. It may be
true that there is no such provision in the Registration Act, but if strictly interpreted,
then the Registration Act would not empower the registering authority to register any
document unless it falls within Section 17 or 18 of the Registration Act. Section 17
mentions those documents which are compulsorily registrable and Section 18
mentions those documents, of which, the registration is optional, but, the whole
scheme of the Registration Act shows that it is incumbent upon the Registrar not to
register documents that are unlawful. Obviously if a person has no right in the
property and his interests in the property had extinguished, if he tries to execute any
document for the same property, the document would be illegal........................"
"...........It is only on mere reading of the document that Sub-Registrar would come to
a conclusion that the document, which was sought to be registered, was an illegal
document and as such could not be registered. Therefore, the argument of the
learned counsel for respondents that the Sub- Registrar has no authority to make
enquiries with regard to the title of the parties who executes the documents, would
have to be accepted with exceptions. That document has no title over the property,
the Sub-Registrar is not bound to register such a document. The Scheme of the
Registration Act shows that documents which create interest or extinguish interest
are either compulsorily registrable or are to be registered at the option of the
executor. Besides this, what is sought to be revoked by this cancellation deed, is the
earlier registered sale deed."
(Emphasis supplied)
23. In Badugu Venkata Durga Rao v. Surneni Lakshmi reported in 2001(1) ALD 86, a learned Single
Judge of the Andhra Pradesh High Court has also taken the view that a person who has executed a
sale deed and got it registered cannot subsequently execute a document unilaterally cancelling the
earlier sale deed. This view has been accepted by His Lordship Bilal Nazki in the minority
judgment". I respectfully agree with the reasoning given by the learned single judge of the Madras
High Court as quoted above as also the dissenting judgment in Yalana Malleswari's case (Supra) and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/397599/ 21Pavakkal Noble John vs Kerala State on 3 September, 2010
disagree with those in the majority decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Yalana
Malleswari's case (supra).
19. It is useful to note what happened in Andhra Pradesh after Yalana Malleswari's case (supra),
which is also noted in paragraph 26 of G.D. Subramaniam's case (supra) as follows:
"26. After the Full Bench judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Yanala
Malleshwari and others v. Ananthula Sayamma and others case, the Andhra Pradesh
Government introduced Rule 26(k) of the Andhra Pradesh Registration Rules by
means of an amendment dated 29.11.2006, which reads as follows: (i) The
Registering Officer shall ensure at the time of presentation for registration of
cancellation deeds of previously registered deed of conveyance on sale before him
that such cancellation deeds are executed by all executant and claimant parties to the
previously registered conveyance on sale and that such cancellation deed is
accompanied by a declaration showing mutual consent or orders of a competent Civil
or High Court of State or Central Government annulling the transaction contained
the previously registered deed of conveyance on sale; provided that the registering
officer shall dispense with the execution of cancellation deeds by executant and
claimant parties to the previously registered deeds of conveyances on sale before him
if the cancellation deed is executed by a Civil Judge or a Government Officer
competent to execute Government orders declaring the properties contained in the
previously registered conveyance on sale to be Government or Assigned or
Endowment lands or properties not registrable by any provision of law. (ii) Save in
the manner provided for above,no cancellation deed of a previously registered deed
of conveyance on sale before him shall be accepted for presentation for registration.
The said rule 26(k) was challenged before the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Kaitha
Narasimha v. The State Government of A.P., rep. by its Principal Secretary,
(W.P.No.3744/2007) by contending that the same is ultra vires of the provisions of
the Registration Act, 1908 and is contrary to the judgment of the Full Bench in
Yanala Malleshwari and others v. Ananthula Sayamma and others. The Division
Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, by order dated 13.3.2007, while upholding
the said Rule has held as follows;- "In our opinion, the impugned rule does not in any
manner violate the ratio of the majority judgment of the Full Bench. Rather, as
mentioned above, it is a statutory embodiment of one of the rules of natural justice
and is intended to curtail unnecessary litigation emanating from the ex parte
registration of cancellation deeds." As indicted in the above judgment, the principles
of natural justice are also to be adhered to by the Registering officer while dealing
with a deed of cancellation of sale. If a unilateral cancellation deed is allowed to be
registered, without the knowledge and consent of the other party to the earlier
contract, as held by the Division Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court, such
registration would cause violence to the principles of natural justice and lead to
unnecessary litigations emanating therefrom."

20. The fact that the State of Rajasthan also experiences similar difficulties is clear from the decision
of the Supreme Court in Basant Nahata's case (supra). That State attempted a solution for this
difficult situation by introducing Section 22A in the Registration Act, which read as follows:
"22A- Documents registration of which is opposed to public policy -
(1) The State Government may by notification in the Official gazette, declare that the
registration of any document or class of document is opposed to public policy.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, the registering officer shall
refuse to register any document to which a notification issued under sub-section (1) is
applicable.
That section was declared as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of India in Basant Nahata's case
(supra) on the ground that the word `public policy' has not been properly explained in the Act and
the provisions do not lay down any guidelines to make it constitutional. The State of Tamilnadu also
followed suit, which was also struck down as unconstitutional by a Division Bench of the Madras
High Court in W.P. Nos. 757 & 758 of 2007, following the Supreme Court judgment in Basant
Nahata's case (supra), which has also been taken note of in paragraph 30 of G.D. Subramaniam's
case (supra). In G.D. Subramaniam's case (supra) the learned judge suggested to the State of
Tamilnadu as follows:
"After the above developments, the State of Tamil Nadu, obviously, has not
considered the situation prevailing in the State necessitating introduction of an
appropriate provision in the Act or in the Rules itself so as to prevent registration of
documents which are opposed to public policy. As we have noticed, the Andhra
Pradesh Government has duly introduced Rule 26(k) of the Andhra Pradesh
Registration Rules making it mandatory for the Registering Officer, not to register a
deed of cancellation of a sale deed, if it is not executed mutually by the parties to the
earlier sale deed. If it is the intention of the Government of Tamil Nadu not to allow
registration of certain kinds of deeds such as deeds of cancellation of sale, executed
unilaterally, even now, it is left open to the Government of Tamil Nadu to bring an
appropriate amendment to the Registration Act or to the Rules as has been done in
Andhra Pradesh in tune with the law declared by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in State
of Rajasthan v. Basanth Nahata by making it mandatory for the Registering officers
to refuse to register certain documents which are opposed to public policy by
succinctly defining the documents in the statute itself without delegating the power to
define the same to the Executive. This court is hopeful, that the Government will take
serious note of the situation prevailing in the State and fall in line with Andhra
Pradesh Rules."

21. I may also refer to a decision of a learned single judge of this court namely, Sulabha V Suseela,
ILR 2009 (1) Kerala 165, which was brought to my notice by the learned amicus curiae. That was a
case where the direction issued by the Upa Lok Ayukta to the Inspector General of Registration to
issue appropriate clarifications to all his subordinate officials to desist from registering documents
which may have any legal validity or enforceability was under
challenge seeking a direction to the sub-registrar to declare that the petitioner and
her husband are entitled to get the document, executed by them registered under the
Registration Act. Of course the learned single judge held that the registering officer is
not competent to say that a document which has no enforceability or legal validity
need not be allowed to be registered. The decision related to a divorce agreement
executed by a husband and wife,, registration of which does not affect public policy,
and the decision has not examined the question in the perspective in which it has
been considered in this decision, but has been rendered wholly on the basis of Rules
67 and 191 of the Registration Rules (Kerala), assuming that the sub-
registrar has powers to refuse registration only for the reasons enumerated in Rule 191, without
noticing the words "the refusal would usually come under" occurring in Rule 191. Since that decision
relates to registration of a divorce agreement between a husband and wife which has no public
policy angle, and the same has not examined the question in the perspective in which I have dealt
with it in the light of similar experiences in two other states, that decision must be taken to be an
authority for what it actually decided, which is that divorce agreements, even though may not be
enforceable in law, cannot be refused to be registered. Regarding the other point, the said judgment
can be held to be rendered per incurium since the same is contrary to the legal principles involved as
elucidated above and the learned judge was ill-informed about the other legal provisions relevant to
decide the issue.
22. The conclusions emerging from the above discussion may be summed up as follows:
(i) The sub-registrar is legally obliged to reject and refuse to register a deed of
cancellation of a sale unilaterally executed without the knowledge and consent of the
other parties to the sale deed and without complying with Section 32A of the
Registration Act, 1908.
(ii) All sub-registrars of the State shall see that a deed of cancellation of sale is
registered only if executed with mutual consent of all parties to the sale, complying
with the provisions of the Act and Rules including Section 32A of the Registration
Act.
23. In the result, these two writ petitions are allowed and the registration of the deed of cancellation
dated 1-8-2009 registered as document no. 2830/2009 of Uliyil Sub Registrar's Office produced as
Ext. P3 in W.P. (C) No. 34367/2009 and the registration of the deed of cancellation dated
24-11-2009 registered as document no. 2099/2009 of Anchalummood Sub Registrar's Office
produced as Ext. P2 in W.P. (C) No. 37150/2009 are hereby quashed. The respective sub-registrar
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/397599/ 24Pavakkal Noble John vs Kerala State on 3 September, 2010
shall cancel, strike off and remove the said deeds from the registers maintained by them in respect
of the respective properties and the same shall not be included in the encumbrance certificates to be
issued in respect of those properties. For completing the formalities, the 4th respondent in W.P. (C)
No. 34367/2009 and the 3rd respondent in W.P. (C) No. 37150/2009 shall produce the cancellation
deeds executed by them before the respective sub-registrar for cancelling the registration within two
weeks from receipt of a communication from the sub-registrar directing production, which the
sub-registrar shall issue within two weeks. However, the sub registrar shall not wait for such
production for making appropriate changes in his register as directed above.
Before parting with the case, I suggest that the Government of Kerala would do well to introduce
appropriate amendment to either the Act or the Rules, in line with Rule 26(k) of the Andhra Pradesh
Registration Rules referred to above, (see paragraph 19 supra) to give a statutory framework to the
findings in this judgment. To enable the Government to consider the same, the Registry shall
forward a copy of this judgment to the Secretary, Registration Department and the Inspector
General of Registration, of the Government of Kerala. I sincerely hope that my above suggestion will
not meet with the same fate, namely, discard to the waste bin, as my suggestion in Retnavally V
Ambalapadu S.C.B. Ltd., 2005 (3) KLT 320, wherein also a suggestion was made to the Government
in respect of notification of commencement of Section 4A of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, in
the State of Kerala, which would have hugely benefitted the entire workforce in Kerala covered by
the Payment of Gratuity Act, without any corresponding financial burden on either the employers or
the Government. In the meanwhile, the Inspector General of registration shall circulate a copy of
this judgment with appropriate directions in accordance with this judgment, to all sub- registrars of
the State who shall implement the directions contained herein.
It would be gross ingratitude on my part, unless I place on record my appreciation for the able
assistance rendered by the amicus curiae, Advocate Sri. T.R. Ravi, to the court, in these two writ
petitions. He responded to the request of the court seeking his assistance, readily, without
reservation and gave his best in finding out and placing before the court precedents and arguments
for and against, to enable me to arrive at a just conclusion. I am certain that without his assistance,
this judgment would not have been in this form and would have been far from satisfactory. I place
on record the appreciation of this court for his unselfish efforts in that regard. But I hasten to add
that this is not intended to belittle the contribution of the advocates appearing in these two writ
petitions, who also assisted me to the best of their ability.
Sd/- S. Siri Jagan, Judge.
