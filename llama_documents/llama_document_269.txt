Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1455654/ 1Mookammal vs Subramanian on 19 November, 2009
The plaintiff is the appellant in the suit and the appeal is preferred against the judgment and decree
dated 29.08.1997, in A.S.No.21 of 1995, on the file of the learned Principle District Judge, Tuticorin,
confirming the judgment and decree dated 02.03.1994 in O.S.No.289 of 1989 on the file of the
District Munsif Court, Srivaikundam.
2.The suit is filed for partition and for mesne profits. According to the plaintiff,the first schedule of
the suit property belonged to one Marimuthu Thevar, the father of the plaintiff, who was doing
brokerage and the income was not sufficient. The husband of the plaintiff assisted the said
Marimuthu Thevar and with their joint efforts, the second schedule property was purchased in the
name of Mrimuthu Thevar and in the 4th item, Marimuthu Thevar constructed two houses. The
third schedule property belonged to the mother of the plaintiff, namely, Petchiammal and she died
in the year 1957. Marimuthu Thevar had executed a registered 'will' dated 20.04.1970 bequeathing
the properties to others against the interest of the plaintiff. He revoked the will and on such
revocation, Marimuthu Thevar insisted the plaintiff to execute a release deed in his favour. The said
release deed is not valid as it was executed under coercion and undue influence. Marimuthu Thevar
died in the year 1988 leaving behind the plaintiff and the defendants 1 to 5 as his legal heirs.
Therefore, the plaintiff is entitled for half share in the first schedule and 1/6th share in the second
and third schedule properties. The other defendants are subsequent transferees.
3.The suit was resisted by the defendants 1 to 5 stating that the plaintiff has relinquished her right
under release deed dated 06.01.1971 which is for a valuable consideration and therefore, she is not
entitled for any share. The trial Court on analysing the oral and documentary evidence found that
the release deed is true and valid and negatived the contention of the plaintiff that it was created
under coercion and undue influence and also negatived the plea of the plaintiff that the release deed
was hit by the Section 6 of Transfer Property Act and thus dismissed the suit. The first appellate
Court also agreed with the trail Court and dismissed the appeal. Aggrieved by the same, the plaintiff
has preferred the present appeal on the following grounds:
"1.The courts below erred in law in its interpretation of Section 6 of the Transfer of
Property Act.
2.The courts below overlooked that any transfer covered by Section 6 of the Transfer
of Property Act is contrary to law and as such a transfer cannot be validated on the
ground of estopped under Section 115 of the Evidence Act, on the Principle that there
cannot be any estoppel against statutes.
3.The courts below overlooked, indisputably on the date of Ex.A.4, that the release
and the appellant, the releasor, knew the fact that the appellant is not entitled to a
share and that she is only a heir apparent and as such there is no question of estoppel
arises".
4.On admission of the second appeal, the following substantial question of law is formulated:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1455654/ 2Mookammal vs Subramanian on 19 November, 2009
"Whether the courts below is right in holding that Ex.A.4 is valid and binding on the
appellant especially when the said Ex.A.4 is hit by Section 6 of the Transfer of
Property Act?
5.Heard Mr.K.Srinivasan, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant/plaintiff and
Mr.K.Govindarajan, learned counsel appearing for the respondents /defendants.
6.It is admitted that the suit property originally belonged to one Marimuthu Thevar and his wife
Petchiammal. It is also admitted that on 06.01.1971, there were certain documents came to be
executed by Marimuthu Thevar and the plaintiff. Marimuthu Thevar executed a deed of transfer in
favour of plaintiff's husband Shunmuga Thevar under Ex.A.1. Under Ex.A.5, Marimuthu Devar
seems to have revoked the earlier 'will' Ex.A.3. The plaintiff has executed a gift deed in favour of said
Marimuthu Thevar. Under Ex.A.4 and she had also executed the release deed relinquishing her
rights in the properties of her father which she may inherit.
7.The learned counsel appearing for the appellant would submit that the release deed dated
06.01.1971 is not valid as it was executed under coercion and undue influence. He also pointed out
that there was an earlier will executed by Marimuthu Thevar under Ex.A.2 and only to cancel the
said 'will', the plaintiff was compelled to execute the release deed. The learned counsel also pointed
out that the plaintiff is a sharer who would be succeeding to the estate of Marimuthu Thevar and the
release deed is not valid under Section 6(a) of the transfer of property Act, 1982.
8.The learned counsel relied upon the judgment in Rengaswami Bali vs. Maruthayee Ammal and
another reported in 2007(4) TLNJ 44 (Civil), wherein this Court has held that, "12.At this juncture,
the Court must look into Section 6(a) of the Transfer of Property Act, wherein it reads as follows:
'The chance of an heir-apparent succeeding to an estate, the chance of a relation
obtaining a legacy on the death of a Kinsman, or any other mere possibility of a like
nature, cannot be transferred'.
13.In the instant case, after the death of Panchalai Ammal, her husband viz., Palaniandi Naicker has
succeeded her estate. The right of Palaniandi Naicker is nothing but Spes Successions or hope of
Successions. As per Section 6(a) of the Transfer of Property Act, the same cannot be transferred.
Therefore, on the basis of Section 6(a) of the Transfer of Property Act, it is needless to say that
Ex.B.3 is a void document. Since Ex.B.3 is a void document, the defendant has no manner of right,
title and interest over the suit A schedule property".
9.He also relied upon another judgment in Gulam Abbas vs. Haji Kayyam Ali and ohters reported in
AIR 1973 SUPREME COURT 554 (V 60 C 114), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that, "This is a
correct statement, so far as it goes, of the law, because a bare renunciation of an expectation to
inherit cannot bind the expectant heir's conduct in future. But, if the expectant heir goes further and
receives consideration and so conducts himself as to mislead an owner into not making dispositions
of his property inter vivos the expectant heir could be debarred from setting up his right when it
does unquestionably vest in him. In other words, the principle of estoppal remains untouched by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1455654/ 3Mookammal vs Subramanian on 19 November, 2009
this statement".
10.The learned counsel also relied upon the judgment in Mohd.Noor and others vs. Mohd.Ibrahim
and others reported in (1994) 5 SUPREME COURT 562 for the proposition as to the right of
ownership.
11.On the contrary, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent would submit that release of
right by one of heir apparent for a consideration is not opposed to law and the same has been upheld
by the Supreme Court in Jumma Masjid vs. Kodimaniandra Deviah and others reported in AIR 1962
SUPREME COURT 847(V 49 C 119), wherein it was held, "Where a person transfers property
representing that he has a present interest therein, whereas he has, in fact, only a spes successionis,
the transferee is entitled to the benefit of S.43, if he has taken the transfer on the faith of that
representation and for consideration.
Such a construction of S.43 has not the effect of nullifying S.6(a). Section 6(a) and S.43 relate to two
different subjects, and there is no necessary conflict between them. Section 6(a) deals with certain
kinds of interests in property mentioned therein, and prohibits a transfer simpliciter of those
interests. Section 43 deals with representations as to title made by a transferor who had no title at
the time of transfer, and provides that the transfer shall fasten itself on the title which the transferor
subsequently acquires. Section 6(a) enacts a rule of substantive law, while S.43 enacts a rule of
estoppel which is one of evidence. The two provisions operate on different fields, and under
different conditions, and there is no ground for reading a conflict between them or for cutting down
the ambit of the one by reference to the other; both of them can be given full effect on their own
terms, in their respective spheres. To hold that transfers by persons who have only a spes
successionis at the date of transfer are not within the protection afforded by S.43 would destroy its
utility to a large extent".
12.The simple point arises for consideration is, whether the release deed dated 06.01.1971 under
Ex.A.4 equivalent to Ex.B.3 is hit by Section 6(a) of the Transfer of Property Act and relinquishment
of future succession is valid ?
13.Section 6(a) of the Transfer of Property Act reads as follows:
"The chance of an heir-apparent succeeding to an estate, the chance of a relation
obtaining a legacy on the death of a Kinsman, or any other mere possibility of a like
nature, cannot be transferred."
14.It is a settled proposition that "Spes successionis" or hope of successions is not transferable under
Section 6(a) of the Transfer of Property Act. According to the appellant relinquishment of her right
under the release deed is "Spes successionis"
15.The judgment relied on by the learned counsel appearing for the appellant reported in 2007(4)
TNLJ 44(Civil), is a case relating to a transfer effected by a person who subsequently obtained such
interest in the property transferred. The question before the single Judge was whether section 43of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1455654/ 4Mookammal vs Subramanian on 19 November, 2009
the Transfer of Property Act (here in after referred as Act) is applicable or not and the learned Judge
also relied on section 6 of the Act and held that the chance of a heir apparent succeeding to a estate
cannot transfer the title to the transferee. The right transferred was only spes successionis or hope of
succession.
16.In the present case, the heir apparent has relinquished her future interest in the property for a
consideration. In a similar situation, the Supreme Court in AIR 1973 SCC 544 (cited supra), has
discussed in detail about section 6(a) and Section 43 of the Transfer of Property Act.
17.Section 43 of the Transfer of Property Act reads as follows:
43.Transfer by unauthorised person who subsequently acquires interest in property
transferred.- Where a person [fraudulently or] erroneously represents that he is
authorised to transfer certain immovable property and professes to transfer such
property for consideration, such transfer shall, at the option of the transferee, operate
on any interest which the transferor may acquire in such property at any time during
which the contract of transfer subsists.
Nothing in this section shall impair the right of transferees in good faith for consideration without
notice of the existence of the said option".
18.It is also necessary to refer section 115 of the Indian Evidence Act Section 115 of the Evidence Act
reads as follows:
115.Estoppel.- When one person has, by his/her declaration, act or omission,
intentionally caused or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to
act upon such belief, neither he nor his representative shall be allowed, in any suit or
proceeding between himself and such person or his representative, to deny the truth
of that thing.
19.Admittedly in the present case, three transactions took place on 06.01.1971, (I) Marimuthu
Thevar revoked the 'will' dated 20.04.1970, (ii) the plaintiff executed a gift deed and (iii) Marimuthu
Thevar executed a gift deed in favour of the plaintiff's husband . The plaintiff has executed the
release deed under Ex.A.4 in favour of Marimuthu Thevar relinquishing her right. Therefore, the
entire transaction, taken as a whole, would show that it is a family arrangement between the parties.
The relinquishment is for a proper consideration.
20.The fair and equitable family arrangement is finally binding on the parties to the same. Though,
the transfer of the chance of heir apparent succeeding to estate is prohibited under Section 6(a) of
Transfer of Property Act. There is nothing to prevent for relinquishing a claim to inheritance for a
realisation of a consideration in order to avoid future disputes. In that event, once the heir apparent
relinquished the possibility of her right of inheritance for a consideration, the same is not covered
under Section 6(a) of the Transfer of Property Act, but, the principle of estoppel under Section 115 of
the Evidence Act would apply.

21.In Gulam Abbas vs. Haji Kayyam Ali and ohters reported in AIR 1973 SUPREME COURT 554 (V
60 C 114), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that, "This is a correct statement, so far as it goes, of
the law, because a bare renunciation of an expectation to inherit cannot bind the expectant heir's
conduct in future. But, if the expectant heir goes further and receives consideration and so conducts
himself as to mislead an owner into not making dispositions of his property inter vivos the expectant
heir could be debarred from setting up his right when it does unquestionably vest in him. In other
words, the principle of estoppal remains untouched by this statement".
22.In my considered opinion, the courts below have rightly found that the plaintiff is estopped from
claiming any right of the properties of the Marimuthu Thevar and therefore, has rightly negatived
her claim. I have no reason to interfere with the findings of the courts below. The questions of law
are answered accordingly, In the result the Second Appeal is dismissed. No costs.
