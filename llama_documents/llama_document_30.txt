1. This order shall dispose of a bunch of 85 appeals bearing ITA Nos. 200, 201, 232 to 255, 271 to
273, 283 to 298, 303 to 308, 310 to 316, 332 to 334, 356 to 358 and 361 of 2013, 10 to 16, 25, 26, 73,
74, 90, 110, 136, 191, 192, 253, 254, 278 and 398 of 2014, as learned counsel for the parties are
agreed that common substantial questions of law are involved therein in all these appeals. However,
the facts are being extracted from ITA No.200 of 2013.
2. ITA No.200 of 2013 has been preferred by the appellant- assessee under Section 260A of the
Income Tax Act, 1961 (in short, "the Act") against the order dated 29.7.2013 passed under Section
254(1) of the Act by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Chandigarh 'B' Bench, Chandigarh (in short,
"the Tribunal') in ITA No.448/Chd/2011 for the assessment year 2007-08. On 30.5.2014, these
appeals were admitted which raise the following substantial questions of law:-
i) "Whether the transactions in hand envisage a "transfer"
exigible to tax by reference to Section 2(47)(v) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 read with Section 53-A of
the Transfer of Property Act, 1882?
ii) Whether the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, has ignored rights emanating from the JDA, legal
effect of non registration of JDA, its alleged repudiation etc.?
iii) Whether "possession" as envisaged by Section 2(47)(v) and Section 53-A of the Transfer of
Property Act, 1882 was delivered, and if so, its nature and legal effect?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 2C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
iv) Whether there was any default on the part of the developers, and if so, its effect on the
transactions and on exigibility to tax?
v) Whether amount yet to be received can be taxed on an hypothetical assumption arising from the
amount to be received?"
3. A few facts relevant for the decision of the controversy involved as narrated in ITA No.200 of
2013 may be noticed. The appellant- assessee is an individual and one of the members of the
Punjabi Cooperative Housing Building Society Limited (hereinafter referred to as "the Society"). The
Society consisting of 95 members is owner of 21.2 acres of land in Village Kansal. It had allotted
plots measuring 500 square yards to its 65 members, 1000 square yards to its 30 members and four
plots of 500 square yards each were retained by it. It entered into a tripartite Joint Development
Agreement dated 25.2.2007 (in short, "JDA") with Hash Builders Private Limited, Chandigarh (for
brevity "HASH") and Tata Housing Development Company Limited, Mumbai (THDC). Under the
JDA, it was agreed that HASH and THDC ("the developers') shall undertake development of 21.2
acres of land owned and registered in the name of the society in respect of which it would give
development rights in lieu of consideration. The agreed consideration was to be disbursed by THDC
through Hash to each individual member of the society having plot size of 500 square yards partly in
monetary terms (` 82.50 lacs in cash) and balance in terms of built up GURBAX SINGHproperty
(one flat measuring 2250 square feet). Clause 4 of the JDA provided the following schedule:-
a) Payment of ` 3 lacs per plot holder of 500 square yards and ` 6 lacs per plot holder
of 1000 square yards upon execution of the JDA as adjustable advance.
b) Payment of ` 12 lacs per plot holder of 500 square yards and `24 lacs per plot holder of 1000
square yards to be made upon execution of the JDA against execution of a registered sale deed by
the society in favour of THDC for land of equivalent value being 3.08 acres having specific Khasra
nos. as mentioned in the JDA.
c) Payment of ` 18 lacs per plot holder of 500 square yards and ` 36 lacs per plot holder of 1000
square yards to be made within two months of execution of the JDA against execution of another
registered sale deed by the society in favour of THDC for land of equivalent value being 4.62 acres.
d) Payment of ` 24.75 lacs per plot holder of 500 square yards and ` 49.50 lacs per plot holder of
1000 square yards to be made within six months from the date of execution of the JDA or within two
months from the date of the approval of the plans/design and drawings and grant of final licence to
develop whereupon construction can commence, whichever was later, against execution of another
registered sale deed by the society in favour of THDC for land of equivalent value being 6.36 acres.
e) Balance payment of ` 24.75 lacs per plot holder of 500 square yards and ` 49.50 lacs per plot
holder of 1000 square yards to be made within two months from the date of payment as per clause
(d) above, towards full and final settlement of payments after adjustment of the advance/earnest
money against execution of another registered sale deed by the society in favour of THDC for land of
equivalent value being 7.14 acres.

f) Each member having plot of 500 square yards was entitled to receive one built up apartment
having super area of 2250 square feet and each member having plot of 1000 square yards was
entitled to two built up apartments having super area of 2250 square feet after transfer of land in the
name of THDC. Allotment letters were to be issued by THDC within two months from the date of
obtaining approval to commence construction at the site. Copies of the minutes of the Executive
Committee of the society dated 4.1.2007 and JDA dated 25.2.2007 are attached as Annexures A.1
and A.2 respectively with the appeal. Clause 14 of the agreement further provided that in case of
termination of the JDA, lands registered in the name of THDC upto the date of termination shall
remain with THDC and the balance lands to be transferred shall not be transferred in favour of
THDC.
4. The developers made payments only upto clause (c) above i.e. upto second installment and till
date only part of the land measuring 7.7 acres i.e. 3.08 acres plus 4.62 acres having specific khasra
nos. as mentioned in the JDA and plan attached thereto have actually been registered in the name of
THDC. Copy of the sale deed dated 2.3.2007 is attached as Annexure A.3 with the appeal.
Subsequently, substantial disputes arose between the society on the one hand and the developers on
the other with regard to further payments to be made in terms of the JDA i.e. from clause (d)
onwards. The appellant, who had been allotted 1000 square yards of plot in the society was, as per
the JDA, entitled to receive monetary consideration of ` 1,65,00,000/- and two furnished flats of
2250 square feet each. The appellant actually received proportionate amount of ` 66 lacs of which `
30 lacs was received during the year under consideration and the balance amount of ` 36 lacs was
received in the subsequent year relevant to GURBAX SINGHthe assessment year 2008-09.
5. For the previous year relevant to the assessment year 2007-08, the appellant filed original return
of income on 7.12.2007 declaring income of ` 2,50,171/-. In the original return, the appellant did not
offer to tax any amount under the JDA on the ground that there was no transfer to THDC during the
year under consideration and also because ownership as well as possession of the land still vested in
the society. The return of income for the relevant assessment year 2007-08 was later revised by the
appellant on 7.10.2009 declaring income of ` 30,08,606/- which included capital gains of `
27,58,436/-. In the said return, the appellant offered to tax ` 30 lacs under the head 'capital gains'
received by him during the year under consideration qua that portion of land in respect of which
sale deed was registered in favour of the developers. The Assessing Officer, however, treated the
revised return filed by the appellant as non est. Copies of the return of income originally filed and
revised return for the assessment year 2007-08 are attached as Annexures 4 (colly) with the appeal.
According to the appellant, ` 36 lacs received in the subsequent year relevant to the assessment year
2008-09 were also offered for tax in the year under the head 'capital gains' (Annexure A.5).
6. The Assessing Officer vide order dated 30.12.2009, Annexure A.6 passed under Section 143(3) of
the Act held that since as per the JDA, there was grant and assignment of various rights in the
property by the appellant in favour of THDC alongwith handing over physical and vacant
possession, the same tantamount to "transfer". The Assessing Officer applied the provisions of
Section 2(47)(v) of the Act read with Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (in short, "the
1882 Act") which provides that any transaction involving allowing the possession of any immovable
property to be taken or retained in part performance of contract of the nature referred to in Section
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 4C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
53A of the 1882 Act shall be treated as "transfer" for purposes of the Act. Since the JDA was signed
on 25.2.2007 i.e. during the previous year relevant to assessment year 2007-08, the Assessing
Officer computed chargeable capital gains in that year. It was also held that there was 'transfer'
within the meaning of sub sections (ii) and (vi) of Section 2(47) of the Act. The Assessing Officer
held that the following consideration receivable by the members of the society having plot size of
500 square yards under the JDA was to be taxable under the head 'capital gains' in the assessment
year 2007-08 since JDA was signed in the said year:
a) monetary consideration receivable at ` 82.50 lacs (though only ` 15 lacs received
during the relevant year) and;
b) fair market value of 2250 square feet flat (to be received in future) at the rate of `
4500 per square feet = ` 1,01,25,000/-.
The Assessing Officer accordingly held that the appellant was liable to tax during the assessment
year under consideration on the entire amount receivable in future under the head 'capital gains'
and thus made net addition of ` 3,54,68,276/- on account of long term capital gains taxable in the
hands of the appellant in terms of the JDA as under:-
Monetary consideration (` 82.50 lacs x2) ` 1,65,00,000 Two flats of 2250 square feet
each ` 2,02,50,000 valued at the rate of ` 4500 square feet.
Total consideration ` 3,67,50,000
Less Indexed cost of acquisition ` 12,81,724
Net addition ` 3,54,68,276
7. Aggrieved by the order, the appellant filed appeal before the GURBAX
SINGHCommissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) [CIT(A)]. Vide order dated 23.2.2011,
Annexure A.7, the CIT(A) dismissed the appeal upholding the order passed by the
Assessing Officer. The appellant filed appeal before the Tribunal. The appellant also
produced following additional evidence under Rule 29 of the Income Tax (Appellate
Tribunal) Rules, 1963 (in short, "the Rules") :-
i) THDC failed to strictly comply with the payment schedule in as much as it did not
make payment of the installments mentioned in clauses (d) to (f) above;
ii) THDC further failed to discharge their part of obligation by failing to obtain
various sanctions like site plan/drawings/designs etc. from appropriate authorities in
order to commence and carry out development as stipulated under the agreement;
iii) Order dated 20.1.2011 passed by this Court staying the execution of the project
under the JDA;
iv) Refusal by THDC vide letter dated 4.2.2011 to make payment of third installment.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 5C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
v) Resolution dated 13.6.2011 passed by the society terminating the JDA and
revocation of power of attorney on 31.10.2011, Annexure A.8 (Colly).
It was further pointed out by the appellant that in the case of Shri Satpal Gosain, one of the
co-members of the society, the CIT(A) in his appeal for the assessment year 2007-08 had admitted
the aforesaid evidence and after considering the same deleted the addition made by the Assessing
Officer on similar grounds. The Tribunal admitted the additional evidence. Vide order dated
29.7.2013, Annexure A.9-A impugned herein upheld the order passed by the Assessing officer
bringing to tax the entire consideration receivable under the JDA as liable for tax under the head
'capital gains'. The Tribunal held that the provisions of section 2(47)(v) of the Act read with section
53A of the 1882 Act were applicable for the following reasons:-
a) possession and original title deeds of the land were actually handed over by the
society to the developers;
b) irrevocable power of attorney granting substantial rights to the developers was
executed on 26.2.2007 which having been registered, it was not necessary to register
the JDA;
c) through various clauses of the JDA and irrevocable power of attorney, the
developer was in complete control of the property and was in possession thereof as
contemplated in the aforesaid section;
d) there was no force in the contention of the assessee that possession was given only
as permissive licensee under section 52 of the Indian Easement Act, 1882 since in the
present case, all possible rights in the property including right to sell etc. had been
given to the builder;
e) requirement of registration of agreement under section 53A of the TPA cannot be read into
section 2(47)(v) of the Act since the said section only refers to the contract of the nature referred to
in section 53A of the TPA without going into controversy whether such agreement is registered or
not.
In nut shell, the Tribunal held that technically there was transfer in terms of Section 2(47)(v) of the
Act read with Section 53A of the 1882 Act. The entire consideration receivable under the JDA was
thus held to be taxable in the hands of the appellant. The Tribunal also affirmed the determination
of notional value of flat by applying rate of ` 4500 per square feet. The issue of allowability of
exemption under section 54F of the Act was however not considered as the grounds raised before
the Tribunal referred to sections 54 and 54EC and not to section 54F of the Act. Hence the instant
appeal by the assessee- appellant.
8. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
9. The following issues emerge for consideration and adjudication:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 6C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
(i) scope and legislative intent of Section 2(47)(ii), (v) and (vi) of the Act;
(ii) the essential ingredients for applicability of Section 53A of 1882 Act;
(iii) meaning to be assigned to the term "possession"?
(iv) whether in the facts and circumstances, any taxable capital gains arises from the
transaction entered by the assessee?
10. Taking up first issue, it may be noticed that Section 2(14) of the Act defines "capital asset"
whereas Section 45 of the Act is the charging section in regard to capital gains. Section 48 of the Act
provides for mode of computation of capital gains. Before delving into the controversy involved in
the present case, it would be advantageous to refer to the relevant portion of Section 2(47) of the Act
defining 'transfer', which reads thus:-
Section 2(47) of Income Tax Act, 1961 - Definition of Transfer In this Act, unless the
context otherwise requires-
"transfer", in relation to a capital asset, includes,--
(i) xx xx xx xx xx xx x
(ii) the extinguishment of any rights therein ; or
(iii), (iv) & (iva) x xx xx xx xx xx
(v) any transaction involving the allowing of the possession of any immovable
property to be taken or retained in part performance of a contract of the nature
referred to in section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of 1882) ; or
(vi) any transaction (whether by way of becoming a member of, or acquiring shares
in, a co-operative society, company or other association of persons or by way of any
agreement or any GURBAX SINGH arrangement or in any other manner whatsoever)
which has the effect of transferring, or enabling the enjoyment of, any immovable
property.
Explanation 1.--For the purposes of sub-clauses (v) and (vi), "immovable property" shall have the
same meaning as in clause
(d) of section 269UA.
Explanation 2.--For the removal of doubts, it is hereby clarified that "transfer" includes and shall be
deemed to have always included disposing of or parting with an asset or any interest therein, or
creating any interest in any asset in any manner whatsoever, directly or indirectly, absolutely or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 7C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
conditionally, voluntarily or involuntarily, by way of an agreement (whether entered into in India or
outside India) or otherwise, notwithstanding that such transfer of rights has been characterized as
being effected or dependent upon or flowing from the transfer of a share or shares of a company
registered or incorporated outside India."
Clause (d) of Section 269UA of the Act which defines 'immovable property"
for the purposes of Sub-clauses (v) and (vi) of Section 2(47) of the Act is in the
following terms:-
"269UA. Definitions In this Chapter, unless the context otherwise requires,-
(1) to (c) xx xx xx xx xx xx xx
(d) " immovable property" means-
(i) any land or any building or part of a building, and includes, where any land or any
building or part of a building is to be transferred together with any machinery, plant,
furniture, fittings or other things, such machinery, plant, furniture, fittings or other
things also. Explanation.- For the purposes of this sub- clause," land, building, part of
a building, machinery, plant, furniture, fittings and other things" include any rights
therein;
(ii) any rights in or with respect to any land or any building or a part of a building
(whether or not including any machinery, plant, furniture, fittings or other things,
therein) which has been constructed or which is to be constructed, accruing or arising
from any transaction (whether by way of becoming a member of, or acquiring shares
in, a co-
operative society, company or other association of persons or by way of any agreement or any
arrangement of whatever nature), not being a transaction by way of sale, exchange or lease of such
land, building or part of a building;
(e) & (f) xx xx xx xx xx xx xx"
11. Finance Act, 1987 introduced Clauses (v) ands (vi) in Section 2 (47) of the Act with effect from
April 1, 1988. It provides that 'transfer' includes (i) any transaction which allows possession to be
taken/retained in part performance of a contract of the nature referred to in Section 53A of the 1882
Act and (ii) any transaction entered into in any manner which has the effect of transferring or
enabling the enjoyment of any immovable property. Therefore, in these two eventualities, profits on
account of capital gains would be taxable in the year in which such transactions are entered into,
even if the transfer of the immovable property is not effective or complete under the general law.
Under Section 2(47) (v) of the Act, any transaction involving allowing of possession referred to in
Section 53A of the 1882 Act would come within the ambit of 'transfer'. Even arrangements
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 8C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
confirming privileges of ownership without transfer of title could fall under Section 2 (47)(v) of the
Act. Section 2(47)(v) read with Section 45 of the Act indicates that capital gains is taxable in the year
in which such transactions are entered into even if the transfer of immovable property is not
effective or complete under the general law. The purpose of introducing clause (v) in GURBAX
SINGHconjunction with clause (vi) in Section 2(47) of the Act, defining 'transfer' is to widen the net
of taxation of capital gains so as to include transactions that closely resembles transfers but are not
treated as such under the general law. Avoidance or postponement of tax on capital gains by
adopting devices such as the enjoyment of property in pursuance of irrevocable power of attorney or
part performance of a contract of sale is also sought to be arrested by introducing the two clauses,
clause (v) and (vi) in section 2(47) of the Act. According to Explanation to Section 2(47) of the Act,
operative from 1.4.1988 (numbered as Explanation 1 by Finance Act, 2012) for the purposes of sub
clauses (v) and (vi), the expression "immovable property"
shall have the same meaning as in Section 269UA(d) of the Act.
12. The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) Circular No.495 dated 23.9.1987 (168 ITR (St.) 87 at
Page 92) provides an insight into the background and objectives of the said clauses. The relevant
portion is reproduced as under:-
"Definition of "transfer" widened to include certain transactions
- 11.1 The existing definition of the word "transfer" in section 2 (47) does not include
transfer of certain rights accruing to a purchaser, by way of becoming a member of or
acquiring shares in a cooperative society, company or association of persons or by
way of any agreement or any arrangement whereby such person acquires any right in
any building which is either being constructed or which is to be constructed.
Transactions of the nature referred to above are not required to be registered under
the Registration Act, 1908. Such arrangements confer the privileges of ownership
without transfer of title in the building and are a common mode of acquiring flats
particularly in multistoreyed constructions in big cities. The definition also does not
cover cases where possession is allowed to be taken or retained in part performance
of a contract, of the nature referred to in section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act,
1882. New sub clauses (v) and (vi) have been inserted in section 2(47) to prevent
avoidance of capital gains liability by recourse to transfer of rights in the manner
referred to above.
11.2 The newly inserted sub clause (vi) of section 2(47) has brought into the ambit of "transfer", the
practice of enjoyment of property rights through what is commonly known as Power of Attorney
arrangements. The practice in such cases is adopted normally where transfer of ownership is legally
not permitted. A person holding the power of attorney is authorised the powers of owner, including
that of making construction. The legal ownership in such cases continues to be with the transferor.
11.3 These amendments shall come into force with effect from Ist April 1988 and will accordingly
apply to the assessment year 1988-89 and subsequent years (Section 3(g) of the Finance Act, 1987)."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 9C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
13. The legislative intent behind incorporating clause (v) to Section 2(47) of the Act from assessment
year 1988-89 as discernible from CBDT circular is to embrace within its ambit those transactions of
sale of property where assessee enters into agreements for developing properties with builders and
the seller confers the rights and privileges of ownership to the buyer without executing/registering a
formal conveyance deed in order to avoid capital gains tax. In order to thwart such tendencies,
transactions where the possession is given or allowed to be retained in part performance of contract
of the nature referred to in Section 53A of 1882 Act is held to be "transfer" by fiction of law though
under general law it would not be considered to be "transfer". In other words, by deeming fiction,
"transfer" is assigned extended meaning for taxation purposes by incorporating and including that
where possession of any immovable property is taken or retained in part performance of a contract
of the nature referred to in Section 53A of 1882 Act.
14. In CIT vs. K.Jeelani Basha, (2002) 256 ITR 282, the Madras High Court held that once
possession, even of a part of the property was handed over to the transferee, for the purpose of
section 2 (47) (v) read with section 45 of the Act, the transfer was complete. It was held thus:-
"In this case, possession was parted with whereas the assessee/vendor received the
consideration therefor. Once the possession, even of a part of the property was
handed over to the transferee for the purpose of section 2(47)(v) read with section 45,
the transfer was complete and, therefore, the tax authorities and more particularly,
the Tribunal was justified to calculate the consideration received in that particular
year for that part of the property which was parted with. In fact, a reference can be
made to the judgment of the Supreme Court in Alapati Venkataramaiah v. CIT (1963)
57 ITR 185 (SC), which Mr. Rajan relied upon and pointed out that before the
amendment, the transfer was very strictly construed. In the said decision, the
Supreme Court refused to accept the agreement to sell or the entries made in the
account for the receipt of the consideration by the transferor as a completed transfer
for the purpose of then section 12(b). The Supreme Court observed that the transfer
means effective conveyance of capital asset to the transferee and delivery of
possession of immovable could not by itself be treated as equivalent to conveyance of
the immovable property. Relying on this judgment, the learned counsel pointed out
that the amendment has effected a sea change in law, inasmuch as under section 2
(47), the delivery of possession provided it is in the nature as contemplated in section
53A of the Transfer of Property Act, would be enough to bring the transaction into
the mischief of GURBAX SINGH the word "transfer". The argument is undoubtedly
correct.
18. Section 2(47)(v) has probably been introduced to meet the law laid down in this judgment,
wherein there used to be a transfer for all the practical purposes, but the tax could be avoided only
on the sole ground that the transaction was not completed by way of a sale deed. Now, the law
having undergone the change, it would be clear that where there would be a transfer of possession in
the nature as contemplated under section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, the transaction would
be covered as a transfer. By the necessary logic then, that transaction would be coverable in that
particular assessment year as has been done by the Delhi High Court. The only question was as to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 10C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
whether a transaction could be considered for the purpose of calculation of capital gains in parts.
The position in law has been indicated by the Delhi High Court that it can be so treated in parts, we
respectfully agree with the Delhi High Court judgment. However, the only conditions would be that
(1) such a delivery of possession should be in the nature of a doctrine of part-performance under
section 53A for which there should be an agreement between the parties, (2) such agreement should
be in writing, (3) a completed contract has to be spelt out from that agreement, and the most
important (4) the transfer of possession of the property in pursuance of the said agreement. All
these conditions undoubtedly and admittedly are completed here. If that is so, then there would be
no question of interfering with the Tribunal's judgment. In our opinion, the Tribunal has correctly
held that the assessee would have to be assessed on the basis of the transfer of the possession in
proportionate to the consideration."
15. Similar provisions were considered by the Bombay High Court in Chaturbhuj Dwarkadas
Kapadia vs. Commissioner of Income Tax, (2003) 260 ITR 491, wherein it was held that Section
2(47)(v) read with Section 45 of the Act indicates that capital gains was taxable in the year in which
such transactions were entered into even if the transfer of immovable property is not effective or
complete under the general law. The relevant findings read thus:-
"7. Under Section 2(47)(v), any transaction involving allowing of possession to be
taken over or retained in part performance of a contract of the nature referred to in
Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act would come within the ambit of Section
2(47)(v). That, in order to attract Section 53A, the following conditions need to be
fulfilled. There should be a contract for consideration ; it should be in writing ; it
should be signed by the transferor ; it should pertain to transfer of immovable
property ; the transferee should have taken possession of the property ; lastly, the
transferee should be ready and willing to perform his part of the contract. That even
arrangements confirming privileges of ownership without transfer of title could fall
under Section 2(47)(v). Section 2(47)
(v) was introduced in the Act from the assessment year 1988-89 because prior
thereto, in most cases, it was argued on behalf of the assessee that no transfer took
place till execution of the conveyance. Consequently, the assessees used to enter into
agreements for developing properties with the builders and under the arrangement
with the builders, they used to confer privileges of ownership without executing
conveyance and to plug that loophole, Section 2(47)(v) came to be introduced in the
Act.
8. It was argued on behalf of the assessee that there was no effective transfer till grant
of irrevocable licence. In this connection, the judgments of the Supreme Court were
cited on behalf of the assessee, but all those judgments were prior to introduction of
the concept of deemed transfer under section 2 (47)(v). In this matter, the agreement
in question is a development agreement. Such development agreements do not
constitute transfer in general law. They are spread over a period of time. They
contemplate various stages. The Bombay High Court in various judgments has taken
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 11C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
the view in several matters that the object of entering into a development agreement
is to enable a professional builder/contractor to make profits by completing the
building and selling the flats at a profit. That the aim of these professional
contractors was only to make profits by completing the building and, therefore, no
interest in the land stands created in their favour under such agreements. That such
agreements are only a mode of remunerating the builder for his services of
constructing the building (see Gurudev Developers v. Kurla Konkan Niwas
Co-operative Housing Society [2000] 3 Mah LJ 131). It is precisely for this reason
that the Legislature has introduced Section 2(47)(v) read with Section 45 which
indicates that capital gains is taxable in the year in which such transactions are
entered into even if the transfer of immovable property is not effective or complete
under the general law. In this case that test has not been applied by the Department.
No reason has been given why that test has not been applied, particularly when the
agreement in question, read as a whole, shows that it is a development agreement.
There is a difference between the contract on the one hand and the performance on
the other hand. In this case, the Tribunal as well as the Department have come to the
conclusion that the transfer took place during the accounting year ending March 31,
1996, as substantial payments were effected during that year and substantial
permissions were obtained. In such cases of development agreements, one cannot go
by substantial performance of a contract. In such cases, the year of chargeability is
the year in which the contract is executed. This is in view of Section 2(47)(v) of the
Act."
16. Further, the Madras High Court in Commissioner of Income Tax vs. G.Saroja, (2008) 301 ITR
124 had noticed as under:-
"Section 2(47)(v) of the Income-tax Act comes into the aid of the Department only if
the conditions of Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act are satisfied. From a
reading of the above provisions, it is clear that unless there is a written agreement,
Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act will not come into operation. In the
present case, there is no written agreement and no sale consideration was received
during the relevant period. The Revenue is also unable to prove that the assessee had
put the developer in possession of the property by receiving the consideration partly
or in full. The fact remains that there is no sale agreement between the assessee and
the builder and also the assessee had not received the sale consideration. Hence, the
Tribunal is right in holding that there is no transfer of property, as contemplated
under Section 2(47(v) of the Act. The reasons given by the Tribunal are based on
valid materials and evidence and we do not find any error or legal infirmity in the
order of the Tribunal so as to warrant interference."
17. Adverting to clause (vi) of Section 2(47) of the Act, it may be noticed that the scope and ambit of
this clause as explained by CBDT in its circular No.495 dated 23.9.1987 has already been reproduced
above. On perusal of this clause, it would be clear that it was intended to cover those cases of
transfer of ownership where the prospective buyer becomes owner of the property by becoming a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 12C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
member of a company, cooperative society etc. In the present case, JDA was executed between the
society and the developers and there was no transaction involving the developer becoming member
of a cooperative society/company etc. in terms of Section 2(47) (vi) of the Act. The surrender of right
to obtain plot by the members was for GURBAX SINGHfacilitating the society to enter into the JDA
with the developers. There was no change in the membership of the society as contemplated under
Section 2 (47)(vi) of the Act. Equally Clause (ii) of Section 2(47) of the Act has no applicability in as
much as there was no extinguishment of any rights of the assessee in the capital asset at the time of
execution of JDA in the absence of any registered conveyance deed in favour of the transferee in
view of judgments in Alapati Venkataramiah vs. CIT, (1965) 57 ITR 185 (SC) and Additional CIT vs.
Mercury General Corporation (P) Limited, (1982) 133 ITR 525 (Delhi).
18. For determining the ingredients for applicability of Section 53A of 1882 Act, it would be essential
to reproduce the relevant provision which reads as under:-
Section 53A of Transfer of Property Act, 1882 "53A. Part performance.--Where any
person contracts to transfer for consideration any immoveable property by writing
signed by him or on his behalf from which the terms necessary to constitute the
transfer can be ascertained with reasonable certainty, and the transferee has, in part
performance of the contract, taken possession of the property or any part thereof, or
the transferee, being already in possession, continues in possession in part
performance of the contract and has done some act in furtherance of the contract,
and the transferee has performed or is willing to perform his part of the contract,
then, notwithstanding that where there is an instrument of transfer, that the transfer
has not been completed in the manner prescribed therefor by the law for the time
being in force, the transferor or any person claiming under him shall be debarred
from enforcing against the transferee and persons claiming under him any right in
respect of the property of which the transferee has taken or continued in possession,
other than a right expressly provided by the terms of the contract: Provided that
nothing in this section shall affect the rights of a transferee for consideration who has
no notice of the contract or of the part performance thereof."
19. Analyzing the scope of Section 53A of 1882 Act, necessarily, the legislative history of the
provision is required to be scrutinized. Section 53-A was inserted in 1929 by the Transfer of Property
(Amendment) Act, 1929, and imports into India in a modified form the equity of part performance
as it developed in England over the years. Doctrine of part performance as enshrined in Section
53-A of the 1882 Act is an equitable doctrine which creates a bar of estoppel in favour of the
transferee against the transferor. Section 53A of 1882 Act provides protection to a transferee to
retain his possession where in part performance of the contract, he had taken possession of the
property even if the limitation to bring a suit for specific performance had expired. But there are
certain conditions which are required to be fulfilled if a transferee wants to defend or protect his
possession under Section 53-A of the 1882 Act. The Supreme Court in Shrimant Shamrao
Suryavanshi and another vs. Pralhad Bhairoba Suryavanshi (dead) by LRs and others, AIR 2002 SC
960 had reiterated the following to be necessary conditions for applicability of Section 53A of 1882
Act :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 13C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
"1) there must be a contract to transfer for consideration any immovable property;
2) the contract must be in writing, signed by the transferor, or by someone on his
behalf;
3) the writing must be in such words from which the terms necessary to construe the
transfer can be ascertained;
4) the transferee must in part performance of the contract take possession of the
property, or of any part thereof;
5) the transferee must have done some act in furtherance of the contract; and
6) the transferee must have performed or be willing to perform his part of the
contract."
20. Following the aforesaid pronouncement, the Apex Court in Rambhau Namdeo Gajre vs. Narayan
Bapuji Dhgotra (dead) through Lrs, (2004) 8 SCC 614 observed as under:-
"Protection provided under Section 53-A of the Act to the proposed transferee is a
shield only against the transferor. It disentitles the transferor from disturbing the
possession of the proposed transferee who is put in possession in pursuance to such
an agreement. It has nothing to do with the ownership of the proposed transferor
who remains full owner of the property till it is legally conveyed by executing a
registered sale deed in favour of the transferee. Such a right to protect possession
against the proposed vendor cannot be pressed in service against a third party.
An agreement of sale which fulfilled the ingredients of Section 53A of 1882 Act was
not required to be executed through a registered instrument either under 1882 Act or
the Indian Registration Act, 1908 (in short, "the 1908 Act") as originally enacted.
21. The Registration and Other Related Laws (Amendment) Act, 2001 (in short, "the 2001 Act") has
brought about a radical change in the rights flowing on the basis of agreements executed in part
performance of the contract under Section 53A of the 1882 Act. The amendments have been made in
Section 53A of 1882 Act and Sections 17 and 49 of the 1908 Act. The amendment vide 2001 Act
which stood enforced with effect from 24.9.2001, the words "the contract, though required to be
registered, has not been registered, or" in Section 53A of 1882 Act have been omitted.
Simultaneously, Sections 17 and 49 of the 1908 Act have been amended clarifying that unless the
document containing contract to transfer for consideration any immovable property for the purpose
of Section 53A of 1882 Act is registered, it shall not have effect for purposes of Section 53A of 1882
Act. Section 17(1A) as incorporated and Section 49 of the 1908 Act as amended read thus:-
"17(1A). The documents containing contracts to transfer for consideration, any
immovable property for the purpose of section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 14C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
1882 (4 of 1882) shall be registered if they have been executed on or after the
commencement of the Registration and Other Related laws (Amendment) Act, 2001
and if such documents are not registered on or after such commencement, then, they
shall have no effect for the purposes of the said section 53A."
"49. Effect of non-registration of documents required to be registered.--No document
required by section 17 or by any provision of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of
1882)], to be registered shall--
(a) affect any immovable property comprised therein, or
(b) confer any power to adopt, or
(c) be received as evidence of any transaction affecting such property or conferring
such power, unless it has been registered:
Provided that an unregistered document affecting immovable property and required
by this Act or the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of 1882), to be registered may be
received as evidence of a contract in a suit for specific performance under Chapter II
of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 (1 of 1877) or as evidence of any collateral transaction
not required to be effected by registered instrument."
The words "or as evidence of part performance of a contract for the purposes of
Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882" have been omitted from the
Proviso to Section 49.
22. Section 17(1A) of the 1908 Act introduced by the 2001 Act provides that no
benefit would be admissible on the basis of unregistered contract for the purposes of
Section 53A of 1882 Act. Equally, deletion of the words "or as evidence of part
performance of a contract for the purposes of Section 53A of the Transfer of Property
Act" from Proviso to Section 49 of 1908 Act clarifies the effect of non-registration of a
contract executed in terms of Section 53A of 1882 Act. A Division Bench of this Court
interpreting the aforesaid provisions in Ram Kishan and another vs. Bijender Mann
alias Vijender Mann and others, (2013) 1 PLR 195 had succinctly laid down as under:-
"7. A contract/agreement that satisfies the ingredients of Section 53A of 1882 Act was
not compulsory registrable whether under the Transfer of Property Act or the Indian
Registration Act, 1908.
8. The Registration and Other Related laws (Amendment) Act, 2001(hereinafter
referred to as the 'Amendment Act of 2001') has, however, brought about a paradigm
shift in rights flowing from agreements executed under Section 53-A of the Transfer
of Property Act. Section 17(1A) of the Indian Registration Act introduced by
theAmendment Act of 2001, provides that contracts to transfer for consideration any
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 15C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
immovable property for the purpose of Section 53Aof the Transfer of Property Act,
1882, shall be registered if they have been executed on or after the commencement of
the Registration and Other Related Law (Amendment) Act, 2001. Section
17(1A)further provides that, in case, such a document is not registered, it shall have
no effect, for the purpose of Section 53A. A combined reading of Sections 53A and
17(1A), reveals that a contract that evidences part performance, as envisaged by
Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act shall, after enactment of Section 17(1A),
be compulsorily registrable and if not so registered, shall have no effect for the
purpose of Section 53A of the 1882 Act. Section 17(1A) reads as follows:-
"Section 17(1A) of Indian Registration Act, 1908 The documents containing contracts
to transfer for consideration, any immovable property for the purpose of Section 53A
of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of 1882) shall be registered if they have been
executed on or after the commencement of the Registration and Other Related Law
(Amendment) Act, 2001 and if such documents are not registered on or after such
commencement, then, they shall have no effect for the purposes of the said Section
53A.
9. Section 17(1A) of the 1908 Act declares in no uncertain terms if a contract executed
in part performance of an agreement is unregistered, it shall have no effect for the
purpose of Section 53A of the 1882 Act. Section 17(1A) does not refer to much less
prohibit the filing of a suit for specific performance or leading of such a contractinto
evidence.
10. The Amendment Act also introduced a proviso to Section 49 of the Indian
Registration Act, to clarify the effect of non-
registration of a contract executed in terms of Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act. Section
49 of the Registration Act 1908, reads as follows:-
"49. Effect of non-registration of documents required to be registered.-- No
document required by Section 17 or by any provision of the Transfer of Property Act,
1882 to be registered shall-
(a) affect any immovable property comprised therein, or
(b) confer any power to adopt, or
(c) be received as evidence of any transaction affecting such property or conferring
such power; unless it has been registered:
Provided that an unregistered document affecting immovable property and required
by this Act or the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, to be registered may be received as
evidence of a contract in a suit for specific performance under Chapter II of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 16C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
Specific Relief Act, 1877, or as evidence of part performance of a contract for the
purposes of Section 53A of the Transfer of Property or as evidence of any collateral
transaction not required to be effected by registered instrument."
11. A conjoint appraisal of Sections 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882,
Sections 17(1A) and 49 of the Indian Registration Act, 1908, particularly the proviso
to Section 49 of the Indian Registration Act, in our considered opinion, leaves no
ambiguity that, though, a contract accompanied by delivery of possession or executed
in favour of a person in possession, is compulsorily registrable under Section 17(1A)
of the Registration Act, 1908, but the failure to register such a contract would only
deprive the person in possession of any benefit conferred by Section 53A of the 1882
Act. The proviso to Section 49 of the Indian Registration Act clearly postulates that
non-registration of such a contract would not prohibit the filing of a suit for specific
performance based upon such an agreement or the leading of such an unregistered
agreement into evidence.
12. A suit for specific performance based upon an unregistered agreement to sell
accompanied by delivery of possession or executed in favour of a person who is
already in possession, cannot, therefore, be said to be barred by Section 17 (1A) of the
Registration Act, 1908.
13. Section 17(1A) merely declares that such an unregistered contract shall not be
pressed into service for the purpose of Section 53(A) of the Transfer of Property Act,
1882. Section 17 (1A) of the Registration Act, 1908, does not, whether in specific
terms or by necessary intent, prohibit the filing of a suit for specific performance
based upon an unregistered agreement to sell, that records delivery of possession or
is executed in favour of a person to whom possession is delivered and the proviso to
Section 49 of the Indian Registration Act, 1908 put paid to any argument to the
contrary.
14. We, therefore, hold that:
(a) a suit for specific performance, based upon an unregistered contract/agreement
to sell that contains a clause recording part performance of the contract by delivery of
possession or has been executed with a person, who is already in possession shall not
be dismissed for want of registration of the contract/agreement;
(b) the proviso to Section 49 of the Registration Act, legitimises such a contract to the
extent that, even though unregistered, it can form the basis of a suit for specific
performance and be led into evidence as proof of the agreement or part performance
of a contract."
In Sukhwinder Kaur vs. Amarjit Singh and others, (2012) ILR 2 Punjab and Haryana 718, a single
Bench of this Court observed as follows:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 17C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
"8. Section 53-A of the TPA before amendment prescribed that where in pursuance to
part performance of the contract, the transferee has taken possession of the property
and has done some act in furtherance of the contract, and the transferor has
performed or is will to perform his part of the contact then despite the fact that the
contract was required to be registered and has not been registered, the transferrer
shall be debarred from enforcing against the transferee any right other than a right
expressly provided by the contract. Meaning thereby, GURBAX SINGH Section 53-A
of the TPA recognized part performance of the contract even though the contract
used to be unregistered and the transferee's rights to remain in possession was
protected. By the amendment Act No.48 of 2001 (w.e.f. 24.9.2001), the words "the
contract, though required to be registered, has not been registered, or" have been
omitted from the provision. The effect of the amendment is that now if any person
takes possession in pursuance to a contract which is required to be registered but has
not been registered, the transferee has no right to remain in possession of the
property. To give effect to this principle,Section 17(1A) has accordingly been inserted
in the Act which mandates that such contract is now required to be registered. If such
a contract entered into after the amendment is not registered then per Section 49 of
the Act, the same can neither affect any immovable property comprised therein nor
will it be received as evidence of any transaction affecting such property or conferring
such power."
Similarly, Delhi High Court in MAC Associates vs. S.P. Singh Chandel and another, RFA No.518 of
2011 decided on 7.2.2013, dealing with essential requirements of registration in an agreement under
Section 53A of 1882 Act after 24.9.2001 noticed as under:-
"13. If the matter is viewed from another angle then also suit for possession on the
basis of Collaboration Agreement, which at best can be taken at par with the
Agreement to Sell, is not maintainable even if, for the sake of arguments, it is
accepted that the respondent was agent of appellant. Agreement to Sell does not vest
any right in favour of a person to the possession of property. Even if a person is put in
possession of property through an Agreement to Sell, he cannot protect his
possession on the pretext of part performance under Section 53-A of the Transfer of
Property Act, 1882 unless such an agreement is a registered document. Section 17
(1A) of the Registration Act, 1908, which has come into force with effect from 24th
September, 2001, reads as under:-
'Documents containing contracts to transfer for consideration, any immoveable
property for purpose of Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 shall be
registered if they have been executed on or after the commencement of the
Registration and other Related Laws (Amendment) Act, 2001 and if such documents
are not registered on or after such commencement, they shall have no effect for the
purpose of the said Section 53-A.' Once a person cannot even protect the possession,
which he is holding, in absence of an unregistered Agreement to Sell, then how such a
person can seek possession on the basis of such a document. In Sunil Kapoor v/s
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 18C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
Himmat Singh & Ors. 167 (2010) Delhi Law Times 806, a Single Judge of this Court
has held thus "a mere agreement to sell of immovable property does not create any
right in the property save the right to enforce the said agreement. Thus, even if the
respondents/plaintiffs are found to have agreed to sell the property, the
petitioner/defendant would not get any right to occupy that property as an agreement
purchaser. This Court in Jiwan Das v/s Narain Das, AIR 1981 Delhi 291 has held that
in fact no right inure to the agreement purchaser, not even after the passing of a
decree for specific performance and till conveyance in accordance with law and in
pursuance thereto is executed."
23. Having elaborated the scope and legislative intent of Section 2 (47)(ii), (v) and (vi) of the Act and
also the mandatory ingredients for applicability of Section 53A of 1882 Act, it would be essential to
notice that the provisions of section 53A of 1882 Act have been introduced in Section 2 (47)(v) of the
Act by incorporation. The concept of inclusion of a provision of another statute by incorporation has
been dealt with by the Apex Court in detail in Surana Steels Pvt. Limited vs. DCIT, (1999) 237 ITR
777. The issue before the Apex Court in Surana Steels Pvt. Limited's case (supra) was relating to
computation of book profit under Section 115J of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Section 205 of the
Companies Act, 1956 provided that past losses or unabsorbed depreciation, whichever is loss shall
be allowed as set off against the book profits of the current year for determining profits for the
purpose of declaring dividend. Explanation clause (iv) to Section 115J of the Act incorporated that
book profits shall be reduced by the amount of the loss or the amount of depreciation which would
be required to be set off against the profit of the relevant previous year as if the provisions of clause
(6) of the first proviso to sub section (1) of Section 205 of the Companies Act, 1956 are applicable. It
was pronounced that there is no reason to assign to the term "loss" as occurring in Section 205,
Proviso clause (b) of the Companies Act, a meaning different from the one in which it is understood
therein solely because it is being read alongwith Section 115J of the Act. While dealing with the
principles relating to interpretation of taxing statute where there was inclusion of a provision of
another statute, it was held that provision must be construed in the sense it bore in statute from
which it is taken. It was recorded as under:-
"Section 115J, Explanation clause (iv), is a piece of legislation by incorporation.
Dealing with the subject, Justice G.P. Singh states in Principles of Statutory
Interpretation (7th edition,1999)-
"Incorporation of an earlier Act into a later Act is a legislative GURBAX SINGH
device adopted for the sake of convenience in order to avoid verbatim reproduction of
the provisions of the earlier Act into the later. When an earlier Act or certain of its
provisions are incorporated by reference into a later Act, the provisions so
incorporated become part and parcel of the later Act as if they had been "bodily
transposed into it". The effect of incorporation is admirably stated by LORD ESHER,
M.R. "If a subsequent Act brings into itself by reference some of the clauses of a
former Act, the legal effect of that, as has often been held, is to write those sections
into the new Act as if they had been actually written in it with the pen, or printed in
it. " (p.233) "Even though only particular sections of an earlier Act are incorporated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 19C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
into later, in construing the incorporated sections it may be at times necessary and
permissible to refer to other parts of the earlier statute which are not incorporated.
As was stated by LORD BLACKBURN: "When a single section of an Act of Parliament
is introduced into another Act. I think it must be read in the sense it bore in the
original Act from which it was taken, and that consequently it is perfectly legitimate
to refer to all the rest of that Act in order to ascertain what the sections meant,
though those other sections are not incorporated in the new Act".
24. Similarly, following the Apex Court judgment in Surana Steels Pvt. Limited's case (supra), the
Gauhati High Court in Assam Bengal Carriers Limited vs. CIT, (1999) 239 ITR 862 (Gauhati),
observed that when a legal fiction is created for an obvious purpose, full effect of it is to be given.
The relevant observations read thus:-
"xxxxxx When a legal fiction is created for an obvious purpose full effect of it is to be
given--there is no half way house, In this regard it would be advantageous to rehearse
the following passage from Lord Asquith in East End Dwellings Co. Ltd. v. Finsbury
Borough Council, [1951] 2 All ER 587 (HL) "If you GURBAX SINGH are bidden to
treat an imaginary state of affairs as real, you must surely, unless prohibited from
doing so, also imagine as real, the consequences and incidents which if the putative
state of affairs had in fact existed, must inevitably have flowed from or accompanied
it. ... The statute says that you must imagine a certain state of affairs, it does not say
that having done so, you must cause or permit your imagination to boggle when it
comes to the inevitable corollaries of that state of affairs." While interpreting the
deeming provision contained in Section 43 of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, the
Privy Council hold that under the circumstances sot out therein an agent was also
chargeable to income-tax as of an assessee. In CIT v. Bombay Trust Corporation, AIR
1930 PC 54, Viscount Dunedin in the aforesaid case observed (page 55): "Now when a
person is 'deemed to be' something the only meaning possible is that whereas he is
not in reality that something the Act of Parliament requires him to be treated as if he
were." The Supreme Court also dealt in a similar manner indicated also for giving full
effect to a legal fiction ref. State of Bombay v. Pandurang Vinayak, AIR 1953 SC 244 ;
CIT v. S. Teja Singh, [1959] 35 ITR 408 (SC) ; Rajputna Trading Co. Ltd. v. CIT
[1969] 72 ITR 286 (SC) ; A. S. Glittre D/5 I/S Garonne v. CIT, [1997] 225 ITR 739
(SC). There is also no statutory exception excluding the operation of Section 115J of
the Act."
Thus, it would mean that Section 53A of 1882 Act has been bodily transposed into Section 2(47)(v)
of the Act and the effect of it would be that Section 53A of 1882 Act shall be taken to be an integral
part of Section 2 (47)(v) of the Act. In other words, the legal requirements of Section 53A of 1882
Act are required to be fulfilled so as to attract the provisions of Section 2(47)(v) of the Act.
25. Examining the question of possession, one of the essential conditions for enforceability of
Section 53A of 1882 Act is that the transferee must in part performance of the contract take
possession of the property or any part thereof. There is a serious dispute with regard to the nature of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 20C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
possession contemplated by Section 53A of 1882 Act. It was contended on behalf of the
appellant-assessee that reference to the possession of the transferee as postulated under Section 53A
of 1882 Act is that it must have been delivered in furtherance to the contract and should be sole,
exclusive and cannot be concurrent. The possession is not to be in any other capacity to invoke
Section 53A of 1882 Act. On the other hand, learned counsel for the revenue, drawing support from
the judgment delivered by Authority for Advance Ruling (AAR) in Re Jasbir Singh Sarkaria, (2007)
294 ITR 196 (AAR) submitted that there can be concurrent possession of the transferor as well as of
the transferee and it would be enough if the transferee has, by virtue of the transaction, a right to
enter upon and exercise acts of possession effectively pursuant to the covenants in the contract.
Reliance was placed upon following observations for meaning of possession and how should it be
understood in the context of clause (v) of Section 2(47) of the Act:-
"24. The next question is, in what sense we have to understand the term 'possession'
in the context of clause (v) of section 2 (47). Should it only mean the right to exclusive
possession -
which the transferee can maintain in his own right to the exclusion of everyone including the
transferor from whom he derived the possession? Such a criterion will be satisfied only after the
entire sale consideration is paid and the transferor has forfeited his right to exercise acts of
possession over the land or to resume possession. In our view, there is no warrant to place such a
restricted interpretation on the word 'possession' occurring in clause (v) of section 2(47). Possession
is an abstract concept. It has different shades of meaning. It is variously described as "a
polymorphous term having different meanings in different contexts" (per R.S. Sarkaria, J in Supdt
and Legal Remebrancer, W.B. v. Anil Kumar) and as a word of "open texture" (see Salmond on
Jurisprudence, Para 51, Twelth Edition, Indian reprint). Salmond observed : "to look for a definition
that will summarize the meanings of the term "possession" in ordinary language, in all areas of law
and in all legal systems, is to ask for the impossible". In the above case of Anil Kumar, Sarkaria, J.
speaking for a 3 Judge Bench also referred to the comments of Dias and Hughes in their book on
Jurisprudence that "if a topic ever suffered too much theorizing it is that of "possession". Much of
the difficulty is caused by the fact that possession is not a pure legal concept, as pointed out by
Salmond. The learned Judge then explained the connotation of the expression "possession" by
referring to the well known treatises on Jurisprudence:
"Possession", implies a right and a fact : the right to enjoy annexed to the right to
property and the fact of the real intention. It involves power of control and intent to
control. (see Dias and Huges)
14. ...
15. While recognizing that 'possession' is not a purely legal concept but also a matter
of fact, Salmond (12th Ed., 52) describes possession, in fact", as a relationship
between a person and a thing. According to the learned author, the test for
determining 'whether a person is in possession of anything is whether he is in general
control of it.:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 21C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
25. In Salmond's Jurisprudence, at para 54, we find an illuminating discussion on
"immediate" and "mediate possession". The learned author states "in law one person
may possess a thing for and on account of some one else. In such a case the latter is in
possession by the agency of him who so GURBAX SINGH holds the thing on his
behalf. The possession thus held by one man through another may be termed
mediate, while that which is acquired or retained directly or personally may be
distinguished as "immediate or direct"." Salmond makes reference to three types of
mediate possession. In all cases of "mediate possession", two persons are in
possession of the same thing at the same time. An allied concept of concurrent
possession has also been explained in para 55 of Salmond's Jurisprudence in the
following words:
It was a maxim of the civil law that two persons could not be in possession of the
same thing at the same time. As a general proposition this is true : for exclusiveness
is of the essence of possession. Two adverse claims of exclusive use cannot both be
effectually realized at the same time. Claims, however, which are not adverse, and
which are not, therefore, mutually destructive, admit of concurrent realization.
Hence, there are several possible cases of duplicate possession.
1. Mediate and immediate possession coexist in respect of the same thing as already
explained.
2. Two or more persons may posses the same thing in common, just as they may owe
it in common....
26. On a fair and reasonable interpretation and on adopting the principle of purposive construction,
it must be held that possession contemplated by clause (v) need not necessarily be sole and exclusive
possession. So long as the transferee is, by virtue of the possession given, enabled to exercise general
control over the property and to make use of it for the intended purpose, the mere fact that the
owner has also the right to enter the property to oversee the development work or to ensure
performance of the terms of agreement does not introduce any incompatibility. The concurrent
possession of the owner who can exercise possessory rights to a limited extent and for a limited
purpose and that of the buyer/developer who has general control and custody of the land can very
well be GURBAX SINGH reconciled. Clause (v) of section 2(47) will have its full play even in such a
situation. There is no warrant to postpone the operation of clause (v) and the resultant accrual of
capital gain to a point of time when the concurrent possession will become exclusive possession of
developer/transferee after he pays full consideration.
27. Further, if 'possession' referred to in clause (v) is to be understood as exclusive possession of the
transferee/developer, then, the very purpose of the amendment expanding the definition of transfer
for the purpose of capital gains may be defeated. The reason is this: the owner of the property can
very well contend, as is being contended in the present case, that the developer will have such
exclusive possession in his own right only after the entire amount is paid to the owner to the last pie.
There is then a possibility of staggering the last installment of a small amount to a distant date, may
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 22C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
be, when the entire building complex gets ready. Even if some amount, say 10 per cent, remains to
be paid and the developer/transferee fails to pay, leading to a dispute between the parties, the right
to exclusive and indefeasible possession may be in jeopardy. In this state of affairs, the transaction
within the meaning of clause (v) cannot be said to have been effected and the liability to pay capital
gains may be indefinitely postponed. True, it may not be profitable for the developer to allow this
situation to linger for long as the process of transfer of flats to the prospective purchasers will get
delayed. At the same time, the other side of the picture cannot be over-looked. There is a possibility
of the owner with the connivance of the transferee postponing the payment of capital gain tax on the
ostensible ground that the entire consideration has not been received and some balance is left. The
mischief sought to be remedied, will then perpetuate. We are, therefore of the view that possession
given to the developers need not ripen itself into exclusive possession on payment of all the
instalments in entirety for the GURBAX SINGH purpose of determining the date of transfer.
28. While on the point of possession, we would like to clarify one more aspect. What is spoken to in
clause (v) of section 2 (47) is the 'transaction' which involves allowing the possession to be taken. By
means of such transaction, a transferee like a developer is allowed to undertake development work
on the land by assuming general control over the property in part performance of the contract. The
date of that transaction determines the date of transfer. The actual date of taking physical
possession or the instances of possessory acts exercised is not very relevant. The ascertainment of
such date, if called for, leads to complicated inquiries, which may frustrate the objective of the
legislative provision. It is enough if the transferee has, by virtue of that transaction, a right to enter
upon and exercise acts of possession effectively pursuant to the covenants in the contract. That
tantamounts to legal possession. We are referring to this aspect because the authorized
representative has submitted when he appeared before us in the last week of May, 2007 that even by
that date the development work could not be commenced for want of certain approvals, and
therefore, the developer was " not willing to take possession of the land". Such an unsubstantiated
statement which is not found in the original application or even written submissions filed earlier
need not be probed into especially when it is not his case that the developer was not allowed to take
possession in terms of the agreement."
26. The Supreme Court considering the requirement of delivery of possession for a case to be falling
under the provisions of Section 53A of 1882 Act, in Sardar Govindrao Mahadik and another vs. Devi
Sahai and others, AIR 1982 SC 989 had dealt as follows:-
"31. While text book writers and English decisions may shed some light to illuminate
the blurred areas as to whether part payment of purchase money or even the whole of
the consideration would not be sufficient act of part performance, it is necessary that
this aspect may be examined in the background of statutory requirement as enacted
in section 53A. To qualify for the protection of the doctrine of part performance it
must be shown that there is a contract to transfer for consideration immovable
property and the contract is evidenced by a writing signed by the person sought to be
bound by it and from which the terms necessary to constitute the transfer can be
ascertained with reasonable certainty. These are pre-requisites to invoke the
equitable doctrine of part performance. After establishing the aforementioned
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 23C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
circumstances it must be further shown that a transferee had in part performance of
the contract either taken possession of the property or any part thereof or the
transferee being already in possession continues in possession in part performance of
the contract and has done some act in furtherance of the contract. The acts claimed to
be in part performance must be unequivocally referable to the pre-existing contract
and the acts of part performance must unequivocally point in the direction of the
existence of contract and evidencing implementation or performance of contract.
There must be a real nexus between the contract and the acts done in pursuance of
the contract or in furtherance of the contract and must be unequivocally referable to
the contract. When series of acts are done in part performance, one such may be
payment of consideration. Any one act by itself may or may not be of such a
conclusive nature as to conclude the point one way or the other but when taken with
many others payment of part of the consideration or the whole of the consideration
may as well be shown to be in furtherance of contract. The correct approach would be
what Lord Reid said in Steadman's case that one must not first took at the oral
contract and then see whether the alleged acts of part performance are consistent
with it. One must first look at the GURBAX SINGH alleged acts of part performance
and see whether they prove that there must have been a contract and it is only if they
do so prove that one can bring in the oral contract. This view may not be wholly
applicable to the situation in India because an oral contract is not envisaged by
section 53A. Even for invoking the equitable doctrine of part performance there has
to be a contract in writing from which the terms necessary to constitute the transfer
can be ascertained with reasonable certainty. Therefore, the correct view in India
would be, look at that writing that is offered as a contract for transfer for
consideration of any immovable property and then examine the acts said to have
been done in furtherance of the contract and find out whether there is a real nexus
between the contract and the acts pleaded as in part performance so that to refuse
relief would be perpetuating the fraud of the party who after having taken advantage
or benefit of the contract backs out and pleads non registration as defence, a defence
analogous to section 4 of the Statute of Frauds.
32. We may recall here that the acts preliminary to the contract would be hardly of
any assistance in ascertaining whether they were in furtherance of the contract.
Anything done in furtherance of the contract postulates the pre- existing contract and
the acts done in furtherance thereof. Therefore, the acts interior to the contract or
merely incidental to the contract would hardly provide any evidence of part
performance."
27. Applying the principle of law laid down in Sardar Govindrao Mahadik's case (supra), the Apex
Court in D.S.Parvathamma vs. A.Srinivasan, AIR 2003 SC 3542 reiterated as under:-
"9. Secondly, the appellant has failed to allege and prove that he was delivered
possession in part performance of the contract or he, being already in possession as
lessee, continued in possession in part performance of the agreement to purchase, i.e.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 24C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
by mutual agreement between the parties his possession as lessee ceased and
commenced as that of a transferee under the contract. On the contrary, there is a
finding recorded in the earlier suit that in spite of his having entered into a contract
to purchase the property he had not disowned his character as lessee and he was
treated as such by the parties. The judgment dated 1.9.1999 in the Civil Suit notes the
conduct of the plaintiff inconsistent with his conduct as vendee in possession. When
a person already in possession of the property in some other capacity enters into a
contract to purchase the property, to confer the benefit of protecting possession
under the plea of part performance his act effective from that day must be consistent
with the contract alleged and also such as cannot be referred to the preceding title.
The High Court of Madhya Pradesh had an occasion to deal with the facts very near
to the facts before us in Bhagwandas Parsadilal Vs. Surajmal& Anr., AIR 1961 M.P.
237. A tenant in possession entered into an agreement to purchase the house forming
subject matter of tenancy. However, he failed to show his nature of possession having
altered from that of a tenant into that of a transferee. In a suit of ejectment based on
landlord-tenant relationship, the tenant sought to protect his possession by raising
the plea of part performance as against subsequent purchaser of the property.
Referring to Section 91 of Indian Trust Act, the High Court held that a subsequent
purchaser of the property with notice of an existing contract affecting that property
must hold the property for the benefit of the person in whose favour the prior
agreement to sell has been executed to the extent it is necessary to give effect to that
contract. But that does not mean that till a final decision has been reached the
contract creates a right in the person in possession, i.e. the tenant, to refuse to
surrender possession of the premises even if such possession was obtained by him
not in part performance of the contract but in his capacity as a tenant. Having
entered into possession as a GURBAX SINGH tenant and having continued to remain
in possession in that capacity he cannot be heard to say that by reason of the
agreement to sell his possession was no longer that of a tenant. (Also see
Dakshinamurthi Mudaliar (Dead) & Ors. Vs. Dhanakoti Ammal, AIR 1925 Madras
965 and A.M.A. Sultan (deceased by LRs) & Ors. Vs. Seydu Zohra Beevi, AIR 1990
Kerala 186) In our opinion the law has been correctly stated by the High Court of
Madhya Pradesh in the abovesaid decision."
28. In Thota Rambabu alias Ramu vs. Cherukuri Venkateswara Rao alias Pedababu and others, AIR
2006 AP 114, the Andhra Pradesh High Court while considering the question of requirement of
delivery of possession for claiming benefits of Section 53A of 1882 Act in a suit for relief of specific
performance of an agreement of sale, observed as under:-
"30. Now the third point: The plaintiff raised a plea, as to his entitlement for the
benefit under Section 53-A of the Act. Specific issue was framed and extensive
discussion was undertaken by the Trial Court on this. It is true that Section 53-A of
the Act is basically a legal weapon to be used in defence to protect the possession,
under an agreement of transfer, if the person in possession is ready and willing to
perform his part of contract. In the recent past, Courts have recognized that this
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 25C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
provision can be treated as a source of independent right, and that it can be enforced
by filing a suit.
31. One of the most important ingredients of Section 53-A of the Act is that the
person claiming the benefit under it, must be in possession of the property, which is
the subject-matter of the contemplated transfer. By its very nature, possession is a
fluid concept, and is not susceptible to any precise definition. For the most part of it,
possession was treated as a question of fact, and was held to depend upon the
purpose, as well as the connection with which it arises. Shartel, in his Article
"Meanings of Possession" [(1932) 16 Minnesota Law Review GURBAX SINGH 611],
observed as under:
"I want to make the point that there are many meanings of the word 'possession'; that
possession can only be usefully defined with reference to the purpose in hand; and
that possession may have one meaning in one connection and another meaning in
another".
32. Jurists hailing from various legal systems have pointed out that possession, as a legal concept,
has two components, viz., corpus possessions, physical possession of the property and animus
possidendi, i.e. the intention to hold it as of right. Their difference of approach was only as to the
emphasis on these ingredients, to constitute a position in law. In his treatise on the Common Law,
O.W. Holmes [Holmes The Common Law Ch 6,], observed as under:
"To gain possession, then, a man must stand in a certain physical relation to the
object and to the rest of the world, and must have a certain intent. These relations
and this intent are the facts of which we are in search".
33. Opinions drastically varied, as to whether possession is a question of fact, or of law. While some
jurists treated it as a pure question of fact, others held it to be matter of law. Dias, in his treatise on
'Jurisprudence', struck a balance and observed, as under (Dias Jurisprudence Fifth Edition Page-
290):
"Possession has three aspects: firstly, the relation between a person and a thing is a
fact. Secondly, the advantages attached by law to that relation is a matter of law.
Thirdly, these advantages are also attributed to a person when certain other facts
exist. What they are in any given type of case is a matter of law".
34. Where the possession of a property, movable or immovable, is physically delivered to another, it
is not difficult to discern, as to who exactly is in possession of such property. Difficulty, however,
arises, where the delivery is GURBAX SINGH implied or symbolical. It is only an examination of a
bunch of facts, that would yield an answer to this. In the instant case, the plaintiff pleaded that
symbolical delivery of possession was affected to him. Admittedly, the 1st defendant is owner of only
1/4th share of the rice mill and that the mill, as a whole, was under lease to a third party.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 26C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
35. Section 53-A of Act is clear to the effect that the person claiming benefit under it, must have
"taken possession of the property". This can happen, if the transferee was delivered physical
possession of the property. It can also happen when a symbolical delivery of possession was effected,
such as by attornment of the existing lease over such property. Where the contemplated transfer
relates to an undivided share, Section 53-A takes a different colour. The reason is that, there cannot
be delivery of possession of property by a co-owner, of an undivided property, or the corresponding
taking possession of such property by the transferee. Section 44 of the Act makes this abundantly
clear. It reads as under:
"Sec. Transfer by one co-owner :--Where one of two or more co-owners of immovable
property legally competent in that behalf transfers his share of such property or any
interest therein, the transferee acquires as to such share or interest, and so far as is
necessary to give, effect to the transfer, the transferor's right to joint possession or
other common or part enjoyment of the property, and to enforce a partition of the
same, but subject to the conditions and liabilities affecting at the date of the transfer,
the share or interest so transferred.
Where the transferee of a share of a dwelling-house belonging to an undivided family
is not a member of the family, nothing in this section shall be deemed to entitle him
to joint possession or other common or part enjoyment of the house".
It mandates that, what a transferee, from a co-owner of an GURBAX SINGH undivided property,
gets, is a right, to enforce a partition, that too, subject to conditions and liabilities, in relation to the
property, by the date of transfer.
36. The phenomena of co-ownership of an undivided property, on the one hand, and delivering of
physical or symbolical possession thereof do not co-exist. In fact, they are mutually exclusive. In
Saleem, S/o. Yaseen v. I Additional Civil Judge, Senior Division, Saharanpur, , it was held that the
right of a transferee under Section 53-A of the Act does not have the effect of superceding, or
frustrating the provisions of Section 44 of the Act. To the same effect is the judgment of the Supreme
Court in Dorab Cawasji Warden v. Coomi Sorab Warden, . Though they related to the second limb of
Section 44, by and large, the principle remains the same.
37. In Smt. Lalita James v. Ajit Kumar, and Ashim Ranjandas v. Smt. Bimala Ghosh, , it was held
that a transferee from a co-owner of a portion of undivided property is not entitled to right of
exclusive possession, and that he can, at the best, enforce a partition of joint estate. The Himachal
Pradesh High Court in its judgment in Paldev Singh v. Smt. Darshani Devi, , observed that a
co-owner cannot be said to be in actual physical or exclusive possession of any parcel, till a partition
takes place, and the question of his delivering the possession of such an undivided share does not
arise. Authorities can be multiplied on this aspect. The gist is that the transferee from a co-owner of
an undivided property gets nothing more than a right to seek partition, and thereafter, secure
possession of the share of property purchased by him, and he cannot claim any exclusive possession,
on the basis of such transfer till the partitions takes place. Resultantly, such a transferee cannot
claim the benefit of Section 53-A, since he does not gain or take possession of I the subject-matter of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 27C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
transfer.
38. Even if we assume that the 1st defendant was in exclusive possession of the suit schedule
property, it is difficult to invoke Section 53-A in favour of the plaintiff. The reason is that, except
pleading that a symbolic delivery of possession was effected to him, the plaintiff would not prove its
ingredients. One of the most well-recognized methods of symbolic delivery of possession of
immovable property is, by attorning existing lease in favour of the transferee. Such attornment can
take place either with the direct participation of the lessee, in a tripartite transaction, or through
intimation by the transferor to the lessee about the latter's obligations to pay the rents to the
transferee, henceforth. Even where no such specific steps are taken, an implied symbolic, delivery of
possession can be culled out, if the transferee is able to prove to the satisfaction of the Court, that he
is started receiving the rents of the property, subsequent to the agreement, as of right.
39. In the absence of any of the circumstances referred to above, the Court cannot infer delivery of
possession in favour of a transferee. Taking of possession, being one of the most important
ingredients of Section 53-A, the plaintiff cannot derive the benefit of that provision, once he failed to
prove that he has taken possession of the suit schedule property."
29. Similarly, Delhi High Court in M/s R.K.Apartments Pvt. Limited and another vs. Smt.Aruna
Bahree and others, (1998) 2 ILR 727 (Del.), delving into the issue of possession under Section 53A of
1882 Act, had recorded as under:-
"14. From the aforesaid statements made in both the Articles it is manifest that the
legal position enunciated in Hounslow London Borough's case (supra), is no more a
good law. Possession of the suit land delivered to defendants 1 & 2 at the time of the
execution of the agreements dated 1st/11th March, 1985 was only by way of
temporary measure for undertaking the construction work by them and the exclusive
possession thereof in legal sense remained with the executants of the said
agreements. Thus, defendants 1 & 2 prima facie are not entitled to protect their
possession over the suit land under said Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property
Act."
30. The concept of possession to be defined is an enormous task to be precisely elaborated.
"Possession" is a word of open texture. It is an abstract notion. It implies a right to enjoy which is
attached to the right to property. It is not purely a legal concept but is a matter of fact. The issue of
ownership depends on rule of law whereas possession is a question dependent upon fact without
reference to law. To put it differently, ownership is strictly a legal concept and possession is both a
legal and a non-legal or pre-legal concept. The test for determining whether any person is in
possession of anything is to see whether it is under his general control. He should be actually
holding, using and enjoying it, without interference on the part of others. The AAR in Jasbir Singh
Sarkaria's case (supra) had observed that there can be concurrent possession of the owner who can
exercise possessory rights to a limited extent and for a limited purpose and that of the
buyer/developer who has general control and custody of the land. It was also noticed that
possession contemplated by clause (v) of Section 2 (47) of the Act need not necessarily be sole and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 28C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
exclusive possession. The legality of these conclusions was, however questioned by learned counsel
for the assessee. In our opinion, broadly speaking, the aforesaid proposition enunciated by AAR may
not be faulted as it would depend upon facts and circumstances of individual cases on the
construction of combined documents executed between the parties. The primary issue before AAR
was the year of chargeability of the income to capital gain tax. Integrally connected to it was the
identification of the previous year in which the deemed transfer within the meaning of clause (v) of
Section 2(47) of the Act had taken place. It was observed that once it was held that the transaction of
the nature referred to in clause (v) of section 2(47) of the Act had taken place on a particular date,
the actual date of taking physical possession need not be probed into. It is enough if the transferee
has by virtue of that transaction a right to enter upon and exercise the acts of possession effectively.
It was further held in that case that the capital gains which arose during the financial year 2006-07
shall be subjected to tax for the assessment year 2007-08. The aforesaid observations were recorded
in that context on the facts involved therein. It would have to be ascertained in each case
independently whether a transferee has been delivered possession in furtherance of the contract in
order to fall under Section 53A of the 1882 Act and thus amenable to tax by virtue of Section
2(47)(v) read with Section 45 of the Act.
31. Lastly, both the parties had hotly and with great vehemence contested the question of delivery of
possession under the JDA dated 25.2.2007 and also the registered special power of attorney dated
26.2.2007. It would be expedient to notice the respective submissions of the learned counsel for the
parties. Firstly, noting the arguments of the assessee, reliance was placed on Section 52 of the
Indian Easement Act, 1882 which defines 'licence' in the following terms:-
"52. "License" defined.- Where one person grants to another, or to a definite number
of other persons, a right to do, or continue to do, in or upon the immovable property
of the grantor, something which would, in the absence of such right, be unlawful, and
such right does not amount to an easement or an interest in the property, the right is
called a license."
It was contended that possession was handed over to the transferee as a licencee to carry out
development of the property. No possession was ever given by the transferor to the transferee in
part performance of the JDA dated 25.2.2007. JDA had not conferred any right to own the property
on the transferee but only to develop it. Even registered irrevocable special power of attorney
nowhere specified granting possession in part performance of JDA dated 25.2.2007 as required
under Section 53A of the 1882 Act.
32. Further, in order to demonstrate that no absolute possession as required under section 53A of
the 1882 Act had been delivered by the transferor to the transferee, learned counsel for the
assessee-appellant extensively drew the attention of the court to various relevant clauses of the JDA
dated 25.2.2007 and also the registered special power of attorney dated 26.2.2007 as under:-
(I) Clauses of JDA dated 25.2.2007

33. Conversely, learned counsel for the revenue, argued that where the intention and facts are
contained in more than one document between the same parties, they are required to be read and
interpreted together by taking them to be one document. To garner support, reliance was placed on
the following observations in the judgment of the Supreme Court in S.Chathanatha Karayalar vs.
The Central Bank of India Limited and others, AIR 1965 SC 1856:-
"The first question presented for determination in this case is whether the status of
the 3rd defendant in regard to the transaction of overdraft account is that of a surety
or of a co- obligant. It was argued by Mr. Desai on behalf of the appellant that the
High Court has misconstrued the contents of Exs. A and B in holding that the 3rd
defendant has undertaken the liability as a co-obligant. It was submitted that there
was an integrated transaction constituted by the various documents--- Exs. A, B and
G executed between the parties on the same day and the legal effect of the documents
was to confer on the 3rd defendant the status of a surety and not of a co-obligant. In
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 35C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
our opinion, the argument put forward on behalf of the appellant is well-rounded and
must be accepted as correct. It is true that in the promissory note--Ex. B all the three
defendants have "jointly and severally promised to pay the Central Bank of India Ltd.
or order a sum of Rs. 4 lakhs only together with interest on such sum from this date",
but the transaction between the parties is contained not merely in the promissory
note--Ex. B--but also in the letter of continuity dated November 26, 1946--Ex. A
which was sent by the defendants to the plaintiff-bank along with promissory
note--Ex. B on the same date. There is another document executed by defendant No.
1 on November 26, 1946---Ex. G-Hypothecation agreement. The principle is well-
established that if the transaction is contained in more than one document between
the same parties they must be read and interpreted together and they have the same
legal effect for all purposes as if they are one document. In Manks v. Whiteley,(1)
Moulton, L.J. stated:
"Where several deeds form part of one transaction and are contemporaneously
executed they have the same effect for all purposes such as are relevant to this case as
if they were one deed. Each is executed on the faith of all the others being executed
also and is intended to speak only as part of the one transaction, and if one is seeking
to make equities apply to the parties they must be equities arising out of the
transaction as a whole."
34. It was contended that irrevocable power of attorney had been registered wherein power to sell
the property as owners to third parties had been given to the developers and thus, it partakes the
colour of contract under Section 202 of Indian Contract Act, 1872. Therefore, termination of agency
in the present case could not be effected by the transferor in view of Section 202 of the Indian
Contract Act, 1872 which is in the following terms:-
"202. Termination of agency, where agent has an interest in subject-matter.--Where
the agent has himself an interest in the property which forms the subject-matter of
the agency, the agency cannot, in the absence of an express contract, be terminated to
the prejudice of such interest."
Illustrations
(a) A gives authority to B to sell A's land, and to pay himself, out of the proceeds, the debts due to
him from A. A cannot revoke this authority, nor can it be terminated by his insanity or death. "(a) A
gives authority to B to sell A's land, and to pay himself, out of the proceeds, the debts due to him
from A. A cannot revoke this authority, nor can it be terminated by his insanity or death."
(b) A consigns 1,000 bales of cotton to B, who has made advances to him on such cotton, and desires
B to sell the cotton, and to repay himself out of the price the amount of his own advances. A cannot
revoke this authority, nor is it terminated by his insanity or death. "(b) A consigns 1,000 bales of

it terminated by his insanity or death."
To buttress her submissions, support was gathered from following observations in the judgment
rendered by Delhi High Court in Harbans Singh vs. Shanti Devi, 1977(13) DLT 369:-
"(7) For the purposes of the Law of Contract, therefore, it would not be useful to
restrict the meaning of the word "interest" by the narrow compass in which this
world is used at times in relation to immovable property. For instance, the last
sentence of section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act states that a contract for sale of
itself does not create any interest in or charge on immovable property. Similarly,
section GURBAX SINGH 17(1)(b) of the Registration Act makes only those
documents compulsorily registerable which create, declare, assign, limit or
extinguish any right, title or interest, whether vested or contingent, of the value of
one hundred rupees and upwards to or in immovable property. Since an agreement
for sale does not create such a right, title or interest, it may not be compulsorily
registerable. But in the context of the Contract Act, it cannot be said that a person
who is the beneficiary of an agreement of sale has no right or interest in the subject-
matter of the sale. He has a legally enforceable right and interest in enforcing the contract of sale by
the execution of a sale deed and in getting possession of the property agreed to be sold under the
provisions of the Specific Relief Act. In the English Common Law, the specific performance of
contracts was a part of the law of contract. This is why Chapter Iv of the Contract Act deals with the
performance of contracts which includes the performance of contracts relating to immovable
property also. In fact, section 4 of the Transfer of Property Act says that the chapters and sections of
that Act which relate to contracts shall be taken as part of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Therefore,
the respondent in whose favor the appellant had executed an agreement for the sale of an
immovable property had an interest in the subject-matter of the contract, namely, the shop, turn the
purposes of section 202 of the Contract Act if not for the purposes of the Transfer of Property and
the Registration Acts."
35. Principle of law enunciated in Haydon's case was pressed into service to urge that while
interpreting a statute, the mischief and the defect which was sought to be removed by the
enactment, full meaning should be assigned to it and such construction is required to be put as shall
suppress the mischief. It was strongly put forward that the JDA executed on 25.2.2007 followed by
registered special power of attorney dated 26.2.2007 when read together supported the view of the
revenue that provisions of Section 53A of 1882 Act stood fulfilled and as a necessary corollary
transaction was exigible to capital gains tax under Section 2(47)(v) read with Section 45 of the Act in
the hands of the assessee-appellant. The following observations recorded by the Apex Court in
Bengal Immunity Co. Limited vs. State of Bihar and others, 1955(2) SCR 603 were referred:-
"It is a sound rule of construction of a statute firmly established in England as far
back as 1584 when Heydon's case(1) was decided that-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 37C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
".................... for the sure and true interpretation of all Statutes in general (be they
penal or beneficial, restrictive or enlarging of the common law) four things are to be
discerned and considered:-
1st. What was the common law before the making of the Act., 2nd. What was the
mischief and defect for which the common law did not provide., 3rd. What remedy
the Parliament hath resolved and appointed to cure the disease of the
Commonwealth., and (1) 3 Co. Rep. 7a; 76 ElR. 637, 6334th. The true reason of the
remedy; and then the office of all the judges is always to make such construction as
shall suppress the mischief, and advance the remedy, and to suppress subtle
inventions and evasions for continuance of the mischief, and pro privato commodo,
and to add force and life to the cure and remedy, according to the true intent of the
makers of the Act, pro bono publico".
In In re Mayfair Property Company(1) Lindley, M.R. in 1898 found the rule "as necessary now as it
was when Lord Coke reported Heydon's case". In Eastman Photographic Material Company v.
Comptroller General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks(2) Earl of Halsbury re-affirmed the rule
as follows: "My Lords,, it appears to me that to construe the Statute in question, it is not only
legitimate but highly convenient to refer both to the former Act and to the ascertained evils to which
the former Act had given rise, and to the later Act which provided the remedy' These three being
compared I cannot doubt the conclusion".
36. Reliance was placed on the conclusion of the Apex Court in Dr. Baliram Waman Hiray vs. Mr.
Justice B.Lentin and another, (1988) 176 ITR 1, wherein following the Bengal Immunity's case
(supra), it was observed as under:-
"No rule is more firmly established than the principles enunciated in Heydon's case.
which have been continually cited with approval not only by the English Courts but
also by the Privy Council as well as this Court. The principles laid down in Heydon's
case have been enunciated in Craies on Statute Law, 6th edn. at p. 96 as follows:
"That for the sure and true interpretation of all statutes in general (be they penal or
beneficial restrictive or enlarging of the common law), four things are to be discerned
and considered: (1) what was the common law before the making of the Act (2) What
was the mischief and defect for which the common law did not provide (3) What
remedy the Parliament hath resolved and appointed to cure the disease of the
commonwealth (4) The true reason of the remedy. And then the office of all the
judges is always to make such construction as shall suppress the mischief and
advance the remedy, and to suppress subtle inventions and evasions for the
continuance of the mischief and pro privato commodo, and to add force and life to
the cure and remedy according to the true intent of the makers of the Act pro bono
publico."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 38C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
These rules are still in full force and effect, with the addition that regard must now be had not only
to the existing law but also to prior legislation and to the judicial interpretation thereof. The Court
applied the rule in Heydon's case in The Bengal Immunity Company Limited v. The State of Bihar &
Ors., [1955] 2 SCR 603 in the construction of Art. 286 of the Constitution."
37. The claim of the assessee was also contested relying upon judgment in Suraj Lamp and
Industries Private Limited's case (supra) by urging that while interpreting Sections 54, 55, 53-A of
the 1882 Act, the Apex Court held that transfer of immovable property by way of sale can only be by
a deed of conveyance (sale deed). In the absence of a deed of conveyance duly stamped and
registered as required by law, no right, title or interest in an immovable property can be transferred.
Any contract of sale which is not a registered deed of conveyance would fall short of the
requirements of Sections 54 and 55 of the 1882 Act and will not confer any title nor transfer any
interest in an immovable property except to the limited right granted under section 53-A of the
1882. The following observations were referred to:-
"24. We therefore reiterate that immovable property can be legally and lawfully
transferred/conveyed only by a registered deed of conveyance. Transactions of the
nature of `GPA sales' or `SA/GPA/WILL transfers' do not convey title and do not
amount to transfer, nor can they be recognized as valid mode of transfer of
immoveable property. The courts will not treat such transactions as completed or
concluded transfers or as conveyances as they neither convey title nor create any
interest in an immovable property. They cannot be recognized as deeds of title,
except to the limited extent of section 53A of the TP Act. Such transactions cannot be
relied upon or made the basis for mutations in Municipal or Revenue Records. What
is stated above will apply not only to deeds of conveyance in regard to freehold
property but also to transfer of leasehold property. A lease can be validly transferred
only under a registered Assignment of Lease. It is time that an end is put to the
pernicious practice of SA/GPA/WILL transactions known as GPA sales.
Xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx x
26. We have merely drawn attention to and reiterated the well- settled legal position
that SA/GPA/WILL transactions are not `transfers' or `sales' and that such
transactions cannot be treated as completed transfers or conveyances. They can
continue to be treated as existing agreement of sale. Nothing prevents affected parties
from getting registered Deeds of Conveyance to complete their title. The said
`SA/GPA/WILL transactions' may also be used to obtain specific performance or to
defend possession under section 53A of TP Act. If they are entered before this day,
they may be relied upon to apply for regularization of allotments/leases by
Development Authorities. We make it clear that if the documents relating to
SA/GPA/WILL transactions' has been accepted acted upon by DDA or other
developmental authorities or by the Municipal or revenue authorities to effect
mutation, they need not be disturbed, merely on account of this decision.

27. We make it clear that our observations are not intended to in any way affect the
validity of sale agreements and powers of attorney executed in genuine transactions.
For example, a person may give a power of attorney to his spouse, son, daughter,
brother, sister or a relative to manage his affairs or to execute a deed of conveyance.
A person may enter into a development agreement with a land developer or builder
for developing the land either by forming plots or by constructing apartment
buildings and in that behalf execute an agreement of GURBAX SINGH sale and grant
a Power of Attorney empowering the developer to execute agreements of sale or
conveyances in regard to individual plots of land or undivided shares in the land
relating to apartments in favour of prospective purchasers. In several States, the
execution of such development agreements and powers of attorney are already
regulated by law and subjected to specific stamp duty. Our observations regarding
`SA/GPA/WILL transactions' are not intended to apply to such bonafide/genuine
transactions."
38. In so far as enunciation of legal principles in various pronouncements relied upon by learned
counsel for the revenue are concerned, they are well recognized but their applicability has to be
judged in the facts and circumstances of the present case.
39. It would be apt to notice undisputed facts as discernible from the record of the case. The
assessee is a member of Punjabi Cooperative House Building Society Limited who owned 21.2 acres
of land in Village Kansal, District Mohali. Certain members were owning plots measuring 500
square yards whereas others were holding plots of 1000 square yards. On advertisement having
been floated by the Society to develop a Group Housing Commercial project and do development as
per the municipal building bye-laws, HASH - a developer approached them with proposal for the
development of the property. HASH in turn due to paucity of funds with it for constructing the
building and/or structures entered into an agreement with THDC for the said purpose. The
Executive Committee of the society decided to appoint HASH alongwith the Joint Developer THDC
in terms of JDA. It was resolved that members of the society owning plots measuring 500 square
yards would receive ` 82,50,000/- each to be paid by HASH in four instalments and one flat with
super area of 2250 square feet to be constructed by THDC. The members owning plots of 1000
square yards were to receive double the amount of settlement of plot holders of 500 square yards.
For this purpose, irrevocable power of attorney was also agreed to be executed for this purpose. The
resolution of the Executive Committee was ratified in the General Body meeting held on 25.2.2007
pursuant to which tripartite JDA was executed on the same day. The possession of the owners on
land measuring 21.2 acres was recognized vide this JDA. HASH was responsible to make the
payment failing which it was the responsibility of THDC. A copy of JDA dated 25.2.2007 has been
annexed as Annexure A.2 with ITA No.200 of 2013. It may be advantageous to broadly refer to
various clauses of JDA dated 25.2.2007 and irrevocable special power of attorney dated 26.2.2007.
A plain reading of JDA dated 25.2.2007 spells out that clause 1 thereof has defined various
expressions. Clause 2 enumerates the description of the project. Clause 3 describes the obligations
of the developers for getting building plans, designs, drawings etc. sanctioned from competent
authority. Clause 4 deals with consideration whereas Clauses 5 to 8 are relating to various aspects of
project and obligations of Society and Developers. Under Clause 9 of JDA, the method of transfer of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 40C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
ownership and rights have been prescribed. Clause 10 speaks about consent given by the society to
THDC for raising finance for development and completion of project. Other clauses provide for
general provisions, disclaimer partial invalidity, formation of maintenance society for the project
after its completion, transfer of rights, notices and jurisdiction whereas termination under Clause 14
and Force Majeure under Clause 26 are also material clauses which had been strenuously referred
by the appellants. In addition to JDA dated 25.2.2007, irrevocable registered special power of
attorney dated 26.2.2007 had also been executed by the society in favour of THDC. Various relevant
clauses A, B, D and other conditions relied upon by the parties have already been reproduced in the
earlier part of the judgment.
40. Under Clause 2.1 of JDA, the possession of the property was to be handed over simultaneously
with the execution and registration of the said agreement. The JDA dated 25.2.2007 was never
registered and therefore, the presumption of delivery of possession to the developers cannot be
assumed. The delivery of title deeds would not necessarily raise presumption of delivery of
possession as these are two distinct actions. Further, the irrevocable registered special power of
attorney also records that on 26.2.2007 (i.e. the date of its execution and registration), the
possession continued to be with the members of the society. Still further, even the two sale deeds
executed between the parties on 2.3.2007 and 25.4.2007 in respect of 3.08 acres and 4.62 acres
respectively clearly stipulates that possession was delivered under the said instruments which would
show that the parties had agreed for pro-rata transfer of land. A combined reading of the various
clauses of JDA dated 25.2.2007 and irrevocable registered special power of attorney dated
26.2.2007 clearly shows that the developer was entitled to enter upon the property for the purposes
of development etc. For invoking Section 53A of 1882 Act, it was mandatory to establish that
possession in part performance of an agreement was delivered by the transferor to the transferee.
Section 53A of 1882 Act does not define any contract but relates to a particular nature of contract
where transferee is entitled to protect his possession when he has been delivered the same in part
performance of a contract. In other words, the society or its members had never parted possession
of the property though under JDA and the special power of attorney, the developer was given power
to raise finance by mortgaging the property and for the purpose of registration of the charge
thereon. If at all, it is to be held that possession was delivered to the developers then it would be as a
licencee only. The developer was authorized to amalgamate the project and in the event of
termination of JDA, provisions of Clause 6 thereof were agreed to be surviving. The environmental
clearance was the responsibility of the developer THDC/HASH out of its own sources. The Tribunal
had sought to raise presumption of delivery of possession which on the basis of preceding analysis of
factual matrix involved herein was legally not permissible. The JDA dated 25.2.2007 to be covered
under Section 53A of 1882 Act was required to be a registered instrument even for purposes of
enforcing civil law rights. Once it was embodied in Section 2(47)(v) of the Act by incorporation, all
the legal requirements of Section 53A of 1882 Act had to be complied with. In the absence of
registration of such an agreement, the same was not enforceable under general law keeping in view
the provisions of Sections 17(1A) and 49 of the 1908 Act and at the same time, the transaction would
not fall under Section 2(47)(v) of the Act.
41. Under JDA dated 25.2.2007, it was the obligation of the developers to prepare, submit and
obtain sanction of the plans, designs and drawings for construction of the project from the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 41C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
competent authority which was to be within the prescribed time. The costs for necessary approvals
were also to be borne by them. It was also the obligation of the developers to make timely payment
of the consideration in the manner set out therein which was an essence of the JDA. Additionally, it
was the responsibility of the developers to obtain requisite government and statutory approvals,
sanctions of all drawings and plans required for development of the project and also to undertake
the project within six months of the handing over of the final plans, designs and drawings to the
developer for submission of the same to the competent authority for obtaining the approval which
was to be done by HASH and THDC within the prescribed time schedule. The External development
charges, licence fee, CLU charges and any other related charges were the liability of THDC.
42. Apart from above, HASH/THDC had made payment of adjustable advance of ` 3 lakhs to the
plot holder of 500 square yards besides making payment of ` 12 lakhs and ` 18 lakhs as first and
second instalments respectively. THDC defaulted in making payment of third instalment of ` 24.75
lakhs as required under clause 4.1(iv) of the JDA. It was double the aforesaid amount for plot holder
of 1000 square yards. The project was delayed due to various subsequent developments. A Public
Interest Litigation bearing CWP No.20425 of 2010 was filed in this court where
construction/development of the project was stayed vide order dated 20th January 2011. On
26.3.2012, this Court had directed the developers to obtain additional permission under the Punjab
New Capital (Periphery) Control Act, 1952. Subsequently, in CWP No.18253 of 2009 titled 'Court on
its own motion vs. UT, Chandigarh and others, this Court vide order dated 14.5.2012 directed stay of
construction in the entire catchment area of Sukhna lake as per survey of India record including the
project under consideration. Demolition of the existing structure after 11.3.2011 was also ordered.
However, the Apex Court vide order dated 22.5.2012 granted status quo and directed that no
construction should be undertaken in the area and stayed demolition of the existing structure. The
developers who were not party in CWP No.18253 of 2009 were also impleaded therein. The Society
in the meantime issued letter dated 28.1.2011 to HASH for payment of third instalment as per clause
4.1(iv) of the JDA. Vide letter dated 4.2.2011, HASH stated that the third installment would become
due only after obtaining permission to commence construction which was still pending with the
Ministry of Environment and Forests. The High Court vide order dated 28.1.2011 had already
restrained the developers to start construction. The Society not satisfied with the stand taken by the
developers sent legal notice dated 11.5.2011 to them stating therein that time was the essence of JDA
and there was delay on their part to obtain necessary approval from the competent authority. The
society gave 30 days time to the developers to make payment of the third instalment failing which
the JDA was liable to be terminated. On failure of the developers to pay the instalment, the society
decided to terminate the JDA vide resolution dated 13.6.2011 and cancelled the special power of
attorney on 31.10.2011 which was earlier executed in favour of the developers. Thus, willingness to
perform their part of the contract was absent on the part of the developers or it could not be
performed by them which was one of the condition precedent for applying Section 53A of the 1882
Act. Under Clause 26 of the JDA dated 25.2.2007, principle of Force Majeure had been provided for,
which would be applicable with full vigour in the circumstances noticed earlier. However, the
Haydon's rule, in the facts as narrated hereinbefore, would not be attracted.
43. In view of preceding analysis, it is reiterated that from the cumulative effect of covenants
contained in JDA dated 25.2.2007 read with registered special power of attorney dated 26.2.2007, it
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 42C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
cannot be held that the mandatory requirements of Section 53A of 1882 Act were complied with
which stood incorporated in Section 2(47) (v) of the Act. Once that was so, it could not be said that
the assessee-appellants were liable to capital gains tax in respect of remaining land which was not
transferred by them to the developer/builder because of supervening event not on account of any
volition on their part.
44. Viewed from another angle, it cannot be said that any income chargeable to capital gains tax in
respect of remaining land had accrued or arisen to the appellant-assessee in the facts of the case.
Considering the issue of taxability of income with regard to its accrual or receipt as the basis for
charging income tax, the Apex Court in Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay City vs. Messrs
Shoorji Vallabhdas & Co. (1962) 46 ITR 144 (SC) observed that income tax is a levy on income and
where no income results either under accrual system or on the basis of receipt, no income tax is
exigible. The relevant observations read thus:-
"Income tax is a levy on income. No doubt, the Income-tax Act takes into account two
points of time at which the liability to tax is attracted, viz., the accrual of the income
or its receipt; but the substance of the matter is the income, if income does not result
at all, there cannot be a tax, even tough in book- GURBAX SINGH keeping, an entry
is made about a " hypothetical income "
which does not materialize. Where income has, in fact, been received and is subsequently given up
in such circumstances that it remains the income of the recipient, even though given up, the tax may
be payable. Where, however, the income can be said not to have resulted at all, there is obviously
neither accrual nor receipt of income, even though an entry to that, effect might, incineration
circumstances, have been made in the books of account."
This pronouncement was applied by the Supreme Court in Godhra Electricity Co. Limited vs. CIT,
(1997) 225 ITR 746 (SC) and followed by the Calcutta High Court in CIT vs. Balarampur
Commercial Enterprises Limited, (2003) 262 ITR 439 (Cal.).
45. Relying upon decision in Messrs Shoorji Vallabhdas & Co.'s case (supra), the Supreme Court in
CIT vs. Excel Industries Limited (2013) 358 ITR 295 (SC) held that income tax cannot be levied on
hypothetical income. Income accrues when it becomes due but it must also be accompanied by a
corresponding liability of the other party to pay the amount. Only then can it be said that for the
purposes of taxability, the income is not hypothetical and it has really accrued to the assessee. It was
observed as under:-
"17. First of all, it is now well settled that income tax cannot be levied on hypothetical
income. In Commissioner of Income Tax v. Shoorji Vallabhdas and Co., [1962] 46
ITR 144 (SC) it was held as follows:-
"Income-tax is a levy on income. No doubt, the Income- tax Act takes into account
two points of time at which the liability to tax is attracted, viz., the accrual of the
income or its receipt; but the substance of the matter is the income. If income does
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187154176/ 43C.S. Atwal vs Commissioner Of Income Tax Ludhiana And ... on 22 July, 2015
not result at all, there cannot be a tax, even though in book-keeping, an entry is made
about a 'hypothetical income', which does not materialise. Where income has, in fact,
been received and is subsequently given up in such circumstances that it remains the
income of the recipient, even though given up, the tax may be payable. Where,
however, the income can be said not to have resulted at all, there is obviously neither
accrual nor receipt of income, even though an entry to that effect might, in certain
circumstances, have been made in the books of account."
18. The above passage was cited with approval in Morvi Industries Ltd. v. Commissioner of
Income-Tax (Central), [1971] 82 ITR 835 (SC) in which this Court also considered the dictionary
meaning of the word "accrue" and held that income can be said to accrue when it becomes due. It
was then observed that:
"........ the date of payment ....... does not affect the accrual of income. The moment
the income accrues, the assessee gets vested with the right to claim that amount even
though it may not be immediately."
19. This Court further held, and in our opinion more importantly, that income accrues when there
"arises a corresponding liability of the other party from whom the income becomes due to pay that
amount."
20. It follows from these decisions that income accrues when it becomes due but it must also be
accompanied by a corresponding liability of the other party to pay the amount. Only then can it be
said that for the purposes of taxability that the income is not hypothetical and it has really accrued
to the assessee."
46. We summarize our conclusions as under:-
1. Perusal of the JDA dated 25.2.2007 read with sale deeds GURBAX SINGH dated
2.3.007 and 25.4.2007 in respect of 3.08 acres and 4.62 acres respectively would
reveal that the parties had agreed for pro-rata transfer of land.
2. No possession had been given by the transferor to the transferee of the entire land
in part performance of JDA dated 25.2.2007 so as to fall within the domain of Section
53A of 1882 Act.
3. The possession delivered, if at all, was as a licencee for the development of the
property and not in the capacity of a transferee.
4. Further Section 53A of 1882 Act, by incorporation, stood embodied in section
2(47)(v) of the Act and all the essential ingredients of Section 53A of 1882 Act were
required to be fulfilled. In the absence of registration of JDA dated 25.2.2007 having
been executed after 24.9.2001, the agreement does not fall under Section 53A of 1882
Act and consequently Section 2(47)(v) of the Act does not apply.

5. It was submitted by learned counsel for the assessee-
appellant that whatever amount was received from the developer, capital gains tax has already been
paid on that and sale deeds have also been executed. In view of cancellation of JDA dated 25.2.2007,
no further amount has been received and no action thereon has been taken. It was urged that as and
when any amount is received, capital gains tax shall be discharged thereon in accordance with law.
In view of the aforesaid stand, while disposing of the appeals, we observe that the assessee
appellants shall remain bound by their said stand.
6. The issue of exigibility to capital gains tax having been decided in favour of the assessee, the
question of exemption under Section 54F of the Act would not survive any longer and has been
rendered academic.
7. The Tribunal and the authorities below were not right in holding the assessee-appellant to be
liable to capital gains tax in respect of remaining land measuring 13.5 acres for which no
consideration had been received and which stood cancelled and incapable of performance at present
due to various orders passed by the Supreme Court and the High Court in PILs. Therefore, the
appeals are allowed.
47. Consequently, the substantial questions of law as reproduced in the beginning of the judgment
are answered in the manner indicated hereinbefore and the appeals of the assessee are disposed of
accordingly.
