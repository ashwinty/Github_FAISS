2. Invoking extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India,
the petitioner herein has challenged the order dated 2.11.2019, whereby candidature of the
petitioner for the allotment of retail outlet dealership of petroleum products, in connection with
advertisement dated 25.11.2018, has been rejected.
3. In narrow compass the facts of the case can be drawn like this that petitioner pursuant to
advertisement dated 25.11.2018 issued by Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd, namely, respondent
no. 1, invited application for allotment of retail outlet dealership of the petroleum product in district
Chandauli for allocation at old National Highway No. 2 between Varanasi and Chandauli. The
petitioner applied vide application dated 24.12.2018 filling up online application form. Petitioner
submitted the documents in respect thereof which included the lease document relating to the land
offered by the petitioner falling in Khasra No. 154 with a dimension of 35X35 metres total
measuring to 1575 square metres.
4. The piece of land offered by the petitioner vide his application (hereinafter referred to as the Land
in question) was obtained by the petitioner under a lease agreement executed and registered on
14/15.12.2018 for a period of 29 years and 11 months by the original tenure-holder Mangla Singh
and thus, in view of the detail submitted by the petitioner, petitioner's application was entertained
in Group-I category and having been selected in the draw of lots, he became entitled for
consideration for allotment of retail outlet dealership.
5. In the meanwhile, it appears that, some complaint was made regarding offer of land by the
petitioner to be not a valid offer and consequently a notice was issued to the petitioner by the
Territory Manager Retail (Varanasi) on 10.6.2019 asking him to confirm as to whether the land
offered by him was already subject matter of lease agreement between the tenure-holder Mangla
Singh and one M/S. B.S.C.- C&C- "JV" (hereinafter referred to as original lessee) executed and
registered on 20.11.2017 and was in subsistence till 19.11.2019. He was asked to submit reply within
ten days.
6. The petitioner did submit a reply explaining away that the land though formed part of the lease
agreement between tenure-holder and one original lessee but in view of surrender of land
measuring 1925 square meters by the lessee on 15.9.2018 Mangla Prasad the tenure-holder got the
right to execute a fresh lease of 1575 square meters out of the surrendered part. The petitioner
appended with his reply dated 19.5.2019 the confirmation letter.
7. Having thus, received the reply of the petitioner the Territory Manager enquired from the Deputy
Registrar, Sadar, Chandauli as to whether the second lease dated 15.12.2018 was valid in face of the
fact that there already existed a lease dated 25.5.2018 in favour of one original lessee and whether
the surrender letter amounted to a valid surrender and as to whether on the basis of such letter of
surrender a subsequent lease could have been executed. The Deputy Registrar, Chandauli in his
reply dated 28.6.2019 declined to answer the questions on the ground that the he does not enjoy any
authority under the Registration Act, 1908 to enquire into the validity of written instrument and so
far as the letter dated 15.9.2018 issued by the original leessee Satish Kumar in respect of lease deed
numbers 53077/2018 and 5282 of 2018 is concerned no legal opinion can be expressed in respect of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124606142/ 2Puneet Kumar Singh vs Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. And ... on 19 December, 2019
the legal effect of such letter.
8. It appears that on the same date i.e., 22.6.2019 the Territory Manager also enquired from the
original lessee as to whether this letter was issued by Satish Kumar and in reply to that the
authorized signatory of original lessee wrote to the Territory Manager that such letter is a valid one
to the best of his knowledge and was issued by his office.
9. It appears that considering the reply of the petitioner submitted on 19.6.2019, the reply of the
Deputy Registrar and that of Satish Kumar and having visited the site, the Land Evaluation
Committee submitted report that the land did not meet the required norms and consequently the
candidature of the petitioner was rejected vide order dated 27.7.2019.
10. The order dated 27.7.2019 came to be challenged before this Court vide Writ Petition No. 26050
of 2019 and as the order was absolutely non-speaking except referring to some report of the Land
Evaluation Committee which was not discussed in the order and similarly orders were passed by the
Corporation in some other matters challenged in a number of writ petitions filed before this Court
all were heard and decided together by common judgment dated 13.8.2019 with Writ C No. 24484 of
2019 (Ansar Ali Vs. Union of India and 2 others) quashing the order impugned including the one
dated 27.7.2019 (supra). The matter was remitted to the authority to consider afresh by supplying
copy of the reports to the respective petitioners inviting their objections and then to decide the same
by means of a reasoned and speaking order.
11. In view of the judgment of the High Court dated 13.8.2019 (supra), the respondents issued
noticed to the petitioner on 4.10.2019 inviting objection and the petitioner submitted reply on
10.10.2019. Having considered the reply of the petitioner, this time the respondent- Corporation
again rejected the candidature of the petitioner by a detailed order dated 2.11.2019 on the ground
that in view of Clause-7 of the lease deed dated 25.5.2018 and Section 111(e) and Section 111 (f) of
the Transfer of Property Act, the surrender under the letter dated 15.09.2018 would not amount to
absolute surrender and consequently the offer of a piece of land would not be one referable to
Group-I category and thus the candidature of the petitioner would be liable to be considered under
Group-III category. Thus the candidature of the petitioner as such in Group-I category came to be
rejected.
12. Assailing the order impugned now, the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the petitioner
is three fold:-
(A) The lease was validly executed and registered and no one having put it to
challenge the title and possessory rights to the extent as provided for under the lease
were intact and valid on the date offer was made, for a period of 29 years and 11
months and such being the position on the date of submission of application by the
petitioner, the offer of the petitioner was a valid offer of piece of land as defined
under Group-A category and, therefore, the respondents were not justified in
rejecting the same;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124606142/ 3Puneet Kumar Singh vs Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. And ... on 19 December, 2019
(B) The surrendered part of the lease under the letter dated 15.9.2018 (hereinafter
referred to as letter) was a valid surrender in the light of the provision contained
under Section 111 (e) and Section 111 (f) of the Transfer of Property Act, 1872
(hereinafter referred to as T.P. Act, /) and the interpretation thereof by the
respondent Corporation is errorenous in law;
(C) A mere condition prescribed under the surrender letter as " Just in case there is
some emergency space requirement for me and in case the surrender plot remain
unused by you, I may use it temporarily" would not make the surrender bad and
resultantly the subsequent lease is not invalid so as to reject the candidature of the
petitioner in Group-A I category, in other words the argument is that the surrender
letter was a valid one per provision contained in Para-7 of the lease deed dated
25.5.2018.
13. Thus advancing the above arguments further, on the argument A, learned counsel for the
petitioner has placed reliance upon Clause 4 (V) of the Guidelines as contained under the Brochure
dated 24.11.2018 framed for selection of dealers for Regular and Rural Retail Outlets (for short
Brochure). Clause-5 of the Brochure as it defines Groups I, II and III is reproduced hereinunder:
"Group 1: Applicants having suitable piece of land in the advertised location/area
either by way of ownership/ long term lease for a period of minimum 19 years 11
months or as advertised by the OMC.
Group 2: Applicants having Firm Offer for a suitable piece of land for purchase or
long term lease for a period of minimum 19 years 11 months or as advertised by the
OMC.
Group 3: Applicants who have not offered land in the application."
14. The above provision has been quoted to the extent it is necessary for the appreciation of the
argument of the petitioner referable to Group-I.
15. It is submitted by the learned counsel that since he had a valid lease agreement qua a of piece of
land with a dimension of 35 metres X 45 metres and it being not questioned either by the lessor or
by the original lessee who had surrendered that piece of land and since the lease was for a period of
29 years 11 months, a period more than required one, in favour of the petitioner to bring him within
the ambit and scope of Group-I. He submits that it is not disputed that the land fell in Khasra 154
and was part of transfer by registered document and that too by a tenure-holder, the mere complaint
by a third party would not make the offer of piece of land within Group-I category as bad. So
according to him in view of the definition of land provided under Clause 4 (V), the petitioner being
eligible candidate his application was rightly entertained and having been selected in draw of lots,
he was right in offering the land for allotment of dealership of the petroleum products under the
letter dated 7.2.2019.

16. The argument B and C since relate to the issue of surrender and part of surrender of lease rights
by the original lessee referable to Section 111 (e) and 111 (f) of the Act, 1882 and the scope of para-7
of the lease deed dated 25.5.2018 both being related to each other the legal argument is that
surrender of part of lease rights was valid and so also the subsequent lease in favour of the
petitioner. Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon various authorities of the High Court
and the Supreme Court in support of his argument. He has drawn attention of the Court to Section
111 Sub-sections (e) and (f) Act No. 87 of 1882. For the appreciation of the argument so advanced,
the two clauses are reproduced hereunder:
"(e) by express surrender; that is to say, in case the lessee yields up his interest under
the lease to the lessor, by mutual agreement between them;
(f) by implied surrender;"
17. It has been argued by learned counsel for the petitioner that a bare reading of Clauses (e) and (f)
clearly provide that the legislative intent is to acknowledge surrender of lease rights by act of specific
written document or by implied surrender to wit by consent and, therefore, he argues that since
Clause-7 of the lease deed prescribes for surrender of lease rights, entitling the lessee to take such an
action in the light of the provision as contained in Clause (e) and (f). He contends that if original
lessee had written letter, expressing relinquishment of his lease rights in respect of lease land, it
would be a valid one.
18. He has placed reliance upon paragraph-27 of the Judgment of Apex Court in the case of H.K.
Sharma v.. Ramlal (2019) 4 Supreme Court Cases 153. Paragraph-27 relied upon by the petitioner's
counsel,of the judgment is reproduced hereunder:
"27. This Court in ShanMathuradas Manganlal & Co. V Nagappa Shankarappa
Malage considerd the scope of Clauses (e) and (f) of Section 111of the TP Act and laid
down the following principle in para 19 as under: (SCC P. 665)
"19. A surrender under clauses (e) and (f) of Section 111 of Transfer of Property Act, is an yielding up
of the term of the lessee's interest to like a contract by mutual consent on the lessor's acceptance of
the act of the lessee. The lessee cannot, therefore, surrender unless the term is vested in him; and
the surrender must be to a person in whom the immediate reversion expectant on the term is vested.
Implied surrender by operation of law occurs by the creation of a new relationship, or by
relinquishment of possession. It the lessee accepts a new lease that in itself is a surrender. Surrender
can also implied from the consent of the parties or form such facts as the relinquishment of
possession by the lessee and taking over possession by the lessor. Relinquishmement of possession
operates as an implied surrender. There must be a taking of possession, not necessarily a physical
taking, but something amounting to a virtual taking of possession. Whether this has occurred is a
question of fact."
19. In support of his contention he has further relied upon the judgment of Calcutta High Court in
the Case of Abdul Majid v. Hari Charan Hlder and others 53 Ind. Cas 17 (MANU/ WB/0200/1917)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124606142/ 5Puneet Kumar Singh vs Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. And ... on 19 December, 2019
and has placed reliance on paragraphs 2 and 3, wherein concurrent view has been expressed by two
Judges. Paras 2 and 3 run as under:
" 2. It is contended on behalf f the plaintiff appellant that the surrender was not really
a surrender, but a sale, because there was consideration, the consideration being the
rent for which a decree had been obtained and accrued since the date of suit. It
appears to me that there is no reason for saying that it was not a surrender to the
landlord; no authority has been shown to us for holding that the surrender must be
by instrument registered. For these reasons this appeal must be dismissed with costs.
3. I agree. Under Section 111 of the Transfer of Property Act, a lease of Immovable
property determines, by express surrender, that is to say, by the lessee yielding up his
interest under the lease to the lessor, by mutual agreement between them. It is found
that in this case the lessee did surrender her interest by mutual agreement, and it
seems to me that it makes no difference that the mutual agreement was by reason of a
consideration that was received from the tenant by the landlord. The Transfer of
Property Act does not require a registered document in such cases and no authority
has been shown to us in support of this contention."
20. Learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn our attention on para-16 of the judgment in the
case of Elias Meyer v. Manoranjan Bagchi and others 22c WN 441 (MANU/ WB/0534/1918). Para
16 of the judgment runs as under:
"16. In this country a surrender or relinquishment does not require to be in writing
but can be inferred from the acts of the parties. This is well illustrated by the case of
Chundermani Byabhsa v. Shambu Chandra Chukerbutty [1864] W.R. 270, a decision
which has never been question in this Court."
21. Reliance has also been placed upon a judgment of Andhra Pradesh High Court in the Case of
Konijeti Venkayya and ors v. Thammana Peda Venkata Subbarao and others AIR 1957 AP 619
(MANU/ AP/ 0347/1955). Counsel for the petitioner has vehemently argued that in India lease
rights are surrendered orally also and at times even such relinquishment can be inferred from the
conduct of the parties. He has tried to distinguish the Indian legal position from English one where
the statute requires for surrender to be documented one evidencing the factum of surrender. He has
relied upon para-6, 13 and 17 of the judgment (supra) which are reproduced hereinunder:
"6. On a surrender by the lessee, a lease of immovable property comes to an end. It
has to be ascertained whether there was an actual surrender or surrender in fact by
the plaintiff of his leasehold right under Exhibit B-8 in favour of the lessor, his father.
In England it has been held that where the subject- matter of the lease is a reversion,
it is a '' a matter, lying in grant, and not in livery, and of which therefore, there could
be no valid surrender in fact otherwise than by deed." Lyon v. Reed (1844) 153 ER 118
126 (E). under Section 111(e) of the Transfer of Property Act if a lessee yields up his
interest under the lease to the lessor by mutual agreement between them, there is an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124606142/ 6Puneet Kumar Singh vs Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. And ... on 19 December, 2019
express surrender or surrender in fact. In India, a surrender may be oral and may by
inferred from the acts and conduct of the parties there being no statutory provision
like Section 3 of the English Statute of Frauds that a surrender should be evidenced
by a document in writing or like Section 3 of 8 and 9 Vic. C. 106 requiring a deed for
the purposes. See Elias. Myer V. Maoranjan 22 Cal W/N 441: (AIR 1919 Cal 694) (F)
Brojo Nath V. Maheswar 28 Cal LJ 220; (AIR 1918 Cal 233) (1) (G) Chunder Monee
Nya Busan V. Sham-buchandra Chukerbutty 1884) WR CR 270 (H) and Narasimma
V. Lakshmana ILR 13 Mad 124 126, 127 (I).
13. According to English Decisions a fresh lease accepted by a lessee during the
continuance of a prior lease operates as a surrender of the original lease because by
accepting the new lease, the lessee is a party to an act the validity of which he is, by
law, afterwards stepped from disputing and which would not be valid if the first lease
continued to exist and the lessor was not in a position to upt the lessee in possession
at the date of the new lease. The law attributed the ofrce of estappel to certain acts of
notoreity such as livery of sees in, entry, aceptance of an estate See Parke B. in (1844)
153 ER 118 127 (E) and Chitty, J. in Wallis V. Hands 1893 2 CH 75 at PP 79 and 82
(o). The grant of new lease to a stranger with the tenants' assent and change of
possession at about the time of the new lease were held to bring the case within the
scope of the doctrine of implied surrender. The insistence on delivery of possession
by the old lessee and the assumption that the lessor was in possession at the date of
the new lease and delivered possession under the new lease was due to the fact that,
in England, it was for a long time considered necessary that a lessor should be in
possession of the land intended to be leased. I twas therefore decided by the English
Courts that where a lessee assented to a lease being granted to Anr. And also gave up
possession to the new lessee there was a surrender by operation of law. Davision V.
Gent (1857) 1 H & N 744 (p), 189 & 2 CH 75 at pp 79 and 82 (o). This requirement of
the English common law that the lessor should have been in possession and given
possession to the lessee at the time of the lease was dispensed with by Section 4 (2) of
the Law of property Act, 1925, but it influenced the course of decision In England.
Another consideration which weighed with the English Courts in holding that an
assent by the tenant to the new lease would not amount to a surrender by operation
of law without actual delivery of possession to the new tenant was adverted to by
Chitty,J., in 1893 2 CH 75 PP. 79 and 82 (o), in these terms:
To hold that mere oral assent to new lease operates as surrender in law would be a'
most dangerous doctrine; it would practically amount to a repeal of the Statute of
frauds and would let in all the mischief against which the statute is intended to
guard; the policy of that statute is carried still further by the Statute 8 and 9 Vic.
C.106, Section 3 which requires a deed in cases where formerly a mere writing would
have sufficed.
17. It was argued for the Respondent that even if Exhibits B-8 and B-12 were
inconsistent or in compatible, the operation of Exhibit B-8 would remain suspended
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124606142/ 7Puneet Kumar Singh vs Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. And ... on 19 December, 2019
only during 1947-1948 at the end of which the term of Exhibit B012 would expire and
that Exhibit B-8 would continue to be in force from 1948-1949 onwards till
1962-1963 according to its tenor. Reliance was placed on the following observation of
Ramesam J in (MANU/ TN/ 0049/292: ILR 48 Mad 815, 819 AIR 1925 Mad 127,
1278 ) (N).
22. Then again, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that in the case of Jamuna Oil Mills v.
The AddI. District Judge and others 1978 AWC 413 All (MANU/UP/ 0547/1978). Paragraphs 34 and
35 run as under:
"34. To begin with it, it will be proper to give in brief the requirements of express or
implied surrender of tenancy rights. Section 111 of the Transfer of Property Act lays
down, amongst others, that a tenant can surrender his or her rights expressly or
impliedly. Woodfall in his book on '' Landlor and Tenant', 27th ED. P. 362 says that
"an implied surrender can also be by the conduct of both the parties" He writes "the
term surrender by operation of law or implied surrender (there being no distinction
is the expression used to describe all those cases where the law implies surrender
from unequivocal conduct of both parties which is inconsistent with the continuance
of the existing tenancy;
35. In Amar Krishna v. Nazir Hasan AIR 1939 Oudh 257 at page 267 it was observed:
An implied surrender takes place either by the creation of new relationship between
the lesor and the lessee such as the acceptance of a new lease which must operate as
implied surrender of the old one or in other ways based on the consent of the parties
or by the relinquishment of possession by the lessee and taking over possession by
the lessor which would lead to the inference of an implied surrender of the lease."
23. Placing reliance upon another judgment in the case of T.K. Lathika v. Karsandas Jamandas AIR
1995 SC 3335, (MANU/SC/0535/1999). Learned counsel for the petitioner has placed emphasis on
paragraphs 11,12,13, and 15 which are reproduced hereunder:
"11. The principle which governs the doctrine of implied surrender of a lease is that
when certain relationship exist between two parties in respect of a subject matter and
a new relationship has come into existence regarding the same subject matter, the
two sets cannot co-exist, being inconsistent and incompatible between each other, i.e.
if the latter can come into effect only on termination of the former, then it would be
deemed to have been terminated in order to enable the latter to operate. A mere
alteration or improvement or even impairment of the former relationship would not
ipso facto amount to implied surrender. It has to be ascertained on the terms of the
new relationship vis- a-vis the erstwhile demise and then judge whether there was
termination of the old jural relationship by implication.

12. The following passage in the Halsbury's Law of England, 4th Edn. Vol 27 at page
355, is apposite:
449. Surrender by change in nature of tenant's occupation. A surrender is implied
when the tenant remains in occupation of the premises in a capacity inconsistent
with his being tenant, where, for instance, be becomes the landlord's employee, or
where the parties agree that the tenant is in future to occupy the premises rent free
for life as a license. An agreement by the tenant to purchase the reversion does not
itself effect a surrender, as the purchase is conditional on a good title being made by
landlord.
13. In Hill and Redman' s Law of Landlord and Tenant (16th Edn.) at page 451 it is
observed that " a surrender does not follow from a mere agreement made during the
tenancy for the reduction or increase of rent, or other variation of its terms, unless
there is some special reasons to infer a new tenancy, where, for instance , the parties
make change in the rent under the belief that the old tenancy is at an end.
15. In Krishna Kumar Khemka V. Grindlays Bank MANU/SC/0200/1991: [1990] 2
SCR 961 a two- judge Bench of this Court held thus:
Surrender of a part doe not amount to implied surrender of the entire tenancy and
the rest of the tenancy remains untouched....
Likewise the mere increase or reduction of rend also will not necessarily import a
surrender of an existing lease and the creation of anew tenancy"
24. Justifying the part of surrender of land as legally sustainable and accordingly defending letter
dated 15.9.2018 and consequently subsequent lease deed dated 14/15.12.2018, learned counsel for
the petitioner has cited the Supreme Court Judgment in the Case of Krishna Kumar Khemka v.
Grindlays Bank P.L.C. and others (1990) 3 Supreme Court Cases 669 where the Apex Court vide
paragraphs 8 and 9 has held thus:
"8. Learned counsel for the respondents, on the other hand, submitted that there was
no new tenancy and surrender of flat Nos. 1 and 2 by the Grindlays and retaining two
more flats does not amount to a new tenancy at least so far as Grindlays is concerned
and a reduction of rend also does not create new tenancy inasmuch as the rent is that
they had to pay was only for two flats in respect of each (sic which) their tenancy
continue.
9. In Woodfall's Law of Landlord and Tenant, (25th edn., p. 969 paragraph 2079
reads as under:
"2079. Implied surrender of part only. If a lessee for yeas accepts a new lease by
indenture of part of the lands, it is a surrender for that part only, and not for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124606142/ 9Puneet Kumar Singh vs Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. And ... on 19 December, 2019
whole; and though a contract for years cannot be so divided, as to be avoided for part
of the years and to subsist for the residue, either by act of the party or act in law; yet
the land itself may be divided, and the tenant may surrender one or two acres, either
expressly or by act of law, any the lease for the residue will stand good and
untouched."
In Halsbury's Law of England(4th end., Volume 27) paragraph 449 reads and under:
"449. Surrender by change in nature of tenant's occupation. A surrender is implied
when the tenant remains in occupation of the premises in a capacity inconsistent
with his being tenant, where, for instance, he becomes the landlord's employee, or
where the parties agree that the tenant is in future to occupy the premises rent free
for life as a licensee. An agreement by the tenant to purchase the reversion does not
of itself effect a surrender, as the purchase is conditional does not itself being made
by the landlord."
In Foa's General Law of Landlord and Tenant (7th edn. ) by Judge Forbes, paragraph991 reads thus:
91. Lease of part- It has been held that acceptance of a new lease of part only of the
demised premises operates as a surrender of that part and no more; but any
arrangement between landlord and tenant which operates as a fresh demise wil work
a surrender of the old tenancy, and this may result from an agreement under which
the tenant gives up part of the premies and pays a diminish rent for the remainder-
and it may result from the mere alteration in the amount of rent payable. Where one
only of two or more lessees accepts a new lease, it is a surrender only of his share."
In Hill and Redman's Law of Lanlord and Tenant (16th edn. On page 451 ) it is observed:
"Any arrangement between the landlord and tenant which operates as a fresh demise
will work a surrender of the old tenancy and this may result from an agreement
under which the tenant gives up part of the premises and pays a diminished rent for
the remainder, provided a substantial difference is thereby made in the condition of
the tenancy. But a surrender does not follow from a mere agreement made during the
tenancy for the reduction or increase of rent, or other variation of its terms, unless
there is some special reason to infer a new tenancy, where, for instance, the parties
make the change in the rent in the belief that the old tenancy is at an end."
From the above passages it can be inferred that surrender of a part does not amount to implied
surrender of the entire tenancy and the rest of the tenancy remains untouched. We shall now
examine the cases cited. In Konijeti Venkayya V. Thammana Peda Venkata Subbaro Viswanatha
Sastri,J.referred to the abovementioned passage from Woodfall's Law of Landlord and tenant and
observed that the principle of law is stated correctly."

25. Finally defending the lease deed executed in favour of the petitioner by the original tenure
holder, learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the
Case of ITC Ltd v. State of U.P. (2011) 7 Supreme Court Cases 493 wherein it has been held that
unless and until a duly executed and registered lease deed is questioned and canceled by competent
court of law, it will have all legal effects and can not by itself amount to be bad by any unilateral
action even at the end of lessor. Learned counsel has placed reliance upon legal position held by the
Supreme Court in paragraph 30 of the said judgment which runs as under:
"30. A lease governed exclusively by the provisions of the Transfer of property Act,
1882 ("the TP Act, for short) could be canceled only by filling a civil suit for its
cancellation or for a declaration that it is illegal, null and void and for the
consequential relief of delivery back possession. Unless and until a court of
competent jurisdiction grants such a decree, the lease will continue to be effective
and binding. Unilateral cancellation of a registered lease deed by the lessor will
neither terminate the lease nor entitle the lessor to seek possession. This is the
position under private law. But where the grant of lease is governed by a statute or
statutory regulations, and if such statute expressly reserves the power of cancellation
or revocation to the lessor, it will be permissible for an authority, as the lessor, to
cancel a duly executed and registered lease deed, even if possession has been
delivered, on the specific grounds of cancellation provided in the statute."
26. A careful reading of the aforesaid citation reveals that even the lessor does not have the right to
unilaterally terminate the lease and seek possession so long as the existing rights the lease has not
been surrendered by the lessee. The lessor would not get any right out of his action except in those
cases where the statutory regulation reserves the right of cancellation or revocation in favour of the
lessor. So it is a statutory authority which enjoys the right to cancel the lease even unilaterally in
cases where possession has been delivered to the lessee, provided of course, where grounds for
cancellation are part of terms and condition of the lease.
27. Learned counsel for the petitioner has urged that in the present case, it is just a complaint by
complainant a third party, and neither lessor nor, the original lessee who had surrendered part of
the lease land making way for a subsequent lease in favour of the petitioner, has questioned the
subsequent lease. The factual position of surrender followed by subsequent lease has created
indefeasible rights favour of the petitioner and would not automatically get rendered as bad so as to
reject his candidature on that count. He argues, therefore, the piece of land so long as it is a subject
matter of a valid conveyance, until, of course cancelled or set aside or declared non est or bad by a
competent court of law, the authorities were not justified in holding that the lease itself was bad.
28. On the question of condition being led in the surrender letter on right to re-entry in case of
emergency or in case of non use of land, it is argued that this right stood extinguished the moment a
subsequent lease got executed by the lessor. He submits that the execution of the subsequent lease,
the petitioner being lessee herein entered into possession and the contingency as stipulated in the
letter of surrender stood evaporated. It is further submitted that the lessee of the original lease had a
contract of transfer in his favour from the original lessor and any terms and condition would be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124606142/ 11Puneet Kumar Singh vs Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. And ... on 19 December, 2019
intra party on the principle of privity of contract between the two and it is admitted to the original
lessee and the lessor and it has not been doubted at all even by the Corporation that the original
lessee prior to the execution of subsequent lease on 15.12.2018 did not re-enter the land and so,
those conditions would not be any more binding either upon the lessor or upon the petitioner and to
the limited extent described under the lease agreement the rights, title have flown in favour of the
petitioner from the lease agreement and the rights and interest of the original lessor have even got
extinguished qua the land and the land has to be taken as a clean land free from all encumbrances to
be taken within the definition of land under Clause 4 (V) of the Brochure as of Group-I category.
29. He submits that the complaint was absolutely baseless and the Corporation was not justified in
questioning the lease deed and, therefore, he submits that the order impugned is not sustainable in
the eyes of law and is liable to be quashed.
30. Per contra the argument advanced by the learned counsel for the respondent Corporation Sri
Vikas Budhwar is that in view of the provision contained under the Registration Act which came into
force in the year 1908, the legal position prior to the said order would not be applicable. In the
present case according to him, a document that conveys transfer of immovable property is
necessarily required to be registered under Section 17 of the said Act failing which the document is
inadmissible in law and a document which is inadmissible in law cannot create any right or title in
the eyes of law and thus the argument is that letter of surrender dated 15.9.2018 cannot be a valid
surrender within the meaning and scope of the provisions of Transfer of Property Act,1882 read
with relevant provision of registration under the Indian Registration Act, 1908.
31. The second argument advanced by the learned counsel for the respondent is that Clause-7 of the
lease agreement does not talk of part surrender of lease and since the original lessee pursuant to the
lease agreement dated 25.5.2018 was bound by the terms and conditions contained therein, he was
not justified in surrendering lease rights in respect of the part of the property in variation to the
conditions prescribed under the lease agreement and if at all it could have been, it ought to have
been a registered one.
32. The third argument advanced by learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Corporation is that
it is well within the rights of the Corporation to determine whether a land is suitable or not for the
purposes of setting up retail outlet of the petroleum products. He submits that though dealership
offer by the respondent Corporation is on the basis of owned dealership retail outlets, in the present
case, but the Corporation would be the best judge to determine that a particular land is a suitable
land for the purposes of investment. He submits that investment is long drawn one and, therefore, it
has to be secured one. He submits that merely because the land is as per the measurement and
located at the site itself would not make it suitable in every sense of word, meaning thereby, he
argues, if the document qua land creates an impression of any likelihood of civil litigation relating to
rights and title of the land property, the Corporation would be justified in not treating such land to
be suitable land. Thus according to him merely because lessor and the original lessee have not
questioned the title, it would hardly matter as in case if the documents relating to the lease or title of
land are such that may make it questionable in court of law at an future point of time resulting in a
long drawn civil litigation.

33. It is argued that the Corporation, may be a public sector Corporation, but if it is dong business
then it is the best judge to ensure its business prospects. Merely because an advertisement has been
issued inviting application and one is selected in draw of lots, would not create any indefeasible
right in his favor to claim for allotment of dealership as a rule.
34. On the legal point raised by Sri Vikas Budhwar that if a lease deed is executed and it's
surrendered is sought and the surrender of rights is in part of the lease property, it cannot be as part
relinquishment is not contemplated either under the original lease agreement or under Section 111
of T.P. Act 1882 and if at all it is done, it is in variation to the clause of lease agreement and so it is
required to be registered. Sri Budhwar has drawn attention of the Court towards Clause-7 of the
original lease deed dated 25.5.2018 executed by the tenure holder Mangal Singh in favour of Ms.
B.S.C.- C&C-JV. Clause-7 of the original lease deed dated 25.5.2018 is reproduced herein under:
"7. That the lessee shall be at liberty to vacate to determine this agreement by giving
notice of two months in writing to the lessor expiring at any time during the currency
of this period."
35. A bare reading of the Clause 7 clearly reveals that lessee shall be at liberty to vacate to determine
this agreement by giving notices of two months in writing to the lessor during the currency of the
lease period. It is argued that it talks of whole surrender of the lease as it refers to determination of
the lease itself. Sri Budhwar has also taken us to Clause-8 of the lease deed which runs as under:
"8. That if lessee become unable to complain the above terms and condition the
lessor will able to compensate his loss from the lessee company property situated at
the above plot (land)"
36. Clause-8 of the lease shows that the lease has been executed on the terms and conditions is
styled as such "hereinafter mentioned which is ageed by the parties as follows" shows that the terms
and condition bound the lessee to act in the manner in which they are provided. He argues that
since the lease did not provide for the part surrender of the land, the surrender letter dated 15.92011
would not amount to a lawful surrender.
37. Advancing the argument further he submits that under Section 111(e) what is contemplated is
the surrender of the entire interest under the lease. He has relied upon paragraph-10 of the
judgment in the case of Tirath Ram Gupta v. Gurubachan Singh and another AIR 1987 Supreme
Court 770 which runs as under:
"The lessee has a right to transfer by sub-lease even a part of his interest in the
property as provided in Section 108(j) of the Transfer of Property Act. A transferee
from the lessee has a right to claim the benefit of contract to the lessee's interest,
vis-a-vis the landlord, (vide Section 108 second paragraph of clause (c) of the
Transfer of Property Act) Thus a sub-lessee who has obtained a part of the interest of
the head tenant will be entitled to claim the benefit of the contract vis-a-vis the
lessor, as the lessee (head tenant) cannot surrender the lease in part. Section 111(e)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124606142/ 13Puneet Kumar Singh vs Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. And ... on 19 December, 2019
contemplates a surrender of the entire inter- est under the lease and not a part of the
interest alone. Moreover, a lease can be determined only by restoring pos- session in
respect of the entire property which was taken on lease (see Section 108(m). Section
115 of the Transfer of Property Act provides that the surrender of a lease does not
prejudice an under-lease of the property or in part thereof previously granted by the
lessee. The lessee, having parted with a part of the interest in the property in favour
of the sub-lessee, cannot surrender that part of the property which is in the
possession of the sub-lessee for he cannot restore possession of the same to the lessor
apart from the fact the he can terminate the contract of lease only as a whole and not
in respect of a part of it. Having regard to all these factors, even without going into
the question of the partial surrender of lease being vitiated by collusion, it is not open
to the appellant in law to contend that the second respondent is entitled to and had
validly surrendered a portion of the lease-hold property and the first respondent,
being the sub-tenant is bound by the surrender and should deliver possession."
38. He further argues that mere act or conduct of the party whether in writing or otherwise would
not amount to determination of lease unless such intention to surrender in the existing lease is
incorporated in writing any subsequent agreement is acknowledgment of the consent of the lessee in
that regard. He therefore, seeks to urge that a surrender has to be in writing and that has to be a
registered one and it should be in respect of entire property. He has placed reliance upon the
Judgment of Supreme Court in the Case of H.K. Sharma Vs. Ram Lal (2019) 4 Supreme Court Cases
153 in which vide paragraphs 23 to 35 the Court has held thus:
"23. in other words, the question that arises for consideration is when the lessor
enters into an agreement to sell the tenanted property to his lessee during the
subsistence of the lease, whether execution of such agreement would ipso facto result
in determination of the lease and sever the relationship of lessor and the lessee in
relation to the leased property.
24. In our considered opinion, the aforementioned question has to be decided
keeping in view the provisions of Section 111 of the TP Act and the intention of the
parties to the lease- whether the parties intended to surrender the lease on execution
of such agreement in relation to the tenanted premises or they intended to keep the
lease subsisting notwithstanding the execution of such agreement.
25. Chapter V of the TP Act deals with the leases of immo0valble property. This
chapter consists of Section 105 to Section 117.
26. A lease of an immovable property is a contract between the lessor and the lessee.
Their rights are governed by Sections 105 to 117 of the TP Act read with the respective
State rent laws enacted by the State. Section 111 of the T Act deals with the
determination of lease. Clauses (a) to (h) set out the grounds on which a lease of an
immovable property can be determined. Clauses (e) and (f) with which we are
concerned here provide that a lease can be determined by an express surrender; in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124606142/ 14Puneet Kumar Singh vs Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. And ... on 19 December, 2019
case, the lessee yields up his interest under the lease to the lessor by mutual
agreement between them whereas clause (f) provides that the lease can be
determined by implied surrender.
27. This Court in Shah Mathuradas Manganlal & Co. V. Nagappa Shankarappa
Malage considered the scope of clauses (e) and (f) of Section 111 of he TP Act and laid
down the following principles in para 19 as under: (SCC p. 665) "19. A surrender
under clauses (e) and (f) of Section 111 of Transfer of Property Act, is an yielding up
of the term of the lessee's interest to him who has the immediate reversion or the
lessor's interest. It takes effect like a contract by mutual consent on the lessor's
acceptance of the act of the lessee. The lessee cannot, therefore, surrender unless the
terms vested in him; and the surrender must be to a person in whom the immediate
reversion expectant on the term is vested. Implied surrender by operation of law
occurs by the creation of a new relationship, or by relinquishment of possession. It
the lessee accepts a new lease that in itself is a surrender. Surrender can also be
implied from the consent of the parties or from such facts as the relinquishment of
possession by the lessee and taking over possession by the lessor. Relinquishment of
possession operates as an inplied surrender. There must be a taking of possession,
not necessarily a physical taking, but something amounting to a virtual taking of
possession. Whether this has occurred is a question of fact."
28. It is in the light of the aforementioned legal principle, the question involved in this case has to be
examined.
29. Perusal of agreement to sell dated 13.5.1993 (Annexure P-1) shows that though the agreement
contains 9 conditions but none of the conditions provides, much less in specific terms, as to what
will be the fate of the tenancy. In other words, none of the conditions set out in the agreement dated
13.5.2003 can be construed for holding that the parties intended to surrender the tenancy rights.
30. A fortiori, the parties died not intend to surrender the tenancy rights despite entering into an
agreement of sale of the tenanted property. In other words, if the parties really intended to
surrender their tenancy rights as contemplated in clauses (e) or (f) of Section 111 of the TP Act while
entering into an agreement to sell the suit house, it would have made necessary provision to that
effect by providing a specific clause in the agreement. It was, however, not done. On the other hand,
we find that the conditions set out in the agreement do not make out a case of express surrender
under clause (e) or implied surrender under clause (f) of Section 111 of the TP Act.
31.It is for this reason, the law laid down by this court in R.Kanthimathi has no application to the
facts of this case and is therefore, distinguishblae on fact. Indeed it will be clear from mere perusal
of para 4 of the said decision quoted hereinbelow:(SCC p.341) "4. As aforesaid, the question for
consideration is , whether the status of tenant as such changes on the execution of an agreement of
sale with the landlord. It is relevant at this junction first to examine the terms of the agreement of
sale. The relevant portions of the agreement of sale recorded the following:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124606142/ 15Puneet Kumar Singh vs Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. And ... on 19 December, 2019
'I the aforesaid Mrs Bratrict Xavier hereby agree out of my own free will, to sell,
convey and transfer the property to you Mrs. R. Kanthimathi wife of Mr. S.
Ramaswami, 435 Trichy Road, Coimbatore for a mutually agreed sale consideration
of Rs. 25,000/ I shall be proceeding to Coimbatore and shall execute the sale deed
and present the same for admission and registration before the Registering
Authority, accepting and acknowledge payment of the balance of consideration of Rs.
5000 (Rupees five thousand only) at the time of registration and shall complete the
transaction for sale and conveyance as the property demised has already been
surrendered to your possession.
(emphasis in original) The words highlighted in italics of the agreement were
construed by their Lordships for holding that these italicised words in the agreement
clearly indicate that the parties had really intended to surrender their tenancy rights
on execution of the agreement of sale and bring to an end their jural relationship of
the landlord and tenant.
32. As observed supra, such is not the case here because we do not find any such
clause or a clause akin thereto in the agreement dated 13-5-1993 and nor we find that
the existing conditions in the agreement discern the intention of the parties to
surrender the tenancy agreement either expressly or impliedly.
33. In the light of the foregoing discussion, we are of he consiered opinion that the
tenancy in question between the parties did not result in its determination as
contemplated under Section 111 of the TP Act due to execution of the agreement
dated 13-5-1993 between the parties for sale of the suit house and the same remained
unaffected notwithstanding execution of the agreement dated 13-5-1993
34. A fortiori, the respondent (lessor) was rightly held entitled to file an application
against the appellant (lessee) under Section 21 (1) (a) of the U.P. Act and seek the
appellant's eviction from the suit house after determining the tenancy in question.
35. Before parting, we make it clear that we examined the terms of the agreement
dated 13-5-1993 only for deciding the question as to whether the execution of
agreement, in any manner, resulted in determination of the existing tenancy rights
between the parties in relation to the suit house in the context of the TP Act and the
U.P. Act and not beyond it."
39. On the question of agreement that varies essential terms of existing registered
lease, it must be registered one. The learned counsel for the respondent has drawn
our attention to Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act and Section 17 of
Registration Act. Which are reproduced hereunder:
"107. A lease of immovable property from year to year, or for any term exceeding one
year, or reserving a yearly rent, can be made only by a registered instrument."

executed after the 1st day of January 1872, and not conferred by a will, shall also be registered.
40. From the bare perusal of the aforesaid provision, it is urged, it is quite clear that every document
which conveys transfer of immovable property needed to be registered and unless such document is
registered, it does not at all or in anyway conveys the title may be in the limited scope of the
document so executed. Learned counsel for the respondent has placed reliance upon para-3 of the
judgment of Supreme Court in the Case of Sunil Kumar Roy v. Bhowra Kankanee Collieries Ltd. And
others AIR 1971 Supreme Court 751 which runs as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124606142/ 18Puneet Kumar Singh vs Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. And ... on 19 December, 2019
"3. Mr. B. Sen for the appellant sought to raise the question about the admissibility of
Exh. A-4 for want of registration. In the first place this contention cannot be
entertained so long as the finding of the High Court on the only point which was
canvassed before it about the reduction of the rate of royalty is not set aside. The
High Court had held after an examination of the evidence that it had not been proved
that there was any change in the market condition in July or in December 1953 to call
for a reduction in the rate of royalty or that there was any mutual lessor or the lessee
for such reduction which was to become effective from July 1952. No attempt was
made by Mr. Sen to persuade us to reverse this conclusion. Even on the assumption
that a mutual arrangement or agreement as evidenced by Exh. A-4 was arrived at
between the appellant and the Eastern Coal Co. Ltd., we are unable to agree that any
reduction in the rate of royalty could have been effected by means of Exh. A-4 which
had not been registered under the provisions of the Indian Registration Act. It is well
settled by now that a document which varies the essential terms of the existing
registered lease, such as the amount of rent, must be registered: See Durga Prasad
Singh V. Rajendera Narain Bagchi, (1910) ILR 37 Cal 293 which was approved by the
Full Bench in Lalit Mohan Ghosh v Gopal Chuck Coal Company (1912) ILR 39 Cal
294 (FB) decision of the Madras High Court in Obai Goundan v. Ramalinga Ayyar,
(1899) LIR 22 mad 217, taking a contrary view has not been followed by the High
Courts in India and the consistent view that has been taken in that registration of an
agreement is necessary which reduces the rent of an existing registered lease. See
Mulla on Indian Registration Act, 7th Edn. Pages 75-76.
41. Learned counsel for the respondents has placed reliance upon paragraphs 12 and 15 of the
Judgment of the Supreme Court in the Case of Chandrakant Shankarao Machale v. Parubhai Bahiru
Mohite (dead) (2008) 6 Supreme Court Cases 745. Paras 12 and 15 runs as under:
"12. The deed of mortgage dated 28-2-1983 was a registered document. The terms of
a registered document could be varied or altered only by another registered
document. A finding of fact has been arrived at that the appellant could not prove his
possession as a tenant. We have noticed hereinbefore that the appellant was put in
possession a a mortgagee. It was, therefore, in our opinion, impermissible in law to
change his status from a mortgagee to that of a lessee by reason of an unregistered
deed of lease (eve if we assume that the same had been executed.)
15. The deed of mortgage was a registered one. It fulfilled the conditions of a valid
mortgage. Its terms could not have been varied or altered by reason of an
unregistered document so as to change the status of the parties from mortgagee to a
lessee. [See S. Saktivel V. M Venugoal pillai (SCC p. 108, para 6: AIR paras 6-7)].
42. Counsel for the respondent has further placed emphasis upon paragraph 31 of the judgment of
the Supreme Court in the case of K.B. Saha and sons private limited v. Development Consultant
Limited (2008) 8 Supreme Court Cases 564. Para 31 runs as under:

"31. The High Court in the impugned judgement relied on a decision of the Allahabad
High Court in Ratan Lal V. Hari Shanker to hold that since the appellant wanted to
extinguish the right of the respondent with the help of the unregistered tenancy, the
same was not a collateral purpose. In Ratan lal case while discussion the meaning of
the terms " collateral purpose" the High Court had observed as follows: (AIR pp.
180-81, para 4) "4. The second contention was that the partition deed, even if it was
not resisted could certainly be looked into for a collateral purpose... but the collateral
purpose has a limited scope and meaning. It cannot be used for the purpose of saying
that the deed created or declared or assigned or limited or extinguished a right to
immovable property... term "collateral purpose' would not permit the party to
establish any of these acts from the deed."
43. Counsel for the respondent has further placed reliance upon the judgment of the Madras High
Court in the case of B. Ahmed Marcair v. Muthuvlliappa Chettiar 1961 AIR (Madras) 28 in which
vide paragraphs 7 and 8 the court held thus:
"7. In this connection the learned District Munsif has pertinently pointed out the
implications of the decision in Gopal Chandra Das v Harendra Natha datta, 63 Ind
Cas 483 (Cal). In that case the Calcutta High Cout held that though no writing was
ordinarily necessary in this country for surrendering a tenancy if the original lease is
registered the surrender of a portion of the tenancy with an abatement of rent can
only be effected by a registered instrument as in such a case the surrender involves a
variation of the original contract of tenancy. The Calcutta High Court has also held
that oral evidence as regards such surrender is inadmissible under Section 92 of the
Evidence Act. This decision has been cited with the approval in the well-known
commentaries on the Transfer of Property Act by Chitaley and Annaji Rao, Third
Edition (1950) page 1861.
8.When the facts lead to the conclusion that there was sufficient interruption,
substantial Interference - it need not be physical exposition (?) (Sic (dispossession) to
the quiet enjoyment of the lessee of the demised land unde the lessor assured to the
lessee under Section 108 C of the Transfer of Property Act what are the consequences
which flow? The Courts below have rightly relied on the decision in Dhunput Singh v.
Mohomed Kazim , ILR 24 Cal 296 and held that the lessee in this case can plead that
his obligation to pay rent or balance of rent due to the lessor be held under
suspension or must be held to have abated by reason of the conduct of the lessor. The
effect of partial eviction by a lessor has been dealt with in the following passage at
page 659 under Section 108(L) in Mulla's Transfer of Property Act Fourth Edition (by
C.J. S.R.Das) "If the premises are let for one rent, the rule of English law is that the
eviction of the lessee by the lessor from part of the demised premises suspends the
rent for the whole. The reason of the rule given in the earlier cases is that the landlord
being in feudal times the defender and protector of the tenant should not be
encouraged to disturb him. In later cases the reason given is that the landlord is not
entitled to apportion his wrong. Judicial decisions in India on this point have not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124606142/ 20Puneet Kumar Singh vs Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. And ... on 19 December, 2019
been uniform. In some cases this rule of English law has been followe and it has been
held that if the rent is an entire rent for all the property leased, eviction by the lessor
of the lessee from part of the property leased suspends the whole rent."
44. Yet another judgment in that regard relied upon by learned counsel for respondent is of Calcutta
High Court in the case of M.S. Ram Singh v. Bijoy Singh Surana AIR 1972 Calcutta 190 wherein the
Court in paras 19, 20 and 21 has held thus:
"19. Mr. Banerjee referred to the decision in Bengal Coal Co. Ltd V. Nonoranjan
Bagchi AIR 1919 Cal 694 in which it was observed that a surrender or relinquishment
does not require to be in writing but may be inferred from acts of parties. In Abdul
Majid V . Hari Charan Halder AIR 1919 Cal 840, it was held that a surrender is not
required to be by an instrument registered. The same view was taken in Sari Debi V.
Sailabala Dasi AIR 1920 Cal 858 in which it was held that even though the original
tenancy was created by the registered lease, its surrender would be valid if it is
accepted and acted upon by the landlord. But in the present case, as the surreder was
by instrument in writing it was compulsory registrable as was held in Nadig
Neelakanta Rao V. state of Mysore. AIR 1960 Mys 87. It was held that as the
instrument of surrender purports to extinsguish the rights of the tenant, valued at
over Rs. 100.- it is compulsorily registrable.
20. Mr. Ghosh disputed the contention and in his turn contended on the authorities
of this Court cited above, that as the surrender was accepted and acted upon as also
evidenced by Exs 6 and 7, no further instrument was necessary. He further contended
that surrender was not an extinguishment of interest in immovable property as
contemplated in Cl. (B) of Section 17 (1) of the said Act but as it was relinquishment
of the lessee's interest, Cl. (b) of Section 17 (1) was not attracted. Further the interest
of the original tenant was that of a monthly tenant and such tenancy does not require
registration under Cl. (d) and its surrender accordingly did not require registration.
Mr. Ghosh also contended that the EX. 7 did not by itself create declare or extinguish
any right as would appear reading the document as a whole and accordingly it came
under the exception in Cl. (b) of sub-section (2) of S.17. On that ground the decision
in Nadig Neelkanta Ra, AIR 1960 Mys 87 (supra) was sought to be distinguished.
21. As we have seen surrender is an extinguishment of the lessee's interest and there
is no dispute that value of the interest would be over Rs. 100/-. the document recites
a surrender in praesenti and even if the surrender purports to be effective on a
further date, it would make no difference on this aspect for the purposes of
registration. Clause (b) of Section 17 (1) includes all instruments which purport or
operate to create, assign, limit or extinguish whether in present or in future any right,
title or interest of value of Rs. 100/- and upwards to or in immovable property. Apart
from the surrender as evidenced by the document Ex.7 and the evidence in support
thereof there is no other pleading or evidence in support of oral surrender nor it is
dependent on any subsequent document. The document Ex. 7, as we have see,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124606142/ 21Puneet Kumar Singh vs Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. And ... on 19 December, 2019
purports to extinguish the interest of the lessee in his tenancy, and though a
surrender on a future date as contended it is an invalid surrender, for the purpose of
Section 17(1) of the Indian Registration Act the document is compulsorily registrable
and is not excepted by any of the provision of the Act.
45. Placing reliance upon the judgment of Allahabad High Court in the case of Ratan Lal and others
Vs. Hari Shanker and others AIR 1980 Allahabad 180. It is contended by the learned counsel for the
respondent that mere family arrangement cannot be itself a document to create rights in favour of
the beneficiaries which otherwise is required under law to be compulsorily registriable. Learned
counsel for the respondent has placed reliance upon paragraph -5 of the judgment which is
reproduced hereunder:
"Learned counsel then contended that the deed could be treated to be a family
arrangement was not compulsorily registrable. This was not compulsorily
registerable. This contention, in my opinion, is not correct. The Supreme Court in the
case of Kale V. By. Director of Consolidation , (AIR 1976 SC 807), held that a family
arrangement in case it is oral needs no registration, but if the terms thereof were
reduced into writing, it became imperative to have the document registered and
unless it was registered, it could not be looked into. The pleas of family arrangement
is sought to be derived from Exhibit-1. That document is in writing. Even if it was
treated to be a family arrangement, it required registration, and having not been
registered, it could not be looked into for the purposes of showing it to be a family
arrangement.
46. He has relied upon a judgment of the Madras High Court in the case of Ranganatha Gounder v.
Perumal Nattar AIR 1999 Madras 133 wherein vide paragraph-3 of the judgment the Court has held
thus:
"3. Mr.V Raghavachari, learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner, therefore
contended that the order of the Court below is bad in law and the document shall not
be received in evidence. Mr. K. Kannan, learned counsel appearing for the
respondent would state that there is no legal right in favour of the defendant as a
lessee when he executed the document in question and when that is so, he cannot
validly transfer or extinguish any such alleged right in the property. Therefore,
according to him, the document is not hit be Secs. 17 (1) (b) and 49 (c) of the Act. In
elaborating this argument, he wold add that there is no lease document between the
parties and, therefore, there is no legal right in the defendant. Applying my mind to
the argument of the learned Counsel for the respondent, I find that no foundation is
laid for such an argument. It must be noticed that the plaintiff himself relies upon
this document. Mr. V. Raghavachari, in support of his contention that this document
requires compulsory registration and in the absence of the same, it shall not be
received in evidence, brought to my notice three judgments viz. Rangayya Appa Rau
v. Kameshwara Rau , (1897) ILR 20 Mad 367: 7 m ad LJ 59 (DB); Neelakanta Rao.
Vs. Sate of Mysore, AIR 1960 Mys 87 (DB) and M.S. Ram Singh V. B.S. Surana , AIR
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124606142/ 22Puneet Kumar Singh vs Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. And ... on 19 December, 2019
1972 Cal 190 (DB) . In the first case, the plaintiff was a Zamidar ad the defendant was
a tenant. He sues for declaration of his title and for possession of certain land of
which the first defendant had been in possession as a tenant. It appears that the
tenant having fallen into difficulties executed a document on the 20th June, 1888
addressed to the plaintiff in the following terms:
" To the Zamidar, (sic) & C, relinquishment report put in by Govindarazulau
Kameswara Rau, cultivator of Gurazada. Being unable to cultivae the 16 acres 84
cents of dry land and 7 acrs and 87 cents of wet land, 24 acres and 72 cents in all
which I have been cultivating in the village of Gurazada, and finding it inconvenient
to pay the arrears on it, I have relinquished the rights to the Sirkar (i.e. Zamidar). I
agree to the removal of that land from the village accounts in my name for Fasli 1298
and to your disposing of the same at your pleasure without may having anything to
do with the arrears of Rs. 600 and odd due thereon. This relinquishment report is put
in with consent."
The Courts below refused to admit that document for want of registration. In that context, the
learned Judges of this Court held that the document referred to above was one given for
consideration which moved from the plaintiff to the defendant, that is the waiver by the former of
his right to the arrears of rent amounting to Rs. 600 due at the time of relinquishment, which is
clear from the terms of the instrument itself and therefore, it requires registration. In Neelakanta
Rao v. state of Mysore (AIR 1960 Mys 87) (referred above) , the question that was considered is
whether the surrender deed executed between the tenant in favour of the landlord requires
registration or not. The learned Judges have held as follows:
"A surrender deed executed by the tenant in favour of the landlord in respect of this
tenancy the due of which exceeds Rs. 100 is clearly an instrument which purports to
extinguish the right of the tenant, the value of which is over Rs. 100/- and as such
comes within Cl. (B) of Sec. 17 91) and therefore is compulsorily registable. Such a
document if not registered, cannot be received in evidence of the transaction of
surrender affecting the property in view of S.49, Registration Act."
This was followed in the last judgment referred to above, In the case on h and, there is no dispute
that the value of the property is more than Rs. 100/- since the plaintiff himself valued the suit
properties at Rs. 300/-. Therefore, I have no hesitation to hold that the document dated 22-6-1995
stated to be entered into between the defendant and the plaintiff in O.S. No. 859 of 1995 on the file
of Additional District Munsif, Villupuram, is compulsorily registrable and as it is not so done, it is
inadmissible in evidence. Civil Revision petition is allowed. No costs Consequently C.M.P. No. 17480
of 1998 is dismissed."
47. Learned counsel for the respondent has finally relied upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the
case of Kale and others v. Deputy Director of Consolidation and others to argue that the family
arrangement though have been held to be binding amongst the members of the family but such
family arrangements may not be having any binding effect in respect of third party who is a stranger
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124606142/ 23Puneet Kumar Singh vs Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. And ... on 19 December, 2019
to the same and further no arrangement in respect of the strangers who are not part of the family
would amount to a valid settlement creating rights, can be permitted to do away with the condition
of registration of such a document. Further he has argued that even in cases of family settlement
where it is sought to be reduced in writing then it is compulsorily required to be registered one. He
submits that an oral family settlement may have a mutual binding effect and to that extent it may
determine the rights of the parties to which they mutually agreed but when it is sought to be
documented to have a force of law then it is required to be registered one. He has placed reliance
upon paragraph-4 of the judgment of the Apex Court in which speaking for himself and for the
majority V. R. Krishna Iyer, J and Murtaza Fazl Ali, J observed thus:
"(4) It is well settled that registration would be necessary only if the terms of the
family arrangement are reduced into writing. Here also, a distinction should be made
between a document containing the terms and recitals of a family arrangement made
unde the document and a mere memorandum prepared after the family arrangment
had already been made either for the purpose of the record or for information of the
court for making necessary mutation. In such a case the memorandum itself does not
create or extinguish any rights in immovable properties and therefore does not fall
within the mischief of Section 17(2) (sic (Section 17 (1) (b)?) of the Registration Act
and is, therefore not compulsorily registrable;"
48. Thus, the judgment of the High Court was set aside on the ground that it did not acknowledge
the oral settlement between the parties for the reason that parties on account of some oral
settlement/ some mutual settlement that was sustainable but then the High Court erred in law in
rejecting such compromise only for being unregistered. It is argued by learned counsel for the
respondent that the Apex Court took the view on account of the fact that mutuation petition before
the Assistant Commissioner did not carry any terms of the family settlement but was merely in the
nature of memorandum. Justice R.S. Sarkaria though gave a separate judgment but agreed to the
findings returned by the majority on the ground that since the petition did not itself create or
decline any right qua the immovable property above the value of Rs. 100/- or more was not hit by
Section 17(b) of the Registration Act.
49. It has been finally submitted by the learned counsel appearing for respondent Corporation that
since the condition prescribed under the alleged surrender letter amounted to variation of the
conditions of the original lease, and so it was of necessity required to be registered in view of Section
17 of the Registration Act, 1908. Learned counsel for the respondent has further sought to
distinguish the legal position prior to 1908 from post 1908 when Indian Registration Act came into
force.
50. On the consideration of business prospects and discretion of the Corporation to consider the
land as suitable or not, learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that evaluation of credentials
and land evaluation at the site is primary function of the committee constituted for such purpose
and the committee so constituted conducts its affairs very fairly in the presence of the applicant and
after such exercise being conducted if it is found that the land is not suitable, Corporation has no
reason to disagree unless there exists any element of bias, mala fides or arbitrariness reflected from
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124606142/ 24Puneet Kumar Singh vs Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. And ... on 19 December, 2019
the action and the decision taken by the committee. The judgment of committee qua suitability of
site on the spot and wisdom of the Corporation's officials in the evaluation of the report qua
suitability of land should not be ordinarily permitted to be questioned because it is the ultimate
interest of the Corporation which is at the stake and not the person who has applied for the
allotment of dealership. It is argued that to the extent of fairness in action, one can always plead for
right to be considered but where no such element is detectable, one cannot claim the allotment as a
rule merely because one has been selected in the draw of lots.
51. It is argued by the learned counsel for the respondent Corporation that since the lease itself has
become questionable even if not by institution of civil proceedings at the end of lessor or lessee but
the papers and the document that have been executed did have the elements to make it questionable
in a court of law, and so the Corporation cannot be compelled to set up petrol pump unit for the sale
of petroleum products compulsorily over such place.
52. Having heard learned counsels for the parties and their arguments advanced across the bar and
having perused the records and having considered the merits in this case, two points emerge:
(A) Whether the piece of land offered by the petitioner is a subject matter of a valid
lease deed, and so an offer of land deserves to be considered under Group-I?
(B) Whether the suitability of the land determined by the Corporation can be
questioned and discretion of the respondent Corporation in the facts and
circumstances of the present case, should be judicially reviewed in the absence of any
mala fides or arbitrariness.
53. Now coming to the question that relates to the lease document of the petitioner dated 14/
15.12.2018 presented by the petitioner seeking allotment of the retail outlet dealership, it is needed
to be examined as to whether the rights created under the said lease agreement could be said to be a
valid one and to that extent the lease to be held valid so as to hold the respondent's stand to the
contrary as incorrect.
54. Lease has come to be defined under the Transfer of Property Act as a transfer of a right to enjoy
such property, made for certain time, expressed or implied or in perpetuity in consideration of price
paid or promised (Section 105 T.P. Act). So virtually transfer of property and interest therein by
means of lease deed could be time specific or in perpetuity. A lease can, of course, be in the form of a
written contract or as per the local usage (106 TP Act) . However, whether time specific or in
perpetuity a lease has to be made only by a registered instrument but it should be accompanied by
delivery of possession by the lessor in favour of the lessee (107 TP Act).
55. The rights and liabilities of the lessor as per Section 108 of the T.P Act are governed by the terms
and condition that are contained in the lease document and so also they guide the future course of
action for the purposes of determination of lease except as provided for under Section 111 of the T.P.
Act, or to further create such lease in favour of a third party.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124606142/ 25Puneet Kumar Singh vs Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. And ... on 19 December, 2019
56. The argument advanced in the present case centers around the provision contained under
Section 111 of the T.P. Act especially clauses (e) and (f) that talk of express and implied surrender of
lease. Learned counsel for the petitioner has argued first in favour of clause (e) of Section 111 and
since the surrender letter has been objected to by the respondent being not a registered document as
it varies the terms and conditions of the lease by conduct of dividing/ partitioning two property by
lessee, alternatively it has been argued that the letter of surrender and thereafter no objection by the
original lessee in respect of subsequent lease executed by the tenure-holder in favour of the
petitioner, would amount to implied surrender.
57. Learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn our attention to paragraph-27 of quoted
hereinabove in the case of H.K. Sharma (supra) where implied surrender of lease has been discussed
referring to another judgment of the Apex Court in the Case of Shah Mathurdas Maganlal & Co, that
creation of a new relationship or relinquishment of the possession, is an act indicative of implied
surrender of the lease and therefore, it is argued that since by the letter dated 15.9.2018 the original
lease virtually surrendered certain area of the lease property in favour of the tenure holder lessor, it
would amount to be a valid surrender in view of Section 111 and as such the relinquishment of the
right would not require to be registered on one hand, and the second is that since the original lesee
did not put any objection to the subsequent lease of a part of land in favour of the petitioner on
14/15.12.2018, such a conduct would be deemed as it would amount to be an implied surrender.
58. We have carefully gone through the judgment of the Apex Court and we find that the Apex Court
has held vide paragraph 29 that the lease rights since are governed by the terms and condition
contained therein and if the subsequent agreement did not provide about the fate of tenancy earlier
created, such subsequent agreement would not amount to surrender of tenancy rights created under
the lease and thus, vide paragraphs 32 and 33 the Court has held thus:
"32. As observed supra, such is not the case here because we do not find any such
clause or a clause akin thereto in the agreement dated 13-5-1993 and nor we find that
the existing condition in the agreement discern the intention of the parties to
surrender the tenancy agreement either expressly or impliedly.
33. In the light of the foregoing discussion, we are of the considered opinion that the
tenancy in question between the parties did not result in its determination as
contemplated under Section 111 of the TP Act due to execution of the agreement
dated 13-5-1993 between the parties for sale of the suit house and the same remained
uneffected not withstanding execution of the agreement dated 13-5-1993."
59. Applying the above principle to the facts of the present case, we find that in this case the term of
the lease did not provide any such surrender or transfer of part of the land and, therefore, it is
difficult to accept the letter of the lessee dated 15.9.2018 to be a letter referable to clause-7 of the
lease agreement as the said clause does not talk of the part surrender of the lease rights qua land, or
right in respect of part of the land or the relinquishment of rights in respect of any specific part of
the land, nor, does it talk of part specific surrender of land nor, as to how part of land came to
identified to justify any part specific surrendered of the lease rights. No such measurement was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124606142/ 26Puneet Kumar Singh vs Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. And ... on 19 December, 2019
carried out on the spot to partition the land lawfully by a lessee in the absence of such right being
conferred under the lease agreement to provide it a separate regular revenue number so as to hold
that there was a consent or agreement between the original lessee and lessor to vary the lease in the
manner in which it is stated to be done on account of the letter issued by the original lessee.
60. Coming to the judgment in the case of Abdul Majid (supra) it again refers to the mutual
agreement of the rights as a whole while relinquishment or surrender has come to be recognized
under Section 111of T.P. Act and that it cannot be read to be recognized part surrender of the lease
rights. In cases where the part cannot be identified except when undertaken in accordance with
provision of revenue laws and if the land falls in a revenue village the partition, therefore, unless it is
identifiable in law with due exercise of act of partition, the part surrender of rights would amount to
varying the condition of the lease agreement unilaterally and the legal position being very much
clear that the document that acknowledges any relinquishment of rights in variation to the term of
lease it is required to be registered. Such rights would not acquire validity by mere oral consent of
the parties. The Apex Court judgment in the case of Sunil Kumar (supra) is very much attracted and
applicable here in this case that the document that varies the essential terms of the existing
registered lease is required to be registered under Section 17 of the Registration Act.
61. The doctrine of implied surrender as has come to be discussed by Andhra Pradesh High Court in
its judgment in the case of Konijeti Venkayya (supra) also talks of a fact position where the
subsequent agreement or mutual agreement has come to be reached between the parties in respect
of lease property. Interest that has been held to be valid in the said case would not be attracted in
the setting of the facts of the present case where there is no such surrender of wholesome lease
rights at any point of time. It is a case where the surrender is guided by an act of partitioning the
land which condition is not there in the present case to be taken as a right conferred upon the lessee
under the original lease agreement, inasmuch as Clause 7 of the original lease agreement also does
not stipulate any such situation where lease rights can be relinquished in part.
62. In our view judgment in the cases of Jamuna Oil Mills (supra) and T.K. Lathika (supra) would
not be attracted as well in the present case. The land lord and tenant relationship which has come to
be discussed in the said case is in respect of the tenanted premises as a whole the area of land that
had been surrendered and not any part of the interest being transferred or relinquished in respect
thereof.
63. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has vehemently urged that in the light of the
judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Krishan Kumar Khemka (supra) the part surrender of the
lease has come to be recognized and acknowledged as valid in law and a mere part surrender would
not amount to surrender of entire lease rights. It is interesting to note that in the said case the Court
was virtually dealing with the rights of the lessor because the lessee who had the tenanted premises
of four flats had come to relinquish rights in respect of two flats duly identified as separate property
and then in respect of remaining two flats the Court observed that it would be a surrender of rights
in respect of part of the property and the Court, therefore, held that surrender of a part of the lease
property would not amount to implied surrender of the entire tenancy and the rest of the tenant
would remain untouched. Grindlays Bank that was the tenant of the four flat and had surrendered
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124606142/ 27Puneet Kumar Singh vs Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. And ... on 19 December, 2019
two flat only which was treated to be a partial surrender and therefore, in that fact background the
Court held that they would continue to enjoy the tenancy in respect of the two remaining flats in
their possession.
64. It is not disputed by the parties that the lease agreement is governed under the Transfer of
Property Act and, therefore, if the lease rights can be created by a registered document and the
document does not create any right that the lease property can be partitioned and any part
surrender thereof can be made by the lessee and the property is identified as one and the same, in
our considered opinion lessee cannot be permitted partition it in the absence of express condition so
as to relinquish interest in part.
65. The judgment in the case of State of H.P. Vs. Kishan Lal (supra) very clearly holds that Section
111 (e) contemplates surrender of the entire interest under the lease and not a part of the interest
alone. It is worth noticing that the judgment of the Apex Court in the Case of H.P v. Kishan Lal by a
two judge bench has not been referred to and discussed in the case of Krishan Kumar Khemka
(supra) relied upon by learned counsel for the petitioner.
66. In the case of H. K. Sharma Vs. Ram Lal (supra) the Apex Court had categorically held that a
subsequent agreement ipso facto would not result in determination of lease. The question therefore,
is what are the terms and conditions provided in the lease and any act bringing an end to the
agreement between the original lessor and the lessee has to be seen and given validity if mutually
agreed in tune with terms and condition of the original lease agreement.
67. Coming to the issue of registration of a document as it is argued by the learned counsel for the
respondent Corporation that the lease surrender letter dated 9.6.2018 was required to be registered
one in order to create any right in favour of the lessor, to execute a subsequent lease, we find that
while the lease agreement is necessarily required to be registered under Section 107 of the Transfer
of Property Act, Section 17 of the Registration Act provides that non testamentary instruments that
purport, decline or limit or extinguish rights in immovable property are required to be registered.
Since in the present case, it has been argued by the learned counsel for the respondent Corporation
that the doctrine of implied surrender would not be attracted as a part of property is sought to be
surrender or in other words part of interest in the property is sought to be relinquished, the letter
which has set into motion a subsequent lease was necessarily required to be registered one and since
it is not a registered document, it cannot create any right in favour of the lessor to execute a
subsequent agreement in respect of that property or part of the property surrendered.
68. He also argues that while the rights and properties are governed under the lease agreement in
between the parties if a document is not registered which is otherwise required to be compulsorily
registered, then on that count any subsequent document has come to be executed, the Corporation
being third party is not bound by such agreement nor, there can it be compelled to acknowledge and
admit that such a subsequent lease agreement as valid one. If any document is not required for any
collateral purposes and was definitely meant to create rights to further create a third party right,
such document of necessity, is required to be registered under the law. The Collateral purpose it is
argued, as defined under the said judgment, would not be for the purposes of creating or assigning
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124606142/ 28Puneet Kumar Singh vs Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. And ... on 19 December, 2019
or limiting or extinguishing any right in the immovable property. Collateral purpose has also come
to be defined in the Ratan Lal and others (supra) by Allahabad High Court wherein it was held that
parties in a family arrangement that create right by putting them down in writing would not amount
a collateral purpose and such document is required to be necessarily registered. So also the Madras
High Court in the Case of Raghunath G (supra) and the same has remained reiterated by the Apex
Court in the case of Kalu and other (supra). It is therefore, rightly argued that since the letter of the
original lessee is sought to create a new kind of right in favour of the lessor, relinquishing the rights
in part of the property, it would require to be registered in law.
69. What the petitioners have sought to urge is that the letter dated 15.9.2018 should be read in
evidence as an act of surrender of lease, cannot be accepted in the light of legal principle discussed
above. It is a case where the petitioner wants the Corporation to read a document which is otherwise
inadmissible in evidence for want of due registration. Act of surrender under the letter dated
15.9.2018 is an express act and not guided by any mutual agreement and therefore, to that extent it
being unilateral document creating right in favour of the lessor by means of alleged relinquishment
of interest by the original lessee, it cannot be binding on the Corporation, a third party and the
Corporation cannot be held to have manifestly erred in rejecting the letter that entitled the original
tenure holder to create a further lease.
70. The legal position that emerges out from the above discussions can be summarized as under:
(i) Every transfer of rights and interest by a lease agreement to be time specific or in
perpetuity is required to be in writing.
(ii) Every transfer of rights and interest in immovable property for a period beyond
one year under lease agreement is required to be by registered instrument.
(iii) A lease agreement lays down terms and condition granting rights and interest of
lessee and any variation done by the lessee is permissible in writing only and such
document is also required to be registered.
(iv) Section 111 (e) and (f) contemplate relinquishment of rights and interest whether
by express act or implied as required in law but such relinquishment should be of
lease rights in its entirety as it determine the base as a whole.
(v) Part relinquishment of interest and rights qua leased property is recognized in
India but that would be (a) subject to lease agreement (b) if lease property can be
divided and identifiable, in other words part relinquishment/ surrender should be
part specific and this position should be discernable from the terms of lease.
(vi) Division of a holding/ land or property under a lease if identified as one, it would
amount to verying the terms and conditions of lease and, so is necessarily required to
be registered.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/124606142/ 29Puneet Kumar Singh vs Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. And ... on 19 December, 2019
(vii) Any mutual agreement to permit part surrender of property under a lease except
when it provides for that, unless registered, will not bind a third party, as having no
evidentiary value thereof and no rights can flow in favour of a third person.
71. In view of the above we are of the view that the lease deed if it has come to be rejected by the
Corporation for not creating sufficient right in favour of the petitioner so as to accept offer of land, a
subject matter of the lease agreement for the purpose of allotment of retail outlet dealership,
nothing wrong has been committed and therefore the question-A stands answered in negative
against the petitioner.
72. So far as the other question regarding the discretion of the Corporation, we are of the view that
the Corporation is in the best position to decide which land suits to its business prospects and the
discretion exercised in that regard has to be seen only from the view that the corporation would be
interested in providing its investment only in safe and secured land. If the Corporation has found
that the document pertaining to the land are not absolutely clean in the sense that there exists
chances of litigation in future qua the land in which investment is to be made, the Corporation is in
best position to understand to take decision as to whether the investment should be made or not
over such land. So the suitability of the land lies within the domain and the discretion of the
Corporation.
73. The Indian Oil Corporation being a public sector corporation and huge public money being
involved in the matter any investment of the public money in a property that may turn out to be
disputed in future would be against the public policy also and, therefore, we are of the opinion that
for the purpose of suitability of land the discretion exercised by the Corporation in the normal
circumstances be not interfered with unless it is found to be an act absolutely arbitrary hit by Article
14 of the Constitution or for mala fides in exercise of the discretion by the Corporation.
74. An exercise of evaluation and decision making is subject to judicial review in the event an action
is vitiated for bias, mala fides and in violation of principles of natural justice. Even evaluation of
credentials if vitiated for utter ignorance of laws or by whimsical action, would invite interference
but where a document becomes a matter of contentious issue and involves complicated question of
facts qua title and needed adjudication by a civil court for its valid declaration as involving valuable
rights of parties, Corporation, a third party would be justified in keeping its hand off. Case in hand
has the element to invite long drawn civil litigation in future and so if corporation decides to term
such land as not suitable, we do not find any fault with the Corporation.
75. From the discussions that we have made above, we do not find that the discretion exercised by
the Corporation is in any manner arbitrary or capricious one so as to warrant interference by this
Court under Article 226 of the Constitution. Consequently the writ petition fails and is dismissed
with no order as to cost.
