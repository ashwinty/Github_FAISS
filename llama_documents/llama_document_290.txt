JUDGMENT
Rajesh Balia, J.
1. Vide State Finance Act, 2004, Section 4A was inserted in the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1994 which
reads as under:
4A. Levy of tax on retail sale price,(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any
other provisions of this Act or the Rules made thereunder, tax on sale of such goods,
as may be specified by the State Government by notification in the official gazette,
shall be levied and collected on the retail sale price of such goods abated by the rate
specified in the said notification.
(2) The goods to be specified under Sub-section (1) shall be those in relation to which
it is required under the provisions of the Standards of Weights and Measures Act,
1976 Central Act No. 60 of 1976 or the Rules made thereunder or under any other law
for the time being in force, to declare on the package thereof the retail sale price of
such goods.
(3) The State Government may, for the purpose of fixing the rate of abatement under
Sub-section (1), take into account the amount of sales tax and other local taxes, if any,
payable on such goods.
Explanation.(i) Where on the package of any goods different retail sale prices are declared with
reference to different areas, the retail sale price declared with the reference to the area within the
State in which it is sold shall be deemed to be the retail sale price for the purposes of this section.
(ii) Where on the package of any goods different retail sale prices are declared with reference to
different areas and none of the areas falls within the State, the maximum of such retail sale prices
shall be deemed to be the retail price for the purposes of this section.
2. The present writ petition has been filed to challenge the constitutional validity of the aforesaid
provision. It envisages levy of sales tax on any transaction of sale of notified goods not on the actual
price of consideration which is paid or becomes payable by the buyer to seller on such sales which
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 1Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
have taken place, but on the "maximum retail price" of the goods declared on the package as per the
provisions of the Standards of Weights and Measures Act, 1976 or the Rules framed thereunder or
under any other law for the time being in force which is chargeable only at the last point sale by a
retailer. The provision is not extended generally to all commodities sold in package and in relation
to which it is required to print retail price thereon but only to such goods as may be specified by the
State Government by notification in the official gazette as may be abated by the rate specified in the
said notification.
3. The present writ petition has been filed by registered association of the wholesale
dealers/distributor of Chemists and Druggists engaged in the business of selling of medicines, drugs
and pharmaceutical preparation to the retailers.
4. The principal contention on which the validity of the aforesaid provision has been challenged is
that it takes into account the artificial amount as turnover for the purpose of tax on "sales of goods".
5. The tax on sale must be leviable with reference to the something related to taxing event, the sale
or purchase of goods which become subject of charge and not de hors it. One or other component of
such taxing event, whether be price or quantity of goods may be considered measure of tax to which
rate can be applied and can be collected from the person connected with such transaction and not
any criterion de hors the taxing event.
6. Entry 54 of the Second List of the Seventh Schedule which provides subject on which State
Legislature can make law reads "tax on sale or purchase of goods other than newspapers subject to
provision of entry 92-A of List I".
7. The expression "tax on sale of goods" used in entry 54 of the Second List of the Seventh Schedule
has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to mean tax on the sale of goods, as defined under the
Sale of Goods Act, 1930 as modified/extended by Clause (29A) of Article 366 inserted vide
Forty-sixth Amendment Act, 1942, The tax on sale of medicines under the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act,
1994 and notification issued thereunder is a single point tax on the sale within the State of
Rajasthan. The first point sale in the State of Rajasthan in most cases which attracts levy of sales tax
is by the wholesale distributors to the retailers and not by retailers to end consumer when alone
maximum retail price can be charged. Under the Act of 1976 and under the provisions of the Drugs
Price Control Order, 1995 issued by the Central Government under Section 3 of the Essential
Commodities Act, 1955, the maximum retail price is determined in the case of Scheduled
Formulations only. But maximum retail price is required to be displayed on the label of container as
well as package in respect of all the drugs whether scheduled or non-scheduled formulations. It has
been urged that by and large the first point sale in State of Rajasthan takes place between C and F
agents/consignee agents/depots on the one hand as sellers, registered dealers and the wholesalers
and in case of inter-State transactions such first point sale takes place between distributors and
wholesalers at the negotiated and contracted price agreed to between them respective buyers and
sellers which obviously cannot exceed the printed retail price minus retailer's margin and
wholesaler's margin.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 2Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
8. With the aforesaid premise, it has further been contended that the mention of price on the
package under the aforesaid provision is the maximum retail price and not the price necessarily or
actually charged at the end sale for any transaction of sale of medicines in the State. The first sale
within the State which alone is taxable under the provisions of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, much
lesser price than the maximum retail price is paid or payable on contractual basis. In this
connection, it is also stated that under the Drugs Price Control Order the margin at which the
medicines are to be sold to retailer has also been fixed at a minimum level that is to say unless
otherwise permitted, a formulation has to be sold to a retailer keeping at least 16 per cent margin in
the case of scheduled drugs. Thus, by devising the aforesaid legal fiction for deeming an artificial
sale price for levy of tax having no nexus to the taxable event transactions of sale of goods at a
money consideration paid or payable as defined under the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 is beyond the
legislative competence of the State Legislature and therefore, the provision is ultra vires.
9. Reliance has been placed on a large number of decisions commencing from Sales Tax Officer,
Pillibhit v. Budh Prakash Jai Prakash , holding that the liability to tax on sale of goods arises only in
respect of a completed sale as per the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930.
10. One of the essential part of a sale under the Act of 1930 is consideration for sale which means
price "paid" or "payable" but not an amount which may be price at which a transaction may take
place at a future sale and holding that the State Legislature cannot by enlarging the definition of sale
bring within the tax net a transaction or any component which is not in accordance with "sale"
within the meaning of Section 4 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930.
11. Since by the impugned provision, the tax is made leviable not with reference to a price in money
paid or payable by the buyer to the seller who are the contracting parties to completed sale of drugs
which attracts the charge but with reference to a price determined fictionally with reference to
amount that may be chargeable as a price for a transaction of sale that may take place in future, it
does not fulfil the presence of all the constituent elements of a completed sale as per the Sale of
Goods Act. It is beyond the competence of the State Legislature to tax the sale at maximum retail
price which is neither a consideration paid nor payable for the completed sale.
12. The provisions have also been challenged on the ground of vagueness.
13. Defending the validity of the provision, it has been contended by the learned Advocate-General
and learned Additional Advocate-General that what is to be measure of tax on a sale is within the
domain of the State Legislature. Under the impugned provision tax is levied on a completed sale
within the meaning of Section 4 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. However, in what manner the charge
is to be levied is a matter of details which can be worked out by legislation. The fact that the
maximum retail price is to be determined statutorily and the State Legislature has taken into
account the fact that the actual consideration at the first point tax may be less than the maximum
retail price that may be charged ultimately from the consumer at the last point sale as provided for
abatement of maximum retail price by reducing there from the sum at prescribed rates of
abatement, for the purpose of levy of tax, it provides sound basis for uniform liability in the State on
such transactions. The levy of tax with reference to maximum retail price cannot be said to be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 3Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
wanting in nexus with the taxing event. Therefore, the impugned provision and notifications cannot
be said to be ultra vires any provision of the Constitution.
14. However, the respondents do not seriously dispute the proposition that but for taking maximum
retail price as a basis to provide measure of tax, no fictional price be fixed as measure of tax on sale
of goods.
(A) Sale as subject of tax on "sale or purchase of goods" under entry 54 of the State List:
15. Budh Prakash Jai Prakash [1954] 5 STC 193 (SC) : AIR 1954 SC 459, arose under the U.P. Sales
Tax Act, 1948. The question has arisen about levy of tax by the assessing authority on the turnover
relating to forward contract. The assessee has challenged that the imposition of sales tax on forward
contracts was ultra vires the powers of the State Legislature. The U.P. Sales Tax Act, 1948 has been
enacted by the Provincial Legislature in terms of the legislative power conferred on the Provincial
Legislature under the Government of India Act, 1935 under entry 48 in List II of the Seventh
Schedule to the said Act. Under Section 2(h) of the U.P. Act, "sales" was defined to include forward
contracts. The Supreme Court upheld that challenge by holding that the power conferred under
entry 48 to impose tax on the sale of goods can be exercised only when there is a sale under which
there is a transfer of property in the goods, and not when there is a mere agreement to sell. The State
Legislature cannot, by enlarging the definition of "sale" by including forward contracts arrogate to
itself a power which is not conferred upon it by the Constitution Act, and the definition of "sale" in
Section 2(h) of the Act 15 of 1948 must, to that extent, be declared "ultra vires".
16. It was further said:
... it would be proper to interpret the expression 'sale of goods' in entry 48 in the
sense in which it was used in legislation both in England and India and to hold that it
authorises the imposition of a tax only when there is a completed sale involving
transfer of title.
17. Significantly, the court observed about substance of the levy as under:
... The substance of the matter is that the sales tax is a levy on the price of the goods,
and the reason of the thing requires that such a levy should not be made, unless the
stage has been reached when the seller can recover the price under the contract.
18. The aforesaid decision while making it clear that subject "tax on sales of goods" in entry 48 of
List II of the Seventh Schedule of the 1935 Act providing for legislative field of sale of goods ought to
be confined to levy of tax on sales of goods as defined in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 and in
substance, it is a levy on price of goods and the State Legislature does not have power to enlarge the
definition of "sales" by creating a legal fiction and tax sales which have not come into existence.
19. The next case which falls for consideration and relied on by the learned Counsel for the
petitioners is State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley & Co. Madras Ltd. . The Constitution Bench of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 4Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
the Supreme Court considered in this case the construction of entry 48 in List II of the Seventh
Schedule to the Act of 1935 tax on the sale of goods which is in pari materia with entry 54 in List II
of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India. The question had arisen in a case arising under
the Madras General Sales Tax Act 1939 as amended by the Madras General Sales Tax Amendment
Act, 1947. The definition of "sale" in Section 2(h) was enlarged so as to include "a transfer of
property in goods involved in execution of works contract". By creating a legal fiction it was deemed
that in execution of a work, property in the goods involved in works contract is transferred as goods
so as to include value not the price of such goods as part of taxable turnover.
20. After referring to the definition of expression "sale of goods" from the times of Roman Law and
the Law in England the court culled out and approved the principle stated in Benzamin's work
"sale".
"Hence it follows that to constitute a valid sale, there must be a concurrence of the
following elements, viz., (1) Parties competent to contract; (2) mutual assent; (3) a
thing, the absolute or general property in which is transferred from the seller to the
buyer ; and (4) a price in money paid or promised.
21. On this premise, the court on considering the Indian Law and after referring to Section 77 of the
Contract Act, before enactment of Sale of Goods Act defining sale as originally enacted in it, and the
provisions of Indian Sale of Goods Act, 1930 reached the following conclusions about price as
essential element:
...that it must be supported by money consideration, and that as a result of the
transaction property must actually pass in the goods. Unless all these elements are
present, there can be no sale.
22. The court reached the following conclusions approving to its earlier decision in Budh Prakash
Jai Prakash :
...A power to enact a law with respect to tax on sale of goods under entry 48 must, to
be intra vires, be one relating in fact to sale of goods, and accordingly, the Provincial
Legislature cannot, in the purported exercise of its power to tax sales, tax
transactions which are not sales by merely enacting that they shall be deemed to be
sales 'sale' in entry 48 must be construed as having the same meaning which it has in
the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. It is of the essence of this concept that both the
agreement and the sale should relate to the same subject-matter.
Summing up the conclusion, the court said:
...the expression 'sale of goods' in entry 48 is a nomen juris, its essential ingredients
being an agreement to sell movables for a price and property passing therein
pursuant to that agreement.

23. The State Legislature does not have legislative competence to give the expression "sale of goods"
extended meaning and to enlarge its legislative field to cover those transactions for taxing which do
not properly conform to elements of sale of goods within Act of 1930. Tax on value of the material
used in construction of building was held to be ultra vires.
24. The decision in Firm of Peare Lal Hari Singh v. State of Punjab also relates to imposition of tax
on supply of materials used in building contracts and the court has followed its decision rendered in
Gannon Dunkerley & Co. and held that the expression "sale of goods" in entry 48 in List II of the
Seventh Schedule of the Government of India Act, 1935, has the same import which it bears in the
Sale of Goods Act, 1930.
25. The principle was reiterated in Bhopal Sugar Industries Ltd., M.P. v. D.P. Dube, Sales Tax
Officer, M.P. , where the question arose whether giving extended definition of "retail sale" in Section
2(1) of the Act, which sought to render consumption by the owner of motor spirit liable to tax under
the Act by virtue of Section 3, is beyond the competence of the State Legislature and hence void. The
court relying on its earlier decision in Gannon Dunkerley & Co. said:
... In a transaction of sale of goods which is liable to tax there must be concurrence of
the four elements, viz., (1) Parties competent to contract;
(2) Mutual assent;
(3) A thing, the absolute or general property in which is transferred from the seller to
the buyer ; and (4) A price in money paid or promised.
A transaction which does not conform to this traditional concept of sale cannot be regarded as one
in respect of which the State Legislature is competent to enact an Act imposing liability for payment
of tax.
26. The court quashed the assessment made on the aforesaid premise.
27. In K.L. Johar and Co. v. Deputy Commercial Tax Officer , the Supreme Court was called upon to
consider the case under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939 wherein the question arose whether
levy of sales tax in respect of hire-purchase transactions was illegal and unconstitutional and
Explanation I to Section 2(h) of the Act defining "sale" was beyond the competence of the State
Legislature. The Explanation provided that a transfer of goods on the hire-purchase or other
instalment system of payment shall, notwithstanding the fact that the seller retains the title in the
goods as security for payment of the price, be deemed to be a sale. The appellant-dealer contended
that this amounted to an extension of the meaning of the word "sale" beyond what it meant in the
Indian Sale of Goods Act, 1930 and void.
28. The Supreme Court opined, so far as the terms of agreement of hire- purchase were concerned
there are two sales, one by the dealer to the financier namely, the appellant in said case and the
other by the financier to the person who wanted to purchase the vehicle. As the Act levied a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 6Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
multi-point sales tax at the relevant time it was open to the State to tax both the sales and the fact
that the sale by the dealer to the appellant had been taxed will not affect the liability of the second
sale by the financier to the person who wanted to purchase the vehicle. However, significant for
present purposes, considering the validity of Explanation 1 noticed above, the court drew distinction
between sale on hire-purchase agreement on the one hand and the sale in which the price is to be
paid later by instalments on the other pointing out that, The essence of a sale is that the property is
transferred from seller to the buyer for a price, whether paid at once or paid later in instalments. On
the other hand, a hire-purchase agreement, as its very name implies, has two aspects. There is first
an aspect of bailment of the goods subjected to the hire-purchase agreement, and there is next an
element of sale which fructifies when the option to purchase, which is usually a term of
hire-purchase agreements, is exercised by the intending purchaser.
29. With this distinction in mind, the Explanation to the extent it permitted levy of tax even before
the option had been exercised to purchase the goods and the property was divested from seller to
vest in the purchaser, was held to be ultra vires as the State Legislature was not competent to extend
the meaning of word "sale" used in entry 54 of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution which
corresponds to entry 48 of the Government of India Act, 1935 and make something a sale which has
not come into existence as per term "sale" defined in the Indian Sale of Goods Act, 1930.
30. For reaching this conclusion, the court relied on its earlier decision in Budh Prakash Jai
Prakash's case [1954] 5 STC 193 (SC) : AIR 1954 SC 459 and Gannon Dunkerley & Co.'s case [1958]
9 STC 353 (SC) : AIR 1958 SC 560.
31. Having struck down the Explanation which made the liability to tax arising even before the sale
could fructify, went on to hold that the hire-purchase agreement entails two transactions of sale ;
one by seller to financier and other by financier to the ultimate buyer.
32. Another important question arose about the fixing of the price on which the tax could be levied
in respect of subsequent sale. In the case before the Supreme Court a vehicle was sold by the seller
to the financier for Rs. 5,000 and the financier had agreed to transfer the vehicle to the ultimate
buyer on hire of Rs. 1,487 per annum. Under the agreement the price for transfer of vehicle agreed
to be paid at the close of hire-purchase agreement was Re. 1. Financier had already paid the tax at
the time when he purchased vehicle from the seller at Rs. 5,000. While the Revenue contended that
entire hire money was to be treated as sale price, the appellant claimed that the sale price of the
vehicle could be as agreed between the financier and buyer that is Rs. 1.
33. The Supreme Court held that both the extreme contentions cannot be accepted. After
considering the impact of accepting either of the contentions, said:
...In order to arrive at the value at the time of the second sale to the hirer, the sales
tax authorities should take into consideration the depreciation of the vehicle and
such other matters as may be relevant in arriving at such price on which the sale can
be said to have taken place when the option is exercised, but that price must always
be less than the original price which was Rs. 5,000 in the example given above by us.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 7Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
34. Referring to the decision in Darngavil Coal Company v. Francis [1913] 7 Tax Cas 1, and
approving the ratio laid therein, the court held:
...Part of the amount is towards the hire and part towards the payment of price, and it
would be fore the sales tax authorities to determine in an appropriate way the price of
the vehicle on the date the hirer exercises his option and becomes the owner of the
vehicle after fulfilling the terms of the agreement.... it would be for the sales tax
authorities to decide as best they can the value of the vehicle on the date the option is
exercised and the property passes to the hirer. There may be two ways of doing it. The
sales tax authorities may split up the hire into two parts, namely, the amount paid as
consideration for the use of the vehicle so long as it was the property of the owner,
and the payment for the option on a future date to purchase the vehicle at a nominal
price. If the first part is determined the rest would be towards the payment of price.
35. This case accepted two principles. Firstly, that hire-purchase agreement contains two sales and
tax in case of later sale does not become payable until option to purchase is exercised by the hirer
and a completed transaction comes into existence and secondly, price content of second sale must
be determined by excluding there from hire content paid or payable by the hirer for use of thing
before exercise of option when title passes to him under a competed sale. The tax can be levied with
reference to that amount which can properly be said to be consideration for transferring title of
property in goods to buyer. Anything extra there from was excluded. In appropriate cases, it may be
for the taxing authority to determine the price at which a particular sale may be taxed, where it is
not possible to determine the price at the time when the sale actually takes place. This principle is in
consonance with Section 9 of the Sale of Goods Act, which provides for a contingency when price is
not determined by an agreement, it may be found by court on some reasonable basis.
36. The next line of cases which have been brought to the notice of the court are regarding the
supply of foods, snacks, beverages and other articles by the clubs to its members or their guests or
by the restaurant or hotels to their customers.
37. In Joint Commercial Tax Officer v. Young Men's Indian Association , the question arose once
again under the Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1959, in respect of levy of tax to be paid on supplies
of food and beverages and other articles to the members or their guests by the club. No profit was
made by the club in providing those amenities. Under the provisions of the Act, the supply or
distribution of goods by a society including a co-operative society, club, firm or any association to its
members, for cash, or for deferred payment, or other valuable consideration, whether or not in the
course of business, shall be deemed to be a sale for the purpose of the Act.
38. The court held that if there is no transfer of property from one to another there is no sale which
would be exigible to tax. If the club even though a distinct legal entity is only acting as an agent for
its members in the matter of supply of various preparations to them no sale would be involved as the
element of transfer would be completely absent. The High Court has held that the case of each club
was analogous to that of an agent or mandatory investing his own monies for preparing things for
consumption of the principal, and later recouping himself for the expenses incurred. The Supreme
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 8Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
Court agreed with this conclusion by referring to earlier decided cases by the courts in India as well
as by courts in England and concluded that as no transaction of sale was involved there could be no
levy of tax under the provisions of the Act on the supply of refreshments and preparations by each
one of the clubs to its members.
39. In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Associated Hotels of India Ltd. , the Supreme Court adopted the
concept of the English Law that "there is no sale when food and beverages are supplied to guests
residing in hotels". It was pointed out that supply of meals was essentially in the nature of service
provided to them and could not be identified as a transaction of sale. The contention of the Revenue
that such transaction can be split into two parts ; one of the service and other of sale on food stuffs
was rejected.
40. Considering the provisions of the Punjab General Sales Tax Act, 1948 a Constitution Bench of
the Supreme Court held that the transaction between a hotelier and a visitor to his hotel whereby
the former receives the latter for lodging in his hotel is essentially a contract of service and where in
the performance of the service and as part of the amenities incidental to that service, the hotelier
serves meals at stated hours, the transaction is not sale.
41. Thus, reiterating that the essential elements of sale of goods, i.e., to transfer any goods for value
received or receivable is absent in service of foodstuffs of hotel to its residents, the State legislation's
power to tax was confined to the sales of goods in stricto sensu under the provisions of the Sale of
Goods Act, 1930.
42. The principle was extended and reiterated in respect of supply of foodstuffs in restaurants.
Northern India Caterers India Ltd. v. Lt. Governor of Delhi , was a case relating to restaurant
located in a hotel where meals were also served to casual visitors. The court holding service of such
meals was not taxable as a sale under the Bengal Finance Sales Tax Act, 1941 as applied to Union
territory of Delhi. A review petition against the decision in Northern India Caterers India Ltd. v. Lt.
Governor of Delhi was also rejected by the Supreme Court vide judgment reported in Northern India
Caterers (India) Ltd. v. Lt. Governor of Delhi .
(B) Effect of regulatory statute on element of voluntary agreement
43. In the case of Vishnu Agencies (Pvt) Ltd. v. Commercial Tax Officer , a seven-Judge Bench of the
Supreme Court considered the question whether compulsory sale under any statute is exigible to
sales tax. The contention was raised that amongst the four essentials of sale as approved by the
Supreme Court from Benjamin on Sale and that compulsory sale under statute lacks voluntar-iness
or mutual assent required for making an event transaction of sale. The question arose in the context
of commodities declared as essential commodities and governed by the various orders regulating the
sale and supply of such commodities under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 with a view to
making the goods available to the consumer at a fair price. Such orders sometimes provide that a
person in need of any essential commodity like cement, cotton, coal or iron and steel must apply to
the prescribed authority for a permit for obtaining the commodity. Those wanting to engage in the
business of supplying the commodity are also required to possess a dealer's licence. The permit
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 9Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
holder can obtain the supply of goods only to the extent of the quantity specified under permit, from
the named dealer only and at a controlled price. The dealer who is asked to supply the stated
quantity of the commodities to particular permit holder has no option but to supply the stated
quantity of goods at the controlled price. Adverting to the essential elements of sale of goods for the
purpose of levy of tax, the court referring to settled principle that subject of tax is a contract of sale
of goods, held that so long as mutual consent is not totally excluded in any dealing in law it is a
contract.
44. The court approved the principle enunciated in Indian Steel & Wire Products Ltd. v. State of
Madras and in Andhra Sugars Ltd. v. State of Andhra Pradesh .
45. In the former case, the court observed that though the controller fixed the base price of the steel
products and determined the buyers, the parties were still free to decide the other terms of the
bargain, as for example, the time and date of delivery and the time and mode of payment and
therefore, it could not be said that there was no agreement between the parties to sell and buy the
goods. It was held that though the area within which it was possible for the parties to bargain was
greatly reduced on account of the Iron and Steel Control Order, it was not correct to contend that
because law imposes restrictions on freedom of contract, there could be no contract at all. "So long
as mutual assent is not completely excluded in any dealing, in law it is a contract."
46. In the latter case, the court observed that the cane grower in the factory zone was free to make or
not to make an offer of sale of cane to the occupier of the factory. But if he made an offer, the
occupier of the factory was bound to accept it but the consent of the occupier not being caused by
coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake was "free consent" as defined in
Section 14 of the Contract Act, even though he was obliged by law to enter into the agreement. "The
compulsion of law is not coercion as defined in Section 15 of the Act" and "in the eye of the law, the
agreement is freely made."
47. Hidayatulla, J., who delivered a dissenting opinion in New India Sugar Mills Ltd. v.
Commissioner of Sales Tax, Bihar had observed that:
'though it was true that consent makes a contract of sale, such consent "may be
expressed or implied" and it cannot be said that unless the offer and acceptance are
there in an elementary form, there can be no taxable sale'. The matter was summed
up pithily stating that so long as the parties trade under controls at fixed price and
accept these as any other law of the realm because they must, the contract is at the
fixed price both sides having or deemed to have agreed to such a price. Consent
under the law of contract need not be expressed, it can be implied.
48. The above principle from dissenting judgment was approved in Vishnu Agencies Pvt Ltd. v.
Commercial Tax Officer .
49. All the aforesaid cases considered the four elements referred to above in a sale essential to
constitute a sale of goods which alone could be subjected to tax under entry 54 of List II by the State
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 10Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
legislation, and where any one or other element was found lacking, but the State legislation tried to
levy tax on transaction strictly not falling within the purview of sale defined under the Act of 1930 by
giving extended meaning to sale of goods, the courts intervened to strike down such transgression.
Ultimately, the Parliament stepped in by amending Article 366 of the Constitution and inserted
Clause (29A) by giving extended meaning to the expression "tax on sale or purchase of goods" to
include certain transactions which had been held to be not falling within the purview of sale in the
decisions referred to above.
50. Clause (29A) of Article 366 included within definition of tax on sale or purchase of goods : (i) a
tax on the transit otherwise than in the form of a contract of property in any goods for cash, deferred
payment or other valuable consideration ; (ii) a tax on the transfer of property in goods whether as
goods or in some other form involved in execution of works contract; (iii) a tax on delivery of goods
by hire-purchase or any system of payment by instalment; (iv) a tax on the transaction of right to
use any goods for any purpose (whether or not for a specified period) for cash, deferred payment or
other valuable considerations ; (v) a tax on the supply of goods by any unincorporated association or
body of persons to a member thereof for cash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration,
and lastly (vi) a tax on the supply by way of or as part of any service or in any other manner
whatsoever of goods being food or any other article for human consumption or any drink whether or
not intoxicating where such supply is for cash or deferred payment or other valuable considerations.
This clause was inserted in the Constitution by Forty-sixth Constitution Amendment Act, 1982
retrospectively.
51. Certain transactions which were held to be not falling within definition of sale of goods and were
held to be outside the purview of entry 54 of State List, as per the different judgments referred to
above were brought under tax net within the competence of State Legislature. However, still the
basic constraints remain that the State/legislation does not have a power to levy tax on any
transaction by extending the meaning of sale beyond the province/provisions of the Sale of Goods
Act, 1930 except to the extent the provision has been made under Clause (29A) of Article 366.
(C) Concept of price in a taxable sale
52. Another group of decisions which were referred to by the learned Counsel for the parties related
to issues where the question has arisen what can be included and what cannot be included in the
sale price ordinarily, which can form part of turnover from transactions of sale of goods, and can be
subject to tax.
53. In George Oakes (Private) Ltd. v. State of Madras , it was held that "the sales tax charged from
the buyer becomes part of price paid by the buyer and it is immaterial that the sales tax is shown
separately from the price and making of such provision is not ultra vires".
54. The principle was reiterated in George Oakes (Private) Ltd. and Addison & Co. (Pvt.) Ltd. v.
State of Madras . It was stated in that case that "there is no reason why the whole amount paid to
seller by the purchaser should not be treated consideration for sale".

55. In Government of Andhra Pradesh v. Guntur Tobaccos Ltd. , the assessee was carrying on the
business of re-drying raw tobacco entrusted to it by its customers. The redried raw tobacco was
returned to supplier wrapped in water proof package. It was contended that charges by the redrier
be split into two, viz., the remuneration for job-work and sale of packing materials on which sales
tax is leviable. The court rejected the contention and said:
In the absence of any evidence from which contract to sell 'packing material' for a
price might be inferred, the use of 'packing materials' by the Company must be
regarded as part of execution of contract for redrying and the fact that the tobacco
delivered by the constituent was taken away with the 'packing material' will not
justify an inference that there was an intention to sell the 'packing material'.
56. In Hindustan Sugar Mills Ltd. v. State of Rajasthan , the question arose about the price content
of a sale of cement which was subject to Cement Control Order, 1967. The Control Order had devised
that no dealer could sell cement at a price exceeding Rs. 214.65 per metric tonne "free on rail,
destination railway station" plus the excise duty paid thereon. The assessee despatched cement to
the purchasers, prepared invoices showing "free on rail destination railway station" price of the
cement despatched, added to it the amount representing excise duty and packing charges and then
deducted from that amount, the railway freight to be paid by the purchasers. The assessee did not
charge in the invoices sales tax on the amount of railway freight, but in order to provide against a
possible claim which might be made by the sales tax authorities, the assessee claimed by way of
deposit an amount "towards contingent liability of sales tax on railway freight to be paid" by the
purchasers. The question arose whether the amount receivable from the buyers for the purchases
towards free on rail destination railway station price in the invoices forms the part of sale price so
that it can be made taxable turnover in view of the Control Order. The court negatived the
contention of the assessee that freight was payable by the purchaser and the delivery of goods and
transfer of title in goods was complete as soon as the goods were despatched and delivered to the
carrier. That was so because under the Control Order, the goods were to be delivered free on rail
destination. Therefore, the amount of freight formed the part of sale price. The court held:
The only relevant question needs to be considered is as to what is the amount payable
by the purchaser to the dealer as consideration for the sale . It is not intended to
apply to a case where the cost of freight is part of the price but the dealer chooses to
split up the price and claim the amount of freight as a separate item in the invoice.
57. In Central Wines v. Special Commercial Tax Officer [1987] 65 STC 48 57 (SC), the same principle
was applied by holding that sales tax charged to purchaser in bill but shown separately is part of the
"turnover" within the meaning of the definition of "turnover" in Section 2(s) of the A.P. General
Sales Tax Act, 1957. The court said:
The amount of money which goes from the pocket of the purchaser to the pocket of
the dealer as a condition or consideration for the passing of the property in the goods
is thus the sale price and not the tax.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 12Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
58.In coming to this conclusion, the court followed its earlier decision in 58 George bakes Private
Ltd.s case .
59. In Mc Dowell & Company Limited v. Commercial Tax Officer , the question arose about
computation of taxable turnover of liquor manufacturer. The appellant-assessee company was
carrying on the business of sale of Indian liquors in their outlets established in the State of U.P. The
sale of liquor from its dealer was arranged by making condition precedent for the wholesale buyers
to pay the excise duty directly to the Excise Department or to the State exchequer for obtaining
distillery passes for release of liquor and on presentation of the same the bills of sales or invoices
were used to be prepared by the distillery showing the price of liquor but excluding excise duty. The
assessee contended that when the excise duty does not come into the common till of the assessee
and it does not become part of the running capital, it does not constitute turnover. This contention
was not accepted by the Supreme Court finding that the incidence of excise duty is directly relatable
to manufacture. Payment of excise duty is the primary and exclusive obligation of the manufacturer
and is a condition precedent to the removal of the liquor from the distillery. So when payment is
made under a contract or arrangement by any other person, or when under a prior agreement, the
legal liability of the manufacturer-dealer for payment of excise duty is satisfied by the purchaser by
direct payment to the Excise Authorities or to the State exchequer, it would amount to meeting of
the obligation of the manufacturer and nothing more. According to the normal commercial practice,
excise duty should have been reflected in the bill either as merged in price or being shown
separately. In the hands of the buyer the cost of liquor is what is charged by the
appellant-manufacturer under its bill together with excise duty which the buyer has directly paid on
seller's account. Excise duty though paid by the purchaser to meet the liability of the appellant, is
thus a part of the consideration for the sale and is includible in the turnover of the appellant.
60. Lastly, reference was made in this connection to Neyveli Lignite Corporation Ltd. v. Commercial
Tax Officer, Cuddalore . This was a case in which the Revenue has sought to include in taxable
turnover of the assessee, the subsidy paid by the State to the manufacturer of fertiliser under an
administrative scheme by the Government of India to ensure that no hardship is caused to the
manufacturer and sufficient supplies of fertilisers were available. The question arose before the
court whether retention price received by the appellant in view of subsidy on fertiliser was part of
sale price and has to be included in turnover. It found on considering the scheme of the subsidy and
other factors that the subsidy cannot be treated as a part of the sale price because the subsidy and
the price were independent of each other. The court enunciated the principle as under:
It is that sale consideration, whether in cash or otherwise, which is receivable in
respect of sales made by the dealer which can possibly form part of the turnover of a
dealer. It is that sum which can be legitimately regarded as forming part of the
aggregate amount for which the goods have been bought or sold. The sum has to be
paid either by the purchaser or on his behalf by some other person. Any sum received
de hors the contract of sale from another entity, whether it be the Government or
anyone else, cannot be regarded as being an amount which would form part of the
sale price on which tax is payable.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 13Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
61. In coming to this conclusion, the court has distinguished its earlier decision in E. I. D. Parry (I)
Ltd. v. Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes [2000] 117 STC 457 (SC).
62. In all these cases whole amounts chargeable, whether directly as a part of sale price or by
splitting the sale price into different heads, remained the amount payable by the purchaser to the
seller under an agreement to sell, were considered to be part of the sale price and where the amount
paid to seller was beyond the scope of agreement to sell it was held to be not part of the price
component of "sale of goods" and not taxable.
63. However, none of the cases laid down that the tax on sale of goods under entry No. 54 can be
levied on something not chargeable from purchaser by the seller, parties to contract, by considering
it to be a price, if price is taken to be measure of tax to which rate of tax is to be applied.
64. From the aforesaid discussion, the principle which can be well-settled is ; firstly that the term
"sale of goods" in entry 54, List II has the same meaning as sale defined under the Sale of Goods Act,
1930 and that the State Legislature cannot enlarge the meaning of sale so as to tax a transaction
which is not sale within the meaning of Act of 1930. Clause (29A) in Article 366 gave extended
meaning to "tax on sale or purchase of goods" to include certain transactions within its ambit which
had otherwise been held to be not falling within precincts of sale of goods as discussed above.
However, beyond such extended meaning, the principle still remains the same that the term sale of
goods in entry 54, List II has the same meaning as under the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 and it
envisages within it four essential elements namely (i) parties competent to contract, (ii) mutual
assent, (iii) a thing, absolute or general property in which is transferred from seller to buyer, (iv)
price in money paid or promised.
65. Thus "price" paid or promised to be paid, whether under agreement express or implied when
price is regulated under price control orders is an essential component of taxing event for imposing
tax on the sale of goods. Whether the price is fixed under price control order or the parties are
forced to transact at the controlled price of the commodity, it does not lose its character of a
transaction by agreement so as to go beyond the purview of sale, so long as some element of
mutuality is there.
66. In this connection, the counsel for the State have placed reliance on certain decisions where the
price fixed under certain statutes for transacting the particular goods has been held to be lawful
basis for purpose of levy of tax.
67. The first case referred to us is State of Orissa v. Utkal Distributors (P.) Ltd. . The said case had
arisen under the Orissa Sales Tax Act, 1947. In the case before the Supreme Court the assessee was a
controlled stock-holder of iron and steel under the Iron and Steel Control Order, 1956 and as such it
was not entitled to charge a price higher than that fixed by the Government of India. It was
contended that the Central sales tax realised by the assessee from its customers was not part of the
price charged by it, and therefore, it did not fall within the definitions of "sale price" and "taxable
turnover".
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 14Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
68. Reliance was placed on Iron and Steel Control Order, 1956 read with the notification that higher
price than fixed by the Government of India cannot be charged. The court opined that:
the condition and the fact that the controlled stock-holder was not entitled to charge
a price higher than that fixed by the Government of India, that the valuable
consideration for the sale was the price fixed by the Government of India which did
not include the Central sales tax which the customer had to pay to the assessee as a
controlled stock-holder. The court further held the fact that the price which the
stock-holder was entitled to charge was statutorily fixed and the stock-holder was not
entitled to and did not charge more are sufficient to enable us to come to the
conclusion that the Central sales tax paid under the provisions of the Iron and Steel
Control Notification did not form part of the price paid by the customer to the
assessee.
69. As a result, the rate of tax came to be related to what could properly constitute price component
of sale in view of the provisions of the Price Control Order. This case is more akin to K. L Johar's
case [1965] 16 STC 213 (SC), in which in respect of the second sale under a hire-purchase
agreement, the court confined the levy of tax to that part of amount which could properly be related
as consideration for transfer of property in goods by excluding that part of amount which properly
be said to be charged by the financier from the buyer as hire for use of such goods before property in
them actually passes to the buyer.
70. This case is an authority about what can be or cannot be considered as part of price component
of sale. But it does not lay down that rate of tax can be applied to any such amount as measure which
is not the component of taxable sale as price.
71. The next decision relied on by the learned Additional Advocate-General is Indian Steel & Wire
Products Ltd. v. State of Madras . As discussed above while considering the decision in Vishnu
Agencies (Pvt) Ltd. v. Commercial Tax Officer [1978] 42 STC 31 (SC) : AIR 1978 SC 449, in which
this judgment has been approved, the fact that the price has been fixed under a Control Order and
dealer was under an obligation to sell the goods at controlled price, does not take away from it, the
character of an agreement voluntarily arrived at for transfer of property in goods and the transaction
is subject to levy of tax on sale of goods under the Madras General Sales Tax Act.
72. However, this case also does not concern the question where the turnover which is sought to be
taxed is not the aggregate of the sale price actually received or receivable by the dealer under the
Control Order but where the tax is sought to be levied on a price which may be charged from the
buyer by a subsequent seller.
73. The next decision which is relied on by the Revenue in this connection is Food Corporation of
India v. State of Kerala . It was also a case of compulsory or statutory sale, the purchase of
foodgrains by the Food Corporation of India pursuant to levy orders issued under Section 3 of the
Essential Commodities Act. However, this judgment, in our opinion, is of little value for deciding the
controversy that has been raised before us.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 15Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
74. The question of compulsory sale in various provisions of the statute by mutual agreement on
number of issues other than price is not totally ruled out, has been set at rest by the Supreme Court
in its Constitutional Bench decision in the case of Vishnu Agencies (Pvt) Ltd. .
75. Lastly, reliance was placed on Collector of Customs, Bombay v. Pecific Exports . It relates to the
valuation of goods for the purpose of levy of excise duty under the Central Excise Act, 1944 where ad
valorem duty is leviable. Section 4(1A) of the Act of 1944 ordained to levy ad valorem duty of excise
at MRP printed on the package which was considered to be valuation of goods manufactured on
which excise duty became leviable. In the case before the Supreme Court, the commodity in question
was aluminium rods, price of which was fixed vide Aluminium Control Order. While the Central
Excise Act provided that where the price is fixed under any statutory provision that has to be taken
as the price for the purpose of valuing the goods for the purpose of levy of excise duty. The Excise
Authorities have sought to levy the duty on higher amount by adding to maximum retail price the
extra amount charged by the assessee. The assessee has urged that excess amount was charged by
him for the job-work done by the assessee. He has contended that when statute ordained what shall
be value of goods for the purpose of levy of duty, the amount actually charged by the assessee cannot
be relevant. The court agreed with the contention of the assessee that by virtue of the proviso to
Section 4A, a legal fiction has been created that the price fixed under the Control Order has to be
taken as normal value of goods.
76. It is urged that by parity of reason, in the instant case, the price fixed by the notification dated
18th October, 1997 can be taken as the normal price of the sale by wholeseller to retailers in the case
of drugs and medicines.
77. Obviously, the element of determination of price element of a sale transaction is absent in the
case of levy of excise duty on goods manufactured by any manufacturer. The levy of excise duty may
be on the value of goods or may be fixed according to quantity of goods. In cases where the levy is ad
valorem, it is within the domain of the legislative authority to provide for the guidelines how the
value of the goods which is conceptual value subject to duty is to be determined. Since for the
purpose of determining the value of goods manufactured, for providing base for levy of excise duty
was statutorily provided, there was no room for picking other criterion for determining the value of
goods for the purpose of levy of excise duty.
78. The nature of duty of excise is entirely different from nature of tax on sale of goods.
79. At this stage, it is apposite to notice distinction between levy of tax envisaged under entry 84 of
Union List and entry 54 of State List. Entry 84 of Union List speaks about subject "Duties of excise
on tobacco and other goods manufactured or produced in India". On the other hand, entry 54 speaks
of tax on purchase or sale of goods. Subject of duties of excise is goods which are manufactured in
India, but not the transaction of goods. But subject of tax under entry 54 of State List is "sale" and
not the goods as such. Expression goods signify that it relates to sale of movable property and not of
immovables, which expression "sale" simplicitor would have included. For the purpose of entry 54
"sale" has been held to have the same meaning as it has under the Sale of Goods Act. That makes
conceptual distinction between the nexus that a measure for levying duty of excise can have with
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 16Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
subject of tax and the nexus which a measure of levy of tax on sale of goods has to have with its
subject sale. Duty of excise is levied on goods manufactured and value of goods, which provide
means of such duty is a conceptual value, which can be devised by Legislature by different
methodology.
80. In the case of sale, price is essence for which goods are transacted, concept of value of goods
does not enter into consideration.
81. The criterion relevant for levy of duty of excise cannot ipso facto apply to an impost subject of
which is a completed sale of goods property in which passes for a price paid or payable by the buyer
to the seller who are parties to transaction whether by overt agreement or implied agreement under
regulatory provision of statute and price is an essential component of the subject of tax. For that
purpose, the decision is not of much assistance for deciding the controversy before us.
82. The other decisions which have been referred to by the learned Counsel for the Revenue are (i)
A. G. Varadarajulu v. State of Tamil Nadu . The decision relates dealing with Stridhan. The case has
hardly any relevance to the controversy raised in this case. So also the decision rendered by the
Supreme Court in (ii) H. H. Maharajadhiraj Madhav Rao Jivaji Rao Scindia Bahadur v. Union of
India , which concerns the abolition of privy purses, does not offer any assistance in deciding the
controversy raised before us.
83. In the like way, the learned Counsel for the Revenue has referred to an unreported judgment by
this Court rendered by a learned single Judge in Purohit Swaroop Narain v. State of Rajasthan S. B.
C. Writ Petition No. 40 of 1968, decided on September 24, 1970. It was a case arising under the
Rajasthan Land Reforms and Resumption of Jagir Act, 1952 seeking a mandamus for implementing
and executing an order passed by the Khudkast Commissioner in favour of the petitioner. We see no
relevance of the said judgment throwing any light to the controversy raised in this case.
Machinery provision to have nexus with taxing event
84. It is a settled principle that the Legislature has more room for flexibility in providing machinery
for computation and recovery of tax validly imposed. Equally well-settled is that such machinery
provision must have a nexus with subject of tax.
85. In State of Bombay v. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala AIR 1957 SC 699, the question was considered
by the Supreme Court while examining the validity of tax imposed on prize and betting under the
Bombay Lotteries and Prize Competitions Control and Tax Act, 1948. The validity has been
challenged on multiple grounds. Inter alia it was contended since tax was to be imposed on total
collections from State of Bombay by the promoters of such prizes and lotteries, hence it was a tax on
trade or business under entry 60 of the Seventh Schedule and not a tax on betting and gambling
under entry 62.
86. While upholding the validity of the Act, by holding that it is a legislation on topic falling under
entry 62, viz., betting and gambling, the tax imposed by such statute would be tax on betting and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 17Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
gambling under entry 62, repelled the argument that the levy is a tax on trade because it provides
collection of tax from promoters of such prizes or lotteries on total amount of entry fee received by
them. The court said:
To collect the tax from the promoters is not to tax the promoters but is a convenient
way of imposing the tax on betting and gambling and indirectly taxing the gamblers
themselves.
87. In the context of the excise duty, the matter was considered by the Supreme Court in R.C. Jall
Parsi v. Union of India . The question was whether the excise duty which is leviable on the
manufacture of goods could be collected from the consignee of the goods. The court said:
Excise duty is primarily a duty on the production or manufacture of goods produced
or manufactured within the country. It is an indirect duty which the manufacturer or
producer passes on to the ultimate consumer, that is, its ultimate incident will always
be on the consumer. Therefore, subject always to the legislative competence of the
taxing authority, the said tax can be levied at convenient stage so long as the
character of the impost, that is, it is a duty on the manufacture or production, is not
lost. The method of collection does not affect the essence of the duty, but only relates
to the machinery of collection for administrative convenience. Whether in a
particular case, the tax ceases to be in essence an excise duty, and the rational
connection between the duty and the person on whom it is imposed ceased to exist, is
to be decided on a fair construction of the provisions of a particular Act.
88. The court found that the machinery providing for collection of duty from the consignee, had
such nexus with subject of tax, viz., goods manufactured in India and therefore the duty collected
from the consignee does not lose its character as excise duty payable on manufacture of goods.
89. It may be noticed that it was also a case in which the taxing event was one which did not change
with the consignment of goods and the levy was directly connected with the taxing event namely, the
manufacture of the goods by the manufacturer or producer though it was ultimately collected from
the consignee to whom ultimately the goods were delivered at the destination. The measure of tax to
which rate of tax was to be applied remained the value of the goods manufactured and was not
divorced from the "taxing subject" namely, the goods manufactured.
90. Again the matter came before the Supreme Court in Khyerbai Tea Co. Ltd. v. State of Assam . It
concerned the levy of tax relating to entry 56 of List II namely tax on goods and passenger carried by
road or inland waterways. In exercise of its powers, the State of Assam has enacted the Assam
Taxation (On Goods Carried by Road or on Inland Waterways) Act, 1961. The liability to pay tax on
carriage of tea was placed on producer of the tea. In some cases, the tax was recovered even before it
was carried. The provision was challenged being ultra vires to the legislative competence of the State
under entry 56 of List II on the ground that the tax is imposed before the occurrence of the event
namely actual carriage of the goods by waterways. The court said that Section 3(1) of the Assam Act
in terms expressly makes the carriage of goods the taxable event, and Section 3(2) makes the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 18Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
producer liable to pay the tax only on goods carried. If the goods produced in the tea garden are not
carried, there is no occasion to pay the tax. That being so, the fact that the Legislature has adopted
the machinery of making the purchaser responsible for the payment of the tax and liable for it in
that sense cannot introduce any element of legislative incompetence which would vitiate the statute.
91. However, the court observed that when the Legislature constructs a machinery for the recovery
of the taxes which is within its competence to impose, the said machinery should have some rational
or intelligent connection with the tax. In the absence of rational nexus between the purchaser and
the tax on goods carried, it may be open to a citizen to contend that the tax is not one justified by
entry 56 and reiterated the principle set out in the case of R.C. Jall Parsi AIR 1962 SC 1281 that the
method of collection does not affect the essence of the duty but only relates to the machinery of
collection for administrative convenience. It reaffirmed that machinery provision too must retain
nexus to taxing event, viz., "goods carried".
92. The decision of the Supreme Court in Rai Ramkrishna v. State of Bihar was somewhat in the
same line. It also concerned the levy of tax on passenger or goods carried by road or Inland
waterways. The court said:
The expression 'carried by road or on inland waterways' is an adjectival clause
qualifying goods and passengers, that is to say, it is goods and passengers of the said
description that have to be taxed under this entry. Nevertheless, it is obvious that the
goods as such cannot pay taxes, and so, taxes levied on goods have to be recovered
from some persons, and these persons must have an intimate or direct connection or
nexus with the goods before they can be called upon to pay the taxes in respect of the
carried goods.
93. All these cases in this connection bring out two principles very clearly. Firstly that power to tax
on a particular subject must emanate from the provisions of the Constitution. Secondly, the
machinery provision for levy and collection of tax must be integrally connected and having nexus
with the subject of tax. Once the machinery provisions for levy and collection loses nexus with the
subject of tax, it may not be permissible for the Legislature to enact such a provision.
Nexus between taxing event and measure of tax:
94. Having examined the meaning of expression "sale or purchase of goods" in entry 54 of List II of
the Seventh Schedule and the concept of price component of sale, the next question arises about the
nature of imposition of tax on sale of goods.
95. In examining this issue, first principle that is to be kept in view is distinction between
authorisation of charge and machinery provision which made the implementation of charge
effective. In the oft-quoted words of the Lord Dunedin in Whitney v. Inland Revenue Commissioner
[1926] AC 37:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 19Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
Now there are three stages for imposition of a tax. There is a declaration of liability,
that is part of statute which determines what persons in respect of what properties
are liable. Next, there is the assessment. Liability does not depend on assessment,
that, ex hypothesi has already been fixed. But assessment particularises the exact
sum which a person is liable to pay. Lastly comes the method of recovery if the
person taxed does not voluntarily pay.
96. That is the proposition which has been quoted with approval by Federal Court in Chatturam v.
Commissioner of Income-tax [1947] 15 ITR 302 and time and again by the apex Court. Reference
may be made to Chatturam Horliram v. Commissioner of Income-tax and Harshad Shantilal Mehta
v. Custodian .
97. The first stage contains the law imposing charge that brings levy into existence and on coming
into force of a taxing statute it exists at all times. The second stage concerns quantification or
computation of sum which becomes determined ex-hypothesi on occurrence of taxing event and the
third stage concerns the payment recovery and collection of tax. It may be noticed that Article 265
not only requires that charge must be authorized by law but it also says collection too must be
authorised by law.
98. Apparently first stage concerns the substantive provision of charge which brings the tax into
existence. Provision relating to second and third stage are machinery provisions relating to
computation and collection of tax.
99. This also brings to fore distinction in construing charging provision of a taxing statute on the
one hand and machinery provision relating to computation and collection of tax that stands
determined ex hypothesi on occurrence of taxing event. The decided cases in this connection are to
be viewed in that light.
100. While essentials of charging provisions are to identify the subject, viz., person, property or
transaction to be taxed, person who to be made liable, rate at which tax is to be levied, which inheres
in it the measure to which rate is to be applied so that liability can stand determined ex-hypothesi on
occurrence of taxing event without any hiatus. Computation and collection may take place later on.
Charge having been clearly authorised, the machinery for computation and modes of recovery can
be provided by Legislature in its discretion at convenient stage and place. However, charging
provision must strictly conform to the subject on which legislation is authorised by the Constitution
to impose tax.
101. The Federal Court in re The Central Provinces and Berar Sales of Motor Spirit and Lubricants
Taxation Act, 1938, [1938] 1 STC 1 : AIR 1939 FC 1, found it to be quite complex to arrive at the true
nature of "tax on sale of goods" not only in distinguishing it from a duty of excise but also from the
"turnover tax" or "sales tax". In delineating the distinction, Sulaiman J. in his opinion said that tax
on sale of goods necessarily must be a tax imposed at the time of sale of goods.

102. In Province of Madras v. Boddu Paidanna & Sons [1942] 1 STC 104 (FC) : AIR 1942 FC 33,
while considering the difference between sales tax and the excise duty, considering the nature of
question of excise duty, the court said:
...There is in theory nothing to prevent the Central Legislature from imposing a duty
of excise on a commodity as soon as it comes into existence, no matter what happens
to it afterwards, whether it be sold, consumed, destroyed or given away. A taxing
authority will not ordinarily impose such a duty, because it is much more convenient
administratively to collect the duty as is in the case of most of the Indian Excise Acts
when the commodity leaves the factory for the first time, and also because the duty is
intended to be an indirect duty which the manufacturer or producer is to pass on to
the ultimate consumer, which he could not do if the commodity had, for example,
been destroyed in the factory itself. It is the fact of manufacture which attracts the
duty, even though it may be collected later ; and we may draw attention to the Sugar
Excise Act in which it is specially provided that the duty is payable not only in respect
of sugar which is issued from the factory but also in respect of sugar which is
consumed within the factory.
103. While considering the issue whether excise duty and the sales tax are the taxes overlapping and
two taxes cannot be levied on the manufacture of the goods, it opined that the two taxes are
different. The Federal Court said : "The two taxes, the one levied upon manufacturer in respect of
his goods, the other upon a vendor in respect of his sales, may, as is there pointed out, in one sense
overlap. But in law there is no overlapping. The taxes are separate and distrinct impose. If in fact,
they overlap, that may be because the taxing authority, imposing a duty of excise, finds it convenient
to impose the duty at the moment when the excisable article leaves the factory or workshop for the
first time upon the occasion of its sale. But that method of collecting the tax is an accident of
administration : it is not of the essence of the duty of excise which is attracted by the manufacture
itself"
104. Applying the principle, it can be said that essence of tax on sale of goods is the sale itself.
105. The principle found approval of Privy Council in Governor-General in Council v. Province of
Madras [1945] 1 STC 135 : AIR 1945 PC 98.
106. The question again came up for consideration before the Supreme Court in Sri Venkateswara
Rice, Ginning and Groundnut Oil Mill Contractors Co. v. State of Andhra Pradesh , in which the
matter arose under the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act, 1956. The court emphasised that
charge comes into existence as soon as taxing event takes place. That is not postponed later. It was
said in relation to levy of purchase tax:
...Hence the turnover relating to the purchases in question became charged with the
liability to pay tax as soon as those purchases were made by the assessee-millers. This
means that as soon as a first miller purchases groundnut the turnover relating to that
purchase, the question of exemption apart, becomes liable to tax.

107. A five-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Ganga Sugar Corporation Ltd. v. State of Uttar
Pradesh , has considered the aspect in some detail. The question has arisen in a group of appeals
arising from a common demand for tax by the State of Uttar Pradesh as to the basis of levy once a
transaction is held to be a transaction of sale. The court said, Tax on sale or purchase must be on the
occurrence of a taxing event of sale transaction.
108. The apex Court in Govind Saran Ganga Saran v. Commissioner of Sales Tax on analysing
Article 265, has said that:
The components which enter into the concept of a tax are well-known. The first is the
character of the imposition known by its nature which prescribes the taxable event
attracting the levy, the second is a clear indication of the person on whom the levy is
imposed and who is obliged to pay the tax, the third is the rate at which the tax is
imposed, and the fourth is the measure or value to which the rate will be applied for
computing the tax liability.
109. Obviously, all the four components of a particular concept of tax has to be inter related having
nexus with each other. Having identified tax event, the tax cannot be levied on a person
unconnected with event ; nor the measure or value to which rate of tax can be applied can be
altogether unconnected with the subject of tax, though the contours of the same may not be
identical.
110. Union of India v. Bombay Tyre International Ltd. , is a landmark decision in illuminating the
trinity of expression the subject of tax, the measure of tax and nexus between the two. The decision
arose in the context of Central Excises and Salt Act. The controversy was what should include in the
measure of computation of liability and what fell outside the scope of measure to be excluded from
consideration. The court referred to a large number of decisions of different courts, including some
of the decisions we have referred to above. It approved the principle succinctly stated in Seervai's
Constitutional Law:
Another principle for reconciling apparently conflicting tax entries follows from the
fact that a tax has two elements : the person, thing or activity on which the tax is
imposed, and the amount of the tax. The amount may be measured in many ways ;
but decided cases establish a clear distinction between the subject-matter of a tax and
the standard by which the amount of tax is measured. These two elements are
described as the subject of a tax and the measure of a tax.
111. The court also approved that the measure of tax though not always essential but often a relevant
consideration to judge the nature of levy. The court quoted with approval following passage from
R.R. Engineering Co. v. Zila Parishad, Bareilly AIR 1980 SC 1088:
It may be, and is often so, that the tax on circumstances and property is levied on the
basis of income which the assessee receives from his profession, trade, calling or
property.....Therefore, while determining the nature of a tax, though the standard on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 22Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
which the tax is levied may be a relevant consideration, it is not a conclusive
consideration.
112. The court while commended greater freedom in adopting measure of the tax to be assessed by
its own standard and administrative convenience and other factors may influence the stage at which
the levy may be collected and there may be deviation in contours of measure of tax, but did not
countenance it to be divorced from the nature of tax. The court said : "Any standard which
maintains a nexus with the essential character of the levy can be regarded as a valid basis for
assessing the measure of the levy."
113. With these premise the court found that while nature of an excise is indicated by the fact that it
is imposed in respect of manufacture or production of an article, the point at which it is collected is
not determined by the point of time when manufacture is completed but will rest on consideration
of administrative convenience and that generally it is collected when the article leaves the factory for
the first time.
114. Identifying the first sale by manufacturer as stage and point when the levy is to be collected was
found to have a nexus with levy of excise duty. Price and sale are related terms and have a definite
connotation. The value of excisable article is a conceptual term, which concept can be visualised by
the Legislature with reference to price charged by the manufacturer at first sale in terms of Section
4. Thus, measure of excise duty was not restricted to manufacturing cost plus manufacturing profit
Wholesale cash price at which the article is sold or in the absence of such statute at a price at which
it is sold or capable of being sold by the manufacturer at the time of removing from factory site.
115. Thus, the court found that measure of levy is "value of excisable goods" which had direct nexus
with subject of tax. Value unlike price is a conceptual value and the Legislature has unfolded its
concept of value by relating it to the price at which excisable goods are sold at factory gate. Price and
sale are definite terms having a definite connotation and are not a conceptual values.
116. However, the court empathically denied contention of revenue to include post removal expenses
in the measure of excise duty. It said:
Accordingly, we hold that pursuant to the old Section 4(a) the value of an excisable
article for the purpose of the excise levy should be taken to be the price at which the
excisable article is sold by the assessee to a buyer at arm's length in the course of
wholesale trade at the time and place of removal.....
Where the excisable article or an article of the like kind and quality is not sold in
wholesale trade at the place of removal, that is, at the factory gate, but is sold in the
wholesale trade at a place outside the factory gate, the value should be determined as
the price at which the excisable article is sold in the wholesale trade at such place,
after deducting there from the cost of transportation of the excisable article from the
factory gate to such place.....
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 23Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
117. In coming to this conclusion, the court referred to the case of Atic Industries Ltd. v. H.H. Dave,
Assistant Collector of Central Excise and found the principle to be not in derogation of the principle
enunciated in the case at hand. Any element which augmented the price rise leaving factory gate
could not be the basis of excise duty, as it will be removed from the character of excise duty, is the
clear ratio emerging from Bombay Tyre's case AIR 1984 SC 420.
118. This principle was further succinctly stated by the apex Court in a very recent decision in
Commissioner of Central Excise v. Chhata Sugar Co. Ltd. . Considering the provisions of the Central
Excise Act, 1944, the court said:
Section 3 of the Central Excise Act, 1944 is a charging section, which creates the
liability to pay the excise duty on the goods produced or manufactured in India and
the said Sub-section clearly indicates the nature and character of the duty, namely,
that it is a tax on production and manufacture of goods, while Section 4 is in the
nature of machinery provision and, therefore, anything said therein must be read so
as to carry out the basic concept of excise duty.
119. It was a case in which Revenue sought to include in assessable value of excisable goods,
administrative charges collected on sale of molasses under the U.P. Sheera Niyantaran Adhiniyam,
1964. Rejecting the contention of Revenue, the court said that administrative charges in question
were distinct, separate and in addition to price of molasses which price is statutory price fixed under
the U.P. Act and is not relatable to taxing event identified in charging section.
120. In this case also, we are concerned with somewhat like situation relating to charge of levy on
sale under Price Control Order.
121. It is discernible that in cases where the taxing event is one, e.g. in the case of excise duty the
collection of tax remains a tax on manufacture of goods and can be collected from a person who has
a nexus with the goods which are subject of tax. However, in the matter of levy of excise duty, the
measure of tax has to be connected with the subject of tax, viz., the goods manufactured. The
measure of tax must have nexus with the goods so manufactured in some way, in value. So long as
the measure is related to the goods to be taxed whether in value or weight, the levy does not lose its
character as a tax on manufacture of goods, the taxable events occur on goods coming into existence
as a result of manufacturing event, and unless such goods are used as input in another produce, it
does not result in a second taxing event. The second taxing event may arise only in case there is a
manufacture of new article in which the earlier manufactured article may be used as raw material.
Therefore, at any stage tax is collected as is on the event of manufacture integrally connected with
the taxing event and not divorced from it.
122. Similarly, in the case of providing machinery for making the levy of tax on passenger or goods
carried through road or inland waterways is a single taxing event and collecting machinery should
have relative nexus with it. For levying tax on one taxing event, it cannot be connected with another
taxing event.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 24Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
123. The position of tax on sale of goods may be examined in this light. The subject of tax being sale,
measure of tax for the purpose of quantification must retain nexus with "sale" which is subject of
tax. As noticed above, tax on sale of goods, is tax on vendor in respect of his sales and is
substantially a tax on sale price. The vendor or buyer cannot be taxed de hors the subject of tax that
is sale by the vendor or purchase by the buyer. The four essential ingredients of any transaction of
sale of goods include the price of the goods sold, therefore, in any taxing event of sale, which
becomes subject-matter of tax, price component of such sale is an essential part of the taxing event.
Therefore, the question does arise whether a particular taxing event of sale could be subjected to tax
at the prescribed rate to be measured with such price which is not the component of the transaction
of sale, which has attracted the sales tax.
124. So far as persons connected with sale of goods is concerned they are buyers and purchasers,
common parties to sale. The person who can be identified for collecting the tax may be either of
them. The tax may be levied on either the seller or the purchaser. Measure of tax may be related to
goods. The other component of sale is the price of goods sold. Either of can provide measure of tax.
But measure vis-a-vis goods must be of goods which are subject to taxable transaction and so also if
price of goods is to be measure to which rate is applied, it must be constituent of such sale which
becomes taxable, or relatable to compliment of such sale.
125. Unlike excise duty, where levy is on goods manufactured, in the case of tax on sale of goods, the
price cannot be considered as a conceptual idea, which can be defined independently. Price and sale
are not conceptual ideas but carry definite legal connotation. Price as defined in Sale of Goods Act is
essential part of a completed sale of goods which become subject of tax. As the principle is
well-settled that tax cannot be levied on any transaction which is not sale in accordance with Sale of
Goods Act by creating a legal fiction, it is also not permissible to divorce price as a measure of tax on
sale by creating a legal fiction.
126. The question of point of collection of tax and measure of tax is not the samething.
127. If the tax is to be collected from the seller, it will be tax on the subject sale and the seller who
has nexus with such taxing event is the person who is made liable. If it is to be collected from buyer,
it is termed as purchase tax in the hands of buyer and the taxing event is the "purchase of goods".
The purchaser has a link with goods purchased by him and also with price paid or payable by him to
the seller. But he cannot be subjected to purchase tax with reference to price at which he will sell the
goods subsequently. That may be subject of another taxing event of sale, if permissible under law.
Measure of tax on sale of goods generally
128. In Andhra Sugars Ltd. v. State of Andhra Pradesh , the case concerned the challenge to levy of
sales tax under the Andhra Pradesh Sugarcane Regulation of Supply and Purchase Act. The tax was
levied on the purchase of sugarcane as per the weights of the goods purchased. One of the
contentions raised before the Supreme Court challenging its validity was that the tax must be levied
with reference to the turnover only and it cannot be levied with reference to the weight of the goods
purchased. The contention was rejected by the Supreme Court by saying.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 25Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
...Where the purchase tax is levied on a dealer, the levy is usually with reference to his turnover,
which normally means the aggregate of the amounts of purchase prices. But the tax need not
necessarily be levied on a dealer or by reference to his turnover. It may be levied on the occupier of a
factory by reference to the weight of the goods purchased by him.
129. However, where tax is to be measured in terms of price or in terms of weight or quantity of
goods sold, whether the measure can be different from the content of taxing event was not the
proposition laid.
130. It was observed in Ganga Sugar Corporation Ltd.'s case :
...It is a superstition, cultivated by familiarity, to consider that all sales tax must
necessarily have nexus with the price of the commodity. Of course, price as basis is
not only usual but also safe to avoid uneven, unequal burdens, although it is
conceivable that a Legislature can regard prices which fluctuate frequently as too
impractical to tailor the purchase tax. It may even be, in rare cases, iniquitous to link
purchase tax with price, if more sensible bases can be found.
131. It was a case in which weight of the commodity was made the basis for levy of the tax. But, price
of goods was approved to be usual meaning of levy of tax on sale of goods. It does not deviate from
basic principle that a tax of any nature is determined ex hypothesi on occurrence of taxing event. Its
actual computation and collection takes place later on through the machinery provided. However,
the determination of charge ex hypothesi instantly on occurrence of taxing event which inheres into
it that measure of tax is integrally connected with occurrence of taxing event and is not postponed to
a later date.
132. Thus, primarily the rate of tax relates to measure of tax to come into existence simultaneous
with occurrence of taxing event. The machinery provisions relating to its quantification and
collection can take place later. Providing measure to which rate is to be applied is integrally
connected with charge itself.
133. Somewhat in like circumstances, the court had occasion to consider the ambit and scope of
legislative power of the State Legislature while imposing tax on sale of goods in Hotel Balaji v. State
of Andhra Pradesh [1993] 88 STC 98 (SC) : AIR 1993 SC 1048, wherein the court said:
So long as the levy retains the basic character of a tax on sale, the Legislature can levy
it in such mode or in such manner as it thinks appropriate.
134. In this connection, it is relevant for the present purposes to notice that in upholding the validity
of additional purchase tax on goods, when the goods manufactured by the buyer are sold outside
State was that the tax was related to purchase price, which was part of transaction of purchase and
not payable on price at which he shall be selling his goods. Therefore, it retained its character of tax
on purchase otherwise it would have become duty of excise on value of goods determined in terms of
price charged by manufacturer, when such sale was not subject of tax levied by State Legislature.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 26Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
Consideration of present case in the light of above principles:
135. Keeping in view the aforesaid principle, the final issue that begs an answer is whether tax on
sales by wholesalers to retailers with reference to price that may be chargeable under the law on
subsequent sale by retailer from end consumer retains the basic character of "tax on sale or
purchase of goods" which falls within the province of permissible tax under entry 54 of List II of the
Seventh Schedule.
136. In Ganga Sugar Corporation Ltd.'s case [1980] 45 STC 36 (SC); [1980] 1 SCC 223, the court
emphasised : the tax on sale or purchase must be on occurrence of taxing event of sale transaction.
While accepting that, price of the sale transaction is not necessarily the only criterion which may
form the basis of levy of tax but it opined that price as basis is not only usual but also safe to avoid
unequal, uneven burdens. The court also stated that it is common sense that the reliable standard is
the price although in regard to custom duties there are still items on which duties is levied on the
nature of goods rather than its value in money.
137. The issue which the court was considering was the levy of tax on sale of sugarcane and the court
found that weight of cane which has sucrose contents have a close nexus with price although
theoretically they may appear unconnected and consequently the levy of tax with reference to weight
of sugarcane was held to be a permissible hypothesis for determining the tax.
138. In the case of Hotel Balaji v. State of Andhra Pradesh [1993] 88 STC 98 (SC) : AIR 1993 SC
1048, levy of purchase tax at the last point sale within the State by a dealer/manufacturer who has
sold the goods manufactured by him in the course of inter-State trade and commerce, on the
purchase price of the raw materials, was the subject of challenge. The contention has been raised
before the Supreme Court that since tax was leviable in cases where the goods manufactured were
not sold in the State, it amounted to levy of excise duty on manufacture though named as purchase
tax. In holding that levy was essentially a tax on purchase of goods within the State, one of the
factors which weighed with the Supreme Court was that the levy was upon the purchase price of the
raw material and not upon the value of the manufactured products. That is to say when the tax was
levied at the transaction of purchase, notwithstanding it was leviable in case of goods manufactured
by the dealer and were sold in a manner not taxable within the State is nonetheless tax leviable at
purchase price and not on the value of the manufactured products. So it was held that the essential
character of tax on purchase was retained and consequently it did not lose its character as a tax on
purchase of goods. The court obviously indicated that in the case tax on sale, price on which
transaction took place and not the value of goods is relevant criterion to hold nexus between
measure of tax and the taxing event.
139. The position would have been different had the tax on taxable transaction of purchase would
have been levied with reference to price relatable to subsequent transaction of sale. In that event,
the price forming part of subsequent sale would have lost nexus with the transaction that become
taxable in the State.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 27Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
140. However, this case did not lay down the principle that where price is the measure to which rate
of tax can be applied, it can be something else than the price component of taxing event, whether
agreed by mutual consent or as regulated by statutes.
141. These cases give a clear picture that entry 54 of List II of the Seventh Schedule empowers the
State Legislature to impose and collect taxes on sale of goods. The measure to which tax rate is to be
applied must have a nexus to taxable event of sale and not divorced from it.
142. In the present case, there is no dispute about the fact that the subject of tax is a charge which
arises on completion of a transaction of sale by the manufacturer or distributor or wholesaler to the
retailer. It has all the ingredients of a sale within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act 1930
inasmuch as the sale of the drugs or medicines by the wholesaler to retailers is as a result of contract
entered into by the parties by mutual option in which property in drug is transferred from the seller
wholesaler in the present case to buyer retailer in the present case for a consideration which is
agreed to between the parties subject to the limits prescribed by the Control Order. However, mere
identification of subject of tax is not enough to complete the charge. It needs to necessarily
accompany with rate of tax to be applied to a measure having nexus to the subject of tax so that
liability stands determined ex hypothesi on occurrence of taxing event.
143. The question, therefore, which needs to be considered at this stage is whether the measure to
which rate of tax is to be applied on single point transaction of sale of any formulation by the
wholesaler to the retailer can be something notional which is not related to subject of tax or to say in
other words, whether MRP to be chargeable subsequent to taxing event by a retailer when he sells
the same goods to consumer can provide a basis which has a nexus with taxable event to provide a
valid measure to which rate of tax can be applied.
144. It may be noticed that in any of the cases to which reference has been made, the question really
did not fall for consideration whether there can be any other basis than the actual sale price or price
fixed for such sale by any statute or actual weight of the goods sold for measuring the tax on the
transaction of sale of goods in respect of any particular commodity or commodities. Nor it fell for
consideration that if the total turnover is considered to be measure to which rate of tax is to be
applied for determining the tax ex hyphothesi when the taxing event takes place the turnover could
be something other than aggregate of such sums which property can be included in price as
discussed above. In other words whether an artificial standard of measure to fix the taxable turnover
to which rate can be applied, can be adopted ?
145. The principal contention about the invalidating of the basis or the measure of tax envisaged
under Section 4A of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1994 as inserted, vide, Finance Act, 2004 is that
while it levies taxes on the sale transaction carried on by the manufacturer or wholesalers or
distributor the measure with which total turnover is to be determined is not part of the sale which
attracts tax but its premise is to be found on subsequent sale which, under the scheme of single
point tax is not exigible to tax at all. The MRP which a wholesaler can charge in respect of scheduled
formulations too is fixed by DPCO. In respect of scheduled formulations wholesaler is required to
leave at least 16 per cent margin in the MRP for the retailers and he is entitled to retain not more
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 28Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
than eight per cent profit on the purchase price. There being statutory prohibition against the
wholesalers to charge MRP from its buyer, the maximum retail price fixed on the packet has no
rational connection with the taxable sale effected by the wholesalers and which becomes
subject-matter of charge as a first point tax. In such event, there exists no nexus between the
measure of levy and subject of levy. The contention has some force.
146. The foregoing discussion leads to conclude that:
(i) Tax on "sale or purchase of goods" as subject of tax within the ambit of entry 54 of
State List has been construed to mean completed sale of goods as per the Sale of
Goods Act, 1930 which has four essential ingredients, viz., (1) Eligibility of contract;
(2) Mutual consent;
(3) Agreement to transfer in general property in any specified goods from seller to
buyer ; and (4) For a cash consideration or pricethat is paid or payable.
(ii) Tax is to be levied as soon as such completed transactions, which have all the
above ingredients, come into existence. It cannot be levied on a future transaction.
(iii) Price or consideration is an essential ingredients of any taxable transaction of
sale of goods. Vis-a-vis tax on sale of goods, what constitutes price components of
sale has received attention of courts and principle is settled that price components of
sale transaction is that total amount which is paid or becomes payable by the
purchaser to the seller of goods in pursuance of the contract of sale and it alone can
be termed as price of such sale which attracts charge.
(iv) Any sum de hors the contract of sale cannot be termed as price component of sale
transaction which becomes subject of tax.
(v) A transaction which has not taken place but may take place in future cannot be
subject of tax under entry 54 of List II of the Seventh Schedule though may become
subject of levy, when it takes place in fact.
147. In the context of meaning assigned to expression "sale of goods" or price or consideration
element of such "sale of goods" as taxable event, the conclusion that can fairly be reached is that for
the taxing event of sale, if the price is to be the basis for measuring tax, it must relate to actual
transaction of sale that becomes subject of tax and not to a different transaction that may take place
in future at a price. It amounts to determine fictionally the price element of completed sale which
becomes chargeable to tax with reference to price that may be chargeable different from paid or
promised to be paid and controlled by the statute for such subsequent transaction, which has not
come into being at all much less a completed transaction, more so in the case when charge is on
single point in a series of sales. Transaction is the foundation that determines the liability to tax the
completed sale at the point it becomes taxable and not the subsequent sale or sales in series of sales.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 29Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
Price as a constituent of sale is not a conceptual value but has a well defined legal connotation.
148. Accepting the contention of Revenue that the retail sale price likely to be received when such
transaction takes place is taken only as a basis to provide measure of levying tax on a completed
transaction between wholesalers and retailer would make it suffer from basic fallacy of importing
the composition of sale which has not come into existence to determine tax which is fixed as soon as
the taxable sale is completed,
149. While it appears attractive that levy is with reference to the sale consideration which may
ultimately be receivable by the retail seller of the drugs or pharmaceutical products from the end
consumer at the last point sale within the State, which can also be subject-matter of tax by the State
within its competence under entry 54, of List II, the apparent snag is that it imports levy of tax with
reference to a transaction which has not come into existence, and which cannot be subject of tax.
150. Section 4A of the Act of 1994 which projects itself as an exception to Section 4, creates a legal
fiction in respect of price of subject sale, on which rate of tax is to be applied but levy of tax remains
single point levy in a series of sales. Point of taxable sale remains the first point sale, i.e., from the
manufacturer/distributor or the wholesaler to the retailer. The tax is to be charged on turnover of
the assessment year in aggregate. The turnover is defined under Section 2(44) and taxable turnover
under Section 2(42) of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1994. For the taxable event that has occurred,
the amount received or receivable is assumed to be somewhat different than which is neither
received nor receivable and that amount which neither flows from the Drugs Price Control Order,
nor which flows from buyer to seller under the contract but is relatable to a transaction of sale by a
retailer which may not have come into existence. For the present, the price to which rate of tax is
sought to be applied to a sale by a wholesaler to a retailer is neither the price agreed upon by the
parties to the contract of taxable sale to which charge is attracted nor flows from the DCO under
which also, it is the price of formulation before end sale is to be determined within prescribed limits.
151. Section 4A deals with levy of tax on specified goods as may be notified in relation to which it is
required under some statutory provision to declare on the package thereof the retail price of such
goods. The commodities sold in packages is required under Section 39 of the Standard of Weight
and Measures Act, 1976 to declare on packaging the unit of weight, the weight of packed commodity
and sale price thereof. Similar provision may be operative for other commodities in terms of orders
issued under Essential Commodities Act, as is in the case of Drugs Price Control Order, 1995 with
which we are concerned.
152. Whether prices are to be fixed under statutes or by the manufacturer, in the absence of any
price fixation by controlling authority, the usual form of declaration is about MRP chargeable or
price not to exceed. It may be further qualified with expression "inclusive of all taxes" or "local taxes
extra". However, retail price declared on cover does not convey the price chargeable in respect of
inter-dealer sales, before stage is reached of sale to end consumer though it is obvious that such
inter-dealer price is bound to be less than the MRP so declared keeping in view profit margin of
intermediaries and other relevant factors. To illustrate the para 7 of the Drugs Price Control Order,
1995 provides the method of fixing retail price. It provides for considering trade margins and margin

of manufacture not exceeding 100 per cent in the case of indigenously manufactured scheduled
formulations and not exceeding 50 per cent in the case of imported formulations. The intermediary
traders margin is to play within the trade margin taken into account while fixing retail price under
para 7 of the Schedule Drugs para 19 for the postulates that trade margin for the retailer shall not be
less than 16 per cent of MRP extending excess component of it. While para 8 enable the Central
Government to fix MRP for Scheduled Drugs as per para 7 of the Order, para 9 provides for
determining ceiling price in case of Scheduled Drugs. Para 14 requires every manufacturer, importer
or distributor to display on the label of container of formulations and the minimum pack offered for
retail sale, the retail price with words "retail price not to exceed" preceding it as "local taxes extra"
succeeding it and "Under Government Control Price" on a red strip. Likewise, under para 15 every
manufacturer, importer or distributor of non-scheduled drugs is required to display a label of
container of formulations and minimum thereof offered for retail sale. The retail price of that
formulation in like manner as in the case of a schedule drug excepted "Under Government control
price" in red strip it must display in green strip, "Not under price control".
153. The display of MRP is primarily for consumer protection and to keep the trade margin in limit
in the case of scheduled drug.
154. In the case of scheduled drugs or non-scheduled drugs they are to reach the consumer at a price
not exceeding the retail price displayed on the container and package.
155. However, it is envisaged that manufacturer, distributor, importer or wholesaler does not sell the
drugs directly to consumers but makes their sales to retailers. Obviously, the price ingredient of
such sale is not the MRP published on package but less than it leaving room for trade margin. Such
margin limit is fixed in case of scheduled drugs by DPC itself. In non-scheduled formulations, it
depends purely within the domain of agreement between contracting parties, within MRP limit.
156. It will be relevant here to notice certain provisions of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1994 other
than the provisions of Section 4A and the provisions of Drugs Price Control Order, 1995 under
which the maximum retail price (MRP) is fixed.
The general scheme of charging provision of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1994:
157. The charging Section 4 ordains that the tax payable by a dealer under the Act of 1994, shall be at
single point in the series of sales by successive dealers, as may be prescribed and shall be levied at
such rates not exceeding fifty per cent on the taxable turnover, as may be notified by the State
Government in the Official Gazette. Thus, making clear that there is no multi-point tax within the
State and the tax is levied on the first point sale within the State in a series of sales and tax is leviable
at rate applied to aggregate of price received or receivable by the dealer on such sales.
158. Section 4A does not become workable unless read along with definition of turnover and taxable
turnover.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 31Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
159. The turnover and taxable turnover have been defined in Section 2(44) and 2(42) respectively
Sub-section (44) of Section 2 states that turnover means the aggregate amount received or
receivable by a dealer for sales as referred to in Clause (38) including the purchase price of the goods
which are subject to purchase tax under Section 11 of the Act.
160. Taxability under Section 4A too is on total turnover in case of goods notified under it. Unless,
the MRP as abated by rate prescribed in notification is to be taken to be "price" of the sale, the
provision does not become operative. The amount derived in terms of notification is not the
aggregate of amount received or receivable, nor it is price as defined under the Sale of Goods Act of
the completed sale which has become taxable, but an amount assumed to be a price received or
receivable for the taxable transaction.
The effect of single point levy:
161. Moreover the levy remains a single point levy under Section 4A. The tax- able turnover under
Sub-section (42) of Section 2 means that part of turnover which remains after deducting therefrom
the aggregate amount of the proceeds of sale of goods on which no tax is leviable under this Act;
which have been exempted from tax or which have suffered tax under this Act, subject to other
provisions of the Act; and which are taxable at a point of sale within the State subsequent to the sale
by the dealer and such sale is covered by a declaration as may be required under any provision of
this Act or the Rules made thereunder. Thus, making it clear that once stage is arrived where the
sale transaction becomes taxable, no tax becomes payable on subsequent sale transaction as from
the turnover of subsequent seller the transaction on which tax is paid has to be excluded. That is
usual characteristic of single point levy.
162. The effect of single point tax in a series of sale transaction is that sale subsequent to point of
sale chosen as subject of tax cannot be taxed is the opinion expressed by the apex Court in Sales Tax
Officer v. Timber & Fuel Corporation . At the relevant time, under the M. P. General Sales Tax Act
on sale of timber a single point tax was leviable. When the first point sale took place, it was taxable.
Subsequently, said sales were exempted retrospectively. Revenue authorities then sought to tax
subsequent sales that took place in M. P. The court rejected the contentions by holding that
subsequent sale when took place did not attract tax. Subsequent exemption of first sale cannot
automatically result in shifting of tax liability to subsequent sale. It was said:
...as the law stood at the relevant time, the sales of timber by the Madhya Pradesh
Forest Department were the first sales, which were not exempt from the levy of sales
tax. Hence when the taxing events took place, namely, when the sales in question
took place, the assessee was not liable to pay any tax in respect of those sales, as the
sales effected by him were second sales.
163. The admitted position is that the sales made by the wholesalers to the retailers are the first
point sales, within the State inviting the charge of tax under Section 4 and the taxable turnover of
the subsequent dealers, viz., the retailers or sub-retailers shall not include the turnover of sale of
goods which had already suffered tax at the hands of wholesaler at the first point sale. Without the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 32Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
aid of Section 4A, the tax would have been levied at the aggregate of sale price of the dealer through
the whole of the taxable period as is received by him or receivable by him from the buyer of his
goods under the contract of sale.
164. In the facts and circumstances of the case, what cannot be lost sight of is that price that may
become consideration as part of sale of scheduled formulation from wholesaler to retailer is also
controlled by Price Control Order.
The Scheme of Drugs Price Control Order, 1995:
165. The Drugs Price Control Order, 1995 (DPCO) issued under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955
deals with fixing of price for three different persons, viz., "manufacturer", the wholesaler and the
retailer. The manufacturer has been defined under paragraph 2(m) of the Order as any person who
manufactures a drug. The "wholesaler" under paragraph 2(y) means a dealer or his agent or a
stockiest appoint by a manufacturer or an importer for the sale of his drugs to a retailer, hospital,
dispensary, medical, educational or research institution purchasing bulk quantities of drugs.
Meaning thereby that wholesaler is one who sells drug in bulk quantity. The retailer under
paragraph 2(t) means a dealer carrying on the retail business of sale of drugs to customers.
Customer has not been defined but in the context it means the end consumer.
166. Para 3 of the Order empowers the Government with a view to regulate equitable distribution of
bulk formulation named in the First Schedule and maximum sale price at which bulk shall be sold.
In other words, the maximum price is fixed for the sale of bulk drugs named in First Schedule of the
order and in fixing the maximum price for bulk drug, the Government has to take into consideration
net worth or a return of 26 per cent of the capital employed by the manufacturer of the bulk drugs.
The selling price for the bulk drug is not to exceed maximum bulk price plus local tax, if any.
167. The retail price of a formulation needs determination under paragraph 7 of the Order and the
Government is empowered by order to fix the price in accordance with paragraph 7 of the Order to
be charged by a retailer. Where the maximum retail price is fixed as provided under paragraph 7 of
DPCO, para 19 provides for price that can be charged from a retailer by a wholesaler. It reads as
under:
19. Price of formulations sold to the dealer.(1) A manufacturer, distributor or
wholesaler shall sell a formulation to a retailer, unless otherwise permitted under the
provisions of this Order or any Order made thereunder, at a price equal to the retail
price, as specified by an Order or notified by the Government excluding excise duty, if
any, minus sixteen per cent thereof in the case of Scheduled drugs.
168. In other words, while MRP is fixed for the purpose that no retailer shall refuse to sell a drug to a
customer and shall not charge price exceeding MRP fixed under the Order plus local taxes, so also
maximum price is fixed above which goods will not be sold to retailers by ordaining that no
manufacturer, distributor or wholesaler shall fix the price exceeding 16 per cent less than the
maximum retail price. For example if the maximum retail price for a drug to be sold by a retailer to a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 33Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
customer is fixed at Rs. 100, the wholesaler, manufacturer, distributor or wholesaler shall not sell a
formulation to a retailer at a price exceeding Rs. 100-16 : Rs. 84. Thus, the maximum price at which
a wholesaler, distributor or manufacturer can sell the formulation to a retailer for further sale is also
necessarily fixed by the Drugs Price Control Order, 1995.
169. We have noticed above that even in cases where maximum rates are fixed or the retail price is
fixed under the Price Control Order by statute, the transaction does not lose its character of a
transaction of sale so long as there is some element of mutuality of voluntary consent is left. That is
to say, where a sale price is not to exceed a particular rate there is always room for contracting party
to agree for a price less than that; apart from the freedom of option to enter into a contract at all
always rest with the parties. Therefore, it is a misnomer to say that the maximum price is fixed only
for retailer and not for the sale by manufacturer, distributors or wholesalers to retailers. That being
the position, under the statute, the price component of sale transaction from a manufacturer,
distributor or wholesaler to retailer cannot be more than as provided under paragraph 19 of the
order for scheduled drugs, though the same is not required to be published on package or container.
Distinguishing feature of tax on sale of goods:
170. Applying the principles enunciated above, the conclusion to which one can safely reach is that
when the wholesaler sells any formulation to a retailer in bulk quantity, taxable event of sale of
goods takes place where wholesaler and retailers are the parties to contract, the goods in question
are the formulations and the consideration is one which is agreed to between the parties to that
transaction within the limits permissible by law. By substituting the assumed quantity of goods or a
price which is not subject-matter of that contract of completed sale for the purpose of measuring tax
the Legislature assumes existence of contract of sale of drugs by legal fiction which has not taken
place and which cannot be considered to be a sale in the manner stated in the Sale of Goods Act,
1930 which alone can be subject of tax under entry 54 of State List. Substitution of assumed price or
the assumed quantity in place of actuals in a completed sale transaction, for the purpose of levy of
tax on the subject-matter of tax results in taking away from it the character of "sale of goods" as
envisaged under the Sale of Goods Act 1930. Holding otherwise will result in permitting the State
Legislature to levy tax in presenti on the sale which has not come into existence and to allow the
future transaction which under entry 54 of List II of the Seventh Schedule is not permissible.
171. Another distinguishing feature to be kept in mind is that centre point of legislation under entry
54 of List II of the Seventh Schedule is "sale" in contrast with central point of legislation under entry
84 of List I of the Seventh Schedule is "Goods manufactured or produced". While basic nexus of levy
in the former is sale of specified goods, in the latter it is goods manufactured or produced in India.
172. The levy of tax on sale of goods is not a tax on goods simpliciter. One taxing event cannot be
subjected to tax with reference to another taxing event which has not even taken place and may not
ultimately take place at all in relation to the goods in question and which under the statute
authorising levy is not subject to tax.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 34Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
173. Every transaction of sale is independent and can be subjected to levy of tax and the components
and the measure which can make the tax levy effective must have nexus with the taxable event. The
point of collection and levy of tax may be shifted but the essential feature of the levy of tax on one
taxable event cannot be altered to another taxable event which the law does not permit. Where the
statute envisages multi level taxes, each event of sale becomes independently taxable event. In case
it is single point tax, it is for the Legislature to choose the point at which happening of taxing event
would become subject of tax and it is that contract of sale in series of sales that attracts
authorisation of levy. In respect of such identified taxing event whether the tax is collected in
advance or is postponed to a later stage, the liability remains in relation to that taxing event and not
to any other event. Else it would result in changing the nature of basic character of subject of tax.
174. This principle has been amply discernible from the ratio laid in Commissioner of Central Excise
v. ACER India Ltd. No. 2 .
175. It was a case arising under the Central Excise Act which imposes duty on manufactured goods
terms as excisable goods, and became subject of levy The assessee-manufacturer of computers,
peripherals, service note books and accessories, falling under different heads of excisable goods
under the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985. On orders received from its customers, it also load
operational softwares. Price of which is also charged from the customers. While calculating the
amount of Central excise payable thereon, the assessee claimed deduction of the value of operational
softwares from the total value of computer supplied to the customers. The Revenue objected to such
deduction on the premise that excise duty is payable on the entire value including the value of
softwares, as part of the computer manufactured by the assessee. It was held that loading of
software in the factory would come within the mischief of transaction value. The CEGAT allowed the
deduction claimed by the assessee relying on a division bench decision of the Supreme Court in PSI
Data Systems Ltd. v. Collector of Central Excise [1997] 2 SCC 78.
176. On appeal a division bench of the apex Court doubting the correctness of ratio laid in PSI Data
Systems' case , referred to a larger Bench.
177. The court dismissed the appeal of Revenue by holding that where goods non-excisable are
transplanted into excisable, will not make them excisable so as to make the assessee liable to duty on
combined value. The court said:
It must be borne in mind that Central excise duty cannot be equated with sales tax.
They have different connotations and apply in different situations. Central excise
duty is chargeable on the excisable goods and not on the goods which are not
excisable. Thus, a 'goods' which is not excisable if transplanted into a goods which is
excisable would not together make the same excisable goods so as to make the
assessee liable to pay excise duty on the combined value of both. Excise duty, in other
words, would be leviable only on the goods which answer the definition of 'excisable
goods' and satisfy the requirement of Section 3. A machinery provision contained in
Section 4 and that too in the Explanation contained therein by way of definition of
'transaction value' can neither override the charging provision nor by reason thereof
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 35Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
a 'goods' which is not excisable would become an excisable one only because one is
fitted into the other, unless the context otherwise requires.
178. This illustrates the point that non-taxable subject cannot be transplanted into taxable subject to
make the increased value chargeable to tax by taking it a measure. The ingredient which is not
subject of charge has to be excluded from the measure of levy for computation of tax.
179. Parity of reason makes us conclude that by devising a methodology in the matter of levy of tax
on sale of goods law prohibits taxing of a transaction which is not a completed sale and also confine
sale of goods to mean sale as defined under the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. This cannot be overridden
by devising a measure of tax which relates to an event which has not come into existence when tax is
ex hypothesi determined, much less which can be said a completed sale and which cannot be subject
of legislation providing tax on "sale of goods" by transplanting a sum related to as likely price to be
charged for subsequent sale to be taxed by the device of measuring tax for the completed transaction
which has become subject of tax. Ratio in ACER India Ltd.'s case , fully applies to present case.
180. Necessity of nexus between with subject of levy and measure of tax was also approved by the
apex Court in Atic Industries Ltd. v. H.H. Dave, Assistant Collector of Central Excise . It was a case
in which question arose whether excise duty will be levied at value of goods measured in terms of
price chargeable by the wholesale dealers to whom the manufacturer has sold the goods
manufactured by him. The appellant before the Supreme Court who was a manufacturer contended
that he can be subjected to duty on price charged by him on sales to wholesalers. The Revenue took
the view that the value of dye stuffs the goods should be taken at which ICI and Atul sold the same to
distributors and no deduction be allowed to manufacturer in respect of trade discount. The court
allowing the appeal, repelled the contention of Revenue and held as under;
The only relevant price for assessment of value of the goods for the purpose of excise in such a case
would be the wholesale cash price which the manufacturer receives from sale to the first wholesale
dealer, that is, when the goods first enter the stream of trade. ... If excise were levied on the basis of
second or subsequent wholesale price, it would load the price with a post-manufacturing element,
namely, selling cost and selling profit of the wholesale dealer. That would be plainly contrary to the
true nature of excise as explained in the Voltas' case [1973] 2 SCR 1089 : AIR 1973 SC 225 : 1973 Tax
LR 1710.
181. It may be relevant to recall here that the Supreme Court in Hotel Balaji's case [1993] 88 STC 98
(SC); AIR 1993 SC 1048, also held that where a tax was levied as a purchase tax and was confined to
the purchase price paid by the buyer, and was not chargeable at the price at which the end-product
was sold later, it had retained its character as a tax on purchase.
182. Similarly, if the taxing event is the single point sale and first point sale in the series of
transactions of sale is the taxable event which is authorised by law to be subject to levy of sale or
purchase tax, whether the tax is collected at that point or later, the component of that taxing event
can alone furnish the nexus for applying the rate of tax whether it may be related to the quantities of
goods sold or it may be the price for which the goods have been sold and purchased. But if one wants
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 36Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
to travel beyond the subject-matter of taxing event, it would be a different taxing event which would
be subject to tax. Similarly Supreme Court in ACER India Ltd.'s case [2004] 137 STC 596 (SC) :
[2004] 3 RC 421 (SC) : [2004] 8 SCC 173, clearly held that by transplant of non-excisable goods in
excisable goods, the levy cannot be imposed including the value of non-excisable goods in excisable
goods.
183. We may summarise the principles deducible from above discussion:
A. (i) The principle which can be well-settled is ; firstly that the term "sale of goods"
in entry 54, List II has the same meaning as sale defined under the Sale of Goods Act,
1930 and that the State Legislature cannot enlarge the meaning of sale so as to tax a
transaction which is not sale within the meaning of Act of 1930.
(ii) In a transaction of sale of goods which is liable to tax there must be concurrence
of the four elements, viz:
(1) Parties competent to contract;
(2) Mutual assent (3) A thing, the absolute or general property in which is transferred
from the seller to the buyer ; and (4) A price in money paid or promised.
(iii) A transaction which does not conform to this traditional concept of sale cannot
be regarded as one in respect of which the State Legislature is competent to enact an
Act imposing liability for payment of tax.
B. Tax is to be levied as soon as such completed transactions, which have all the above ingredients,
come into existence. It cannot be levied on a future transaction.
C. The compulsion of law is not coercion as defined in Section 15 of the Act and "in the eye of the
law, the agreement is freely made".
D. The full amount of money which goes from the pocket of the purchaser to the pocket of dealer as
a condition or consideration for the passing of the property in goods is the sale price. Whether it is
charged in one lump sum or split under different heads does not make any difference.
E. When the Legislature constructs a machinery for the recovery of the taxes which is within its
competence to impose, the said machinery should have some rational or intelligent connection with
the tax. In the absence of rational nexus between the purchaser and the tax on goods carried, it may
be open to a citizen to contend that the tax is not one justified by entry 54.
F. Subject always to the legislative competence of the taxing authority, the said tax can be levied at
convenient stage so long as the character of the impost, is not lost.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 37Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
G. There are three stages for imposition of a tax : (i) There is a declaration of liability that is part of
statute which determines what pursuance in respect of which properties are liable. (ii) Next thing is
the assessment. Liability does not depend on assessment, that ex hypothesi has already been fixed.
But assessment particularises the exact sum which a person is liable to pay. (iii) Lastly, come the
method of recovery if the person taxed does not voluntarily pay.
H. The components which enters into tax are well known : (i) The first is the character of the
imposition known by its nature which transpires attracting the levy. (ii) The second is a clear
communication of the person on whom the levy is imposed and which is obliged to pay the tax. (iii)
The third is rate at which the tax is imposed and the (iv) fourth is the measure or value to which the
rate is applied for computing the tax liability.
I. Decided cases establish a clear distinction between the subject-matter of a tax and the standard by
which the amount of tax is measured. These two elements are described as the subject of a tax and
the measure of a tax.
J. Any standard which maintains a nexus with the essential character of the levy can be regarded as
a valid basis for assessing the measure of the levy.
K. In any provision in the nature of machinery provision must be read so as to carry out the basic
concept of the levy.
L. Where the sales tax or purchase tax is levied on a dealer, the levy is usually with reference to his
turnover, which normally means the aggregate of the amounts of sale prices or purchase prices, as
the case may be.
M. To measure tax on sale or purchase of goods, price as basis is not only usual but also safe to avoid
uneven, unequal burdens, although it is conceivable that a Legislature can regard prices which
fluctuate frequently as too impractical to tailor the purchase tax.
N. In rare cases, when it is iniquitous to link purchase tax with price, more sensible bases can be
found. It may be levied on the occupier of a factory by reference to the weight of the goods
purchased by him.
O. So long as the levy retains the basic character of a tax on sale, the Legislature can levy it in such
mode or in such manner as it thinks appropriate.
P. Under the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1994 the tax is to be charged on turnover of the assessment
year in aggregate. The turnover is defined under Section 2(44) and taxable turnover under Section
2(42) of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1994.
Q. The turnover and taxable turnover have been defined in Section 2(44) and 2(42) respectively
Sub-section (44) of Section 2 states that turnover means the aggregate amount received or
receivable by a dealer for sales as referred to in Clause (38) including the purchase price of the goods
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 38Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
which are subject to purchase tax under Section 11 of the Act.
R. (i) Every transaction of sale is independent and can be subjected to levy of tax and the
components and the measure which can make the tax levy effective must have nexus with the
taxable event.
(ii) The point of collection and levy of tax may be shifted but the essential feature of the levy of tax
on one taxable event cannot be altered to another taxable event which the law does not permit.
S. (i) There is no multi-point tax within the State and the tax is levied on the first point sale within
the State in a series of sales.
(ii) The effect of single point tax in a series of sale transaction is that sale subsequent to point of sale
chosen as subject of tax cannot be taxed.
T. (i) Where the maximum retail price is fixed as provided under paragraph 7, of DPCO para 19
provides for price that can be charged from a retailer by a wholesaler.
(ii) the price component of sale transaction from a manufacturer, distributor or wholesaler to
retailer cannot be more than as provided under paragraph 19 of the order for scheduled drugs,
though the same is not required to be published on package or container.
(iii) Such price has to keep at least 16 per cent profit margin for the retailer. This is devised by
prescribing the price chargeable by wholesaler to be MRP minus margin of retailers profit.
184. An important aspect of tax on sale of goods is that no tax is leviable until sale to be taxed is
completed. Therefore, price as a measure of tax to quantify the tax on such sale may include all
incidental and ancillary expenses or charges until sale is complete by passing of title in goods to the
buyer. But it cannot include anything which does not become part of consideration received or
receivable by the seller for such sale. If any amount can be named by Legislature on which rate of tax
on sale of goods is to be applied, irrespective of its connection with completed sale, it will lose its
character as tax on sale of goods inasmuch as fixing any sum as measure de hors the transaction of
sale to be taxed will reduce the basic concept of tax on completed sale of specified goods to
redundancy.
185. We have noticed above that it is only the completed transaction which can be subjected to tax
and not agreement to sell, much less transactions which are yet to take place in future. Mere
agreement to sell or in the case of hire-purchase agreement until option is exercised by the buyer to
purchase goods, sale to buyer by financier was not held to be transactions of sale at all on which levy
could be imposed. It was clearly held by the apex Court in K. L Johar and Co's case [1965] 16 STC
213 (SC) that imposition of tax under hire-purchase agreement before option is exercised by the
hirer and title passes to him is ultra vires and the amount to which rate of tax is to be applied on
exercise by such hirer, has to be less than the first purchase price by excluding the element of hire
paid/payable by hirer up to the date of exercising option. It is a different matter that subsequently,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 39Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
the Parliament by amending the Constitution, vide 46th Amendment gave an extended meaning to
the sale of goods to include transaction of hire-purchase which have been held to be not transactions
of sale amenable to levy of tax under entry 54. But the fact remains that no tax can be levied with
reference to a transaction of sale which is not completed or has not come into existence. The
principle is excepted only to the extent provision has been made in Clause (29A) of Article 366.
186. The impact of levying tax on the taxing event of a transaction of sale of drugs by a wholesaler to
a retailer, identifying the wholesaler as the person on whom the incident of tax falls but applying the
rate to an amount related to transaction which is expected to take place in future between different
parties, viz., between the retailer the present buyer as seller and the end customer as buyer to whom
goods are subsequently sold will be contrary to constitutional scheme of tax on sale or purchase of
goods. As per provisions of the Act, said transactions being of tax-paid goods is not further taxable.
Rather it is possible that in the hands of the retailer such goods may not at all be sold either because
the same are destroyed or the same may pass expiry date and returned to the manufacturer. In
respect of such goods it becomes a levy of tax measured on an amount related to a non-event.
187. Moreover, law does not envisage only single intermediary sale. In a given case, subsequent sale
to the taxable event may be an inter-State sale or a sale outside State, MRP may not at all become
chargeable in the State to ever become subject of tax.
188. Similarly, if the first point sale in the State is inter-State sale, the rate fixed under two
enactment will be to different measure in respect of two identical transaction by the same dealer.
189. Therefore, the principle that tax may be collected in advance before the event takes place or
subsequent stage cannot be applied to the case of tax on single point sale of goods in a series of sale
transactions. In such event, if it is justified collection of tax on sale when sale takes place between
wholesaler and the retailer, it amounts to tax a subject which has not come into existence. On the
other hand, if it is taken to be a mere measure of tax, and not the convenient collection of tax at
earlier point, the measure of tax is by engrafting an element of event which is not taxable. In such
event, as per principle enunciated in ACER India Ltd. [2004] 137 STC 596 (SC) : [2004] 3 RC 421
(SC) : [2004] 8 SCC 173, it is not permissible.
190. In this connection, the principle has clearly been stated in ACER India Ltd's case [2004] 137
STC 596 (SC) : [2004] 3 RC 421 (SC) : [2004] 8 SCC 173, that by including the value of
non-excisable article with excisable article the measure of tax cannot be increased. In the wide
discretion vested in Legislature to chose a suitable measure to which rate of tax may be applied, one
inherent restriction is that in doing so it cannot implant a non-taxable value with taxable value.
191. The contention that like the excise duty, the sales tax is ultimately passed on to the consumer
and it can be recovered from any person at a convenient stage on a sale of goods, and therefore, if a
transaction of sale by wholesaler to the dealer is taxed on a price chargeable from the consumer of
the goods, it retains its nexus with the transaction of sale of goods, overlooks the fact that tax on
sales is not a tax on goods, but is on compendium of grains which constitute a "sale of goods". If the
tax were only on goods perhaps the MRP chargeable by end-dealer could be considered as having
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 40Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
nexus with subject of tax in which case, it may retain its connection with the goods to be taxed. But
essence of subject of tax under entry 54 is "sale" and not the goods alone.
192. It was noticed by the Federal Court in Province of Madras v. Boddu Paidanna & Sons [1942] 1
STC 104 : AIR 1942 FC 33, that the tax on sale of goods on every successive transaction of sale from
the manufacturer to the end-purchaser is a taxable event which can attract the tax. It is for the State
legislation to make all the events as a taxable event on which taxes are charged or to make one such
taxing event in a series of sales on which tax is to be charged. Once the Legislature chooses that only
one transaction in a series of transactions is to be subjected to tax and also identifies the sale which
in the series of sale is to become subject of tax, it cannot subject such sale to tax by transplanting
component of subsequent transaction which has not come in existence and when it comes into
existence subsequently. This is so because it disjuncts such measure of tax from that sale of goods
which becomes subject of charge. The measure to which rate of tax is applied must have integral
connection with the transaction that is the subject of tax. It cannot be said that once sale has taken
place which attracts tax, it can be levied and measured on any standard divorced from the subject of
sale.
193. Permitting this means permitting legislation to insert one or other of the essential ingredients
of sale by creating legal fiction which in fact is not ingredient of sale which may become subject of
tax. This in turn will result in extending the meaning of "sale" beyond what is meant by sale within
the meaning of Act of 1930. As discussed above, it is not permissible for the State Legislature to
enlarge the definition of "sale" beyond what is meant under the Indian Sale of Goods Act for taxing
purposes under entry 54 of List II of the Seventh Schedule.
194. It may be viewed from another aspect. Section 4A envisages tax on a price chargeable on future
sale only in respect of sale of such goods where MRP is published on package or container. The
object is stated to be that in case of tax on first point sale or at earlier point, the end-buyer pays
much more then the buyer at such earlier stage. With this object, to choose only the MRP branded
goods have no nexus, to depart from normal levy in respect of sale of other commodities by
departing from normal rules of computing taxable turnover. The end-consumer in the case of single
point tax in a series of sales, invariably pays more price than the price paid at an earlier sale in series
of sales, when it becomes a taxing event. On the other hand, the MRP is published with the object of
protecting consumer interest and keep a check on gross profit to be earned in respect of such
commodities. A legislation which defeats this object also by subjecting consumer to pay more for
such commodities, than in respect of commodities, which do not carry MRP by levying tax with
respect to higher value, and ultimately for consumer the taxes paid by him become part of this
purchase price.
195. It is not related to subject sale which has come into existence and become taxable, and the sale
which may come later on by the retailer is not subject of tax.
196. If the legislation can provide for a measure of tax on subject of tax by substituting any notional
value, which at no point of time become part of or related to subject of tax, viz., "sale of goods", then
the fact that it is related to MRP loses its significance altogether. If this is granted that the legislation
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 41Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
can provide for any measure the purpose of applying the rate of tax different from the ingredient of
subject of tax, whether it is founded on MRP or any other fixed value which Legislature may provide
will make little difference. Such is not even the case of State that even if the measure is not relatable
to MRP, it can substitute any value as a measure of tax and rightly so because subject of tax is not
the goods or goods sold, but subject is a transaction of "sale of goods" as defined under the Sale of
Goods Act, 1930.
197. In this connection reference may be usefully made to principle emerging from Union of India v.
A. Sanyasi Rao [1996] 219 ITR 330 SC. Section 44AC was inserted in the Income-tax Act, 1961 by
the Direct Tax Laws Amendment Act, 1989 with effect from April 1, 1989. Section 206C was inserted
in the said Act by the Finance Act, 1988 with effect from April 1, 1988. Explanation to Section 44AC
was inserted by Finance Act, 1990 with effect from April 1, 1991. These provisions enabled the
Revenue to estimate the profits on a presumptive basis in the case of persons dealing in country
liquor, timber, forest produce, etc. Perhaps the Government wanted to get over the problem of
assessing income and recovering tax in cases of person dealing in such commodity. It was also
observed that business of such persons existed only for short period, and after period of contract in
many cases it was not even possible to trace them and many were found to be dealing benami.
Section 44AC occurred in Chapter IV of the Act dealing with computation of income. Section
44AC(1) determines profits and gains of the year from trading of certain specified goods like liquor
at a particular percentage of package price specified therein. The object of said provision was
explained in a memorandum as "with a view to combat large scale tax evasion by person deriving
income from such businesses where the bill seeks to insert new Section 44AC to provide for
determination of income in such cases". About Section 206C it was stated that "it is proposed to
introduce a new Section 206C to provide that any person, being a seller referred to in Section 44AC
shall collect income-tax of a sum equal to 20 per cent of the amount paid or payable by the buyer as
increased by a surcharge for the purposes of the union. . . ."
198. The validity of two provisions were challenged before various High Courts. All the High Courts
upheld the competence of Parliament to enact Section 44AC and Section 206C. Interpretation of
section came up before A.P. High Court. The A.P. High Court upholding the validity of the Act read
down the Section 44AC of the Act and held it only to be an adjunct to Section 206C and to explain
provision of Section 206C and not to dispense with the regular assessment in accordance with the
provisions of the Income-tax Act. It was held that the subject-matter of tax, viz., "income" cannot be
determined notionally by making such specific provision when in all other cases only the real
income to be computed in accordance with provision of Section 28 to Section 43C. The apex Court
noted that one of the contentions raised in the petition was that "tax is levied on hypothetical
income and not on real income/'
199. In the end conclusion, the court concurred with the conclusion reached by the A.P. High Court
in its judgment reported in Sanyasi Rao A. v. Government of Andhra Pradesh [1989] 178 ITR 31, and
held that Section 44AC is a valid piece of legislation and is adjunct to and explanatory to Section
206C. It does not dispense with regular assessment as provided in accordance with Section 28 to
Section 43C of the Act. The court approved the following conclusion of the A.P. High Court:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 42Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
The non obstante clause in Section 44AC(1), 'notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in Sections 28 to 43' would be confined to the limited purpose of
sustaining the deductions provided for in Section 206C, The level of profits and gains
would be relevant only for explaining and justifying the level of deductions provided
for in Section 206C. Collections will be made at the rates specified in Section 206C
and then a regular assessment will be made like in the case of any other assessee. . . .
On this aspect, we may as well refer to the words 'in the assessment made under this
Act' in Sub-section (4) of Section 206C. These words show that an assessment under
the Act is still to be made even where tax is collected under Section 206C. This, in our
opinion, is a strong indication supporting our construction of Section 44AC. . . . We
uphold the validity of Section 206C. We also hold that Section 44AC is a valid piece of
legislation, read in the manner indicated by us. Section 44AC is not to be read as an
independent provision but as an adjunct to and as explanatory to Section 206C. It
does not dispense with a regular assessment altogether. After the tax is collected in
the manner provided by Section 206C, a regular assessment will be made where the
profits and gains of business in specified goods will be ascertained in accordance with
Sections 28 to 43C.
200. The court did not countenance substitution of a fictional income as a subject of tax for the
purpose of determining tax but confined the operation of it as machinery provision for the purpose
of deducting tax under Section 206C which was held to be measure of advance tax, subject to regular
assessment. However, it clearly did not countenance substitution of subject of tax by leaving normal
provision for determining real income which is subject of tax. Deviation from normal provision for
determining subject of tax only in certain commodities was held to be not within the constitutional
limits but violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.
201. Before us, the specific case of the respondents is also that Section 4A(1) is an adjunct to
charging provision contained in Section 4 of the Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1994. Hence, the measure
envisaged under Section 4A cannot be divorced from point of taxable sale and from the import of
turnover and taxable turnover. Hence, the measure has to be read in substitute of MRP as price
deemed to be recovered or recoverable to Section 4A applicable to first point sale.
202. Section 4A(1) refers to levy and collect tax on sale of goods at retail price thereof as abated by
the rate specified in the notification. Read by itself, it applies to all goods whether such retail price is
fixed under any statute or is required to be published on package under law. Sub-section (2)
confines its applicability to goods where retail price is required to be published on package or
container under any law.
203. The objects and reasons for inserting provision like Section 4A in the Sales Tax Act makes it
further clear that the provision has been made to bring the levy of "tax on sale of goods" within the
State of Rajasthan at par with the levy of "excise duty" under the Central Excise Act, 1944. In the
Statement of Objects and Reasons for insertion of Section 4A, it has been stated that:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 43Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
in the first point tax system, generally the tax is collected at the first sale by registered
dealer, and no tax is leviable on subsequent sales even though the value addition is
significant. It has been the experience that with the introduction of the concept of
levying Central excise duty based on maximum retail price, there is increased
buoyancy in the duty receipts. We in our State intend to rationalise the present tax
system by switching over to the maximum retail price concept for levy of sales tax in
respect of notified commodities so as to collect tax on the maximum retail sale price
less abatement specified by the State Government.
204. Apparently, to achieve the aforesaid objective of collecting tax on maximum retail price under
the Scheme of the tax on first point sale of goods ignore the basic difference between the subject and
nature of tax between the two taxes. In drawing parity between the two taxes ; the basic difference
between the two taxes as discussed above and clearly discernible from the decided cases, has been
ignored. The duty of excise is on "the goods" which come into existence as a result of manufacture,
or production, and therefore, the manufacture or produce of the goods remains the subject of tax
irrespective at the point at which tax is collected and value of goods always have a nexus with the
subject. Value of goods is a conceptual value determination falling within the domain of legislative
scheme. Price of goods at any stage is only one of the mode by which value can be determined. But
the subject of "tax on sale or purchase of goods" is the "sale". Price as essential element of sale has
definite legal connotation and is not to be determined de hors the sale itself on any conceptual
standards. It is part of it as consideration paid or agreed to be paid. Therefore, on the first point sale,
it is the whole constituent factors of sale that remains the subject of tax Levying tax on such sale
with a factor which is connected with last point sale divorces the levy from the basic subject of sale
on which tax can be levied.
205. However, as has been analysed above that each successive sale becomes a new taxing event,
providing an independent subject which can be taxed and one sale cannot be engrafted in another
for the purpose of levy. It is open for the legislation to choose to have recourse to multi-point levy or
single point levy. In case it decides to levy a single point tax, the point at which the sale is to be taxed
is also for the legislation to decide and it is the sale which occurs at the point so devised that
becomes subject of tax and not the subsequent sale. If the tax is levied at the last point within the
State, the price that is paid or becomes payable within the State in respect of that sale may provide a
valid basis if no other basis is provided having nexus with the sale for levy of the tax on sales.
206. Therefore, the view adopted by State of Section 4A about providing measure of tax for sale of
drugs or pharmaceutical production by manufacturer, wholesaler or distributor to retailer runs
counter to the single point levy.
207. If the tax on sale of goods under entry 54 is tax on sale as defined in the Sale of Goods Act,
1930, the price as defined on the goods remains an integral part of sale which becomes subject of tax
and the levy cannot be divorced therefrom where price and not the weight of goods is to measure of
tax.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/883389/ 44Rajasthan Chemists Association vs State Of Rajasthan And Ors. on 29 March, 2005
208. If Section 4A is designed to bring a levy into existence which is divorced from the sale subject
to tax under the Act, it falls foul with the legislative competence under entry 54 of List II of the
Seventh Schedule so also notification, annexure 3, to the extent it is intended to levy tax on first
point sale with reference to price which could be charged in respect of a subsequent sale which has
not come into existence at the time liability to tax arises and is determined ex hypothesi.
209. However, the perusal of the language of Section 4A and the notification issued thereunder by
itself does not show that it applies only in cases of sales to be taxed at first point. In case the levy is
on the last point and the maximum retail price is to be fixed and published under any statute,
whether instead of determining price actually charged in each case fixed formula is provided by the
enactment which has correlation with determining price by keeping in view the provisions of Section
9 of the Sale of Goods Act whether the provision still falls beyond the scope of entry 54 has not been
the subject-matter of contention in this case and therefore, we have not been called upon to decide.
In absence of any contention having been raised, it will be hasardous to comment upon the validity
of provisions of Section 4A in isolation and the notification issued thereunder in its entirety.
210. In view thereof, we confine our conclusion and hold that to the extent that tax on first point sale
of drugs, medicines or any formulation or for that matter any other commodities by a
manufacturer/wholesaler/distributor to retailer where MRP is published on package, measure to
which rate of tax is to be applied cannot be with reference to such published MRP, which is neither
charged nor chargeable by the wholesaler from the retailer whether the tax is charged on sales or on
purchase by the parties to sale under Section 4A and notification, annexure 3.
211. The additional tax collected with reference to measure provided under Section 4A by the
wholesalers to retailers at first point sale shall not be refunded to the dealers. In case the additional
tax charged has not been transmitted to buyers, the excess tax paid may be adjusted against future
liability under the Act of 1994 or any other dues to the Revenue under Rajasthan Sales Tax Act.
212. The petition is accordingly, disposed of.
213. No order as to costs.
