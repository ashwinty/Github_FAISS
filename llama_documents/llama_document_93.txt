This appeal by special leave is preferred against the judgment of the Punjab and Haryana High
Court in R.S.A. No. 1807/71 dated February 3, 1982. The appellants are the legl representatives of
the deceased plaintiff. For the sake of convenience, the parties are referred hereinafter as 'plaintiff'
and 'defendants'. The second defendant, a proforma party, is the father of the first defendant.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/360147/ 1Brij Raj Singh (Dead) By L. Rs. & Ors vs Sewak Ram & Anr on 22 April, 1999
The plaintiff filed Suit No. 722/67 for recovery of possession of the suit site from the defendants.
According to the averments in the plaint, the suit site was acquired by the plaintiff under a gift deed
dated 18.1.1961 registered on 9.2.1961 and marked as Exbt. PW- 6/1 in the suit. One Kanwar
Chander Raj Saran Singh was the donor under the said gift deed. The plaintiff before filing the
present suit for possession preferred an application for ejectment of the defendants before the Rent
Controller alleging that the first defendant who was a tenant under him denied the title. The learned
Rent Controller by his order dated 16.1.1967 held that the first defendant was a tenant under the
plaintiff and further held that the first defendant was liable to be ejected from the suit site. However
on appeal the appellate authority by its order dated 3.6.1967 reversed the finding of the learned Rent
Controller and held that the plaintiff has not proved that there existed a landlord and tenant
relationship. Accordingly, while allowing the appeal, the appellate authority dismissed the
application for ejectment preferred by the plaintiff.
In the light of the order of the appellate authority, the plaintiff filed the present suit for possession
on the basis of the said gift deed. The plaintiff appears to have examined 13 witnesses on his side
and placed a number of documents to support his claim for possession.
The defendants resisted the suit contending that they are the owners, that Kanwar Chander Raj
Saran Singh had no connection whatsoever with the suit property and, therefore, had no right to
make the gift deed in favour of the plaintiff. The gift deed, if any, he alleged, must be a devise by the
plaintiff to grab the defendants' property. The defendants also denied that the plaintiff was the
landlord of the suit site.
Defendants appear to have examined three witnesses.
However, the defendants have not filed any documents to substantiate their claim.
The trial court on the bais of the pleadings framed the following issues:-
i) Whether the plaintiff is the owner of the property in suit as alleged.
ii) Whether the suit is within time.
iii) Relief.
The trial court on the basis of the oral and documentary evidence found that the plaintiff derived
title to the suit property under the gift deed dated 18.1.1961 and that the suit was in time.
Accordingly a deeree for possession was granted on 15.1.1971 by the trial court.
The defendants aggrieved by the decree for possession granted by the trial court preferred an appeal
to the Senior Sub-judge, Gurgaon. Before the first appellate court for the first time the Defendants
raised an objection that the gift deed has not been duly proved in accordance with the provisions of
Transfer of Property Act and hence cannot be taken into account to confer title on the plaintiff. The
lower appellate court, for the reasons stated in its judgment, held that the gift deed was not duly
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/360147/ 2Brij Raj Singh (Dead) By L. Rs. & Ors vs Sewak Ram & Anr on 22 April, 1999
proved and hence the plaintiff cannot be held to be the owner of the suit site. On that ground the
lower appellate court allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit preferred by the plaintiff. The lower
appellate court, however, held that the suit was in time and the original owner of the suit site was
Kanwar Chander Raj Saran Singh.
The High Court in the second appeal preferred by the plaintiff, after noticing that no specific
objection regarding execution or attestation of the gift deed was taken by the defendants, confirmed
the judgment of the lower appellate court, Hence, the present appeal by special leave.
Mr. Shanti Bhushan, learned Senior Counsel for the Plaintiff now represented by L.Rs. submitted
that the lower appellate court and the High Court went wrong in allowing the defendants to raise an
objection regarding execution or attestation of the gift deed as no such objection was specifically
raised in the written statement nor in the cross-examination of the plaintiff's witnesses nor even in
the arguments before the trial court. According to the learned Senior Counsel, the gift deed was duly
attested by two witnesses on the first page of the document which was not noticed by the lower
appellate court and the High Court. The attestation was duly proved by PW-6 who has subscribed
his signatures in the gift deed at three places in three different capacities, namely, as scribe, as
attesting witness and as identifying witness before the Registrar. He has spoken about his role as
stated above in his evidence which was not challenged by the defendants in the cross-examination.
In may event, according to the learned Senior Counsel, the examination of one attesting witness
satisfies the requirement of section 68 of the Evidence Act. He also submitted that even one
attesting witness need not have been examined in view of proviso to Section 68 of Evidence Act as
admittedly no specific challenge was raised either in the written statement or before the trial court
even subseuent to the filing of the written statement. It is the further contention of the learned
Senior Counsel that having regard to the recitals in the gift deed to the effect that the deed preceded
by an oral gift coupled with the possession (long before the application of the provisions of the
Transfer of Property Act to Punjab and Haryana), the compliance of section 123 of the Transfer of
Property Act was not required. The learned Senior Counsel for the plaintiff cited a number of
authorities to support these submission.
Mr. M.L. Verma, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the defendants, contending contra,
submitted that the presentation of the document, namely, gift deed by power of attorney was
defective inasmuch as that power was not produced. At this stage we must state that after perusing
the original gift deed (PW-6/1) in the court and in particular the endorsement of the Sub-Registrar
on the second page regarding the productionof registered deed of power of attorney, the learned
Senior Counsel did not pursue this contention. He also submitted that an identifying witness cannot
be treated as an attesting witness. In support of that, he cited an authority of this Court. Again this
point does not arise for cnsideration in view of the fact that it is not the case of the plaintiff before us
that the identifying witnesses are to be treated as attesting witnesses. We may point out at this stage
that such an argument no doubt was placed before the lower appellate court and the High Court on
behalf of the plaintiff. Before us such argument was not advanced and, therefore, that question does
not arise. Mr. Verma, learned Senior Counsel for the defendants, submitted that the point regarding
execution or attestation though raised for the first time before the appellate court is permissible as it
was only a question of law. Regarding what amounts to a valid attestation in a registered document,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/360147/ 3Brij Raj Singh (Dead) By L. Rs. & Ors vs Sewak Ram & Anr on 22 April, 1999
Mr. Verma, learned Senior Counsel, cited a number of authorities and submitted that the lower
appellate court and the High Court had correctly decided the issue by holding that the gift deed was
not proved and consequently the plaintiff did not derive any title to the suit site. He also contended
that notwithstanding the finding of the courts below that the owner of the suit site was Kanwar
Chander Raj Saran Singh, the defendants cannot be dispossessed except by the true owner. Lastly,
he contended that mere marking of exhibit (gift deed) does not amount to proof.
In the light of the contentions raised before us the issue that arises for consideration is whether the
lower appellate court and the High Court were right in law in allowing the defendants to challenge
the gift deed based on want of strict compliance of Section 3 and 123 of the Transfer of Property Act
even though no such plea was raised in Written Statement, no issue was therefore framed and no
argument was advanced in the trial court. Apart from the above question of law, we have to see
whether the lower appellate court ad the High Court correctly appreciated the facts and properly
looked into the gift deed in issue.
After carefully going through the judgments of all the three courts below and after perusing the
original gift deed (Exbt. PW6/1), we find that the lower appellate court and the High Court had not
looked into the document carefully before giving their findings. The lower appellate court in the
course of the judgment in more than one place has stated that the gift deed was executed by the
power of attorney which is a wrong statement. The lower court has stated as follows:-
"The gift deed is said to have been executed by one Shri Janardhan Parshad as an
attorney of Kn. Chander Raj Saran Singh. It was pointed by Shri T.C. Jain that unless
the plaintiff produced the power of attorney of Janardhan Parshad Sharma, it could
not be held executed by a person duly authorised to execute the same.
Again the lower appellate court observed as follows :-
"The objection urged by Shri T.C. Jain regarding the admissibility of the gift deed
must, therefore, prevail on the ground that the gift deed has not been duly got proved
in accordance with the provisions of Section 123 of the T.P.Act and secondly it has
also not been proved that the donor duly authorised Janardhan Dass to execute the
same as a general attorney in favour of the plaintiff.
While negativing a contention put forward on behalf of the Plaintiff, the lower
appellate court observed as follows:-
"...it was necessary on the part of the plaintiff to have proved by positive evidence
that Janardhan Dass Sharma was duly authorised to execute the gift deed in favour of
the plaintiffy by Kn. Chander Raj Saran Singh."
It is nobody's case that the gift deed was executed by the power of attorney. A persual of the gift
deed clearly shows that Kanwar Chander Raj Saran Singh admittedly owner of the property has
executed the gift deed and the power of attorney, namely, Janardhan Prashad Sharma was only
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/360147/ 4Brij Raj Singh (Dead) By L. Rs. & Ors vs Sewak Ram & Anr on 22 April, 1999
authorized to present the document for registration. The lower appellate court without looking into
the document proceeded as if the execution of the document was by a power of attorney and in the
absence of a power to execute the document, the gift was not proved. Further, the lower appellate
court in the course of the judgment has held as follows:-
"An attesting witness must be a person who signed the document purporting to do so
as an attesting witness. I have examined the said document and find that this
document has been only attested by one witness namely Sobha Ram. The name of
Ram Saran Dass appears in the said document as that of a scribe and he is only an
identifying witness who has identified the execution made before the Sub-Registrar.
Thus, it is evident that the gift deed which was the basis of the suit and which alone
could confer the title of ownership on the plaintiff has not been proved in accordance
with the provisions of Section 123 of the Transfer of property Act and in view of the
same the Trial Court was not justified in placing relience on this document."
Sobha Ram was not the attesting witness for the gift deed. He was only an identifying witness before
the Registrar as seen at page 2 of the original gift deed. The lower appellate court has totally
ingnored the categorical evidence of pw 6 stating that he has also signed as witness. Section 3 of of
the Transfer of Property Act specifically states that no particular form need be followed in the matter
of attestation. It can be at first, as in this case, or at last page.
The High Court, however, has rightly noticed that the gift deed was executed by Kanwar Chander
Raj Saran Singh. However, the High Court held that the gift deed has not been duly attested as
required under Section 123 of the Transfer of Property Act. The High Court in the course of
judgment observed as follows:-
From the persual of the gift deed, it is quite evident that this was executed by Kanwar
Chander Raj Saran Singh on 18.1.1961. No one has signed as a witness to the
document. The scribe Ram Saran Dass has written "dated 18th January, 1961
Bakalam Ram Saran Dass". Later on, on 9th of February, 1961, the said document
was presented for registration by one Janardhan Sharma who claimed himself to be
the Mokhtiar-a-Aam of donor Kanwar Chander Raj Saran Singh. The necessary
power of attorney in his favour dated 18th of February, 1953 was also produced
before the Sub-Registrar by Ram Saran Dass - the scribe and one Shabha Ram.
According to the learned counsel for the appellant, since Janardhan Sharma, the
Mukhtiar-a-Aam of the donor Kanwar Chander Raj Saran Singh admitted the
execution of the document before the Sub-Registrar and Ram Saran Dass, the scribe
and Shabha Ram attested the same before Sub-Registrar, it will amount tto
attestation as required under section 123 of the Transfer of Property Act. In support
of this contention, he relied upon Girja Datt Singh Vs. Gangotri Datt Singh (AIR 1955
S.C. 346) and Narain Singh Vs. Parsa Singh alias Parsu (1971 C.L.J. 195).
L.....I..........................................................J After hearing the learned counsel for the
parties at a great length, as observed earlier, it appears that before the trial Court no
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/360147/ 5Brij Raj Singh (Dead) By L. Rs. & Ors vs Sewak Ram & Anr on 22 April, 1999
such objection was taken specifically either at the time of admission of the document
Exhibit PW6/1 or at the time of the arguments. It was only at the appellate stage that
this objection was taken on behalf of the defendant that the gift deed on the basis of
which the plaintiff claimed himself to be owner of the site in dispute, is not a valid
document as it was never attested by any of the witnesses as required under the
Transfer of Property Act. This objection prevailed with the lower appellate court. The
argument of the learned counsel for the appellant that the admission made by
Janardhan Sharma, Mukhtiar-a-Aam of the donor and signed by the scribe Ram
Saran Dass and Shabha Ram before the sub-Registrar, will amount to attestation, has
no merit. The document was required to be attested at the time when it was actually
executed on 18.1.1961 by Kanwar Chander Raj Saran Singh. Since no one attested the
document at that time, the subsequent signatures of the scribe and Shabha Ram who
identified the Mukhtiar-a-Aam Janardhan Sharma before the Sub-Registrar, could
not fill up the lacuna. Under Sub-Section (2) of Section 35 of the Registration Act, the
registering officer may, in order to satisfy himself that the persons appearing before
him are the persons they represent themselves to be or for any other purpose
contemplated by this Act, examine any one present in his office. Thus Ram Saran
Dass and Shabha Ram only identified the Mukhtiar-a-Aam Janardhan Sharma in
order to satisfy the registering officer. In Timmavva Dundappa Budibal vs. Channava
Appaya Kanasgeri (AIR (35) 1948 Bombay 322) it has been held that signatures made
by the Sub-Registrar while he made endorsement on the document admitting it to
registration and the signatures of the identifying witnesses made by them when they
identified the executant before the Sub-Registrar cannot be regarded as the
signatures of attesting witnesses. Moreover, at the time of registration the donor
himself did not appear. It was only his Mukhtiar-a-Aam Janardhan Sharma who
presented the same for registration on his behalf. The authorities relied upon by the
learned counsel for the appellant, are not at all applicable to the factsof the present
case and are clearly distinguishable. Since, there was no attestation witness at the
time of the execution of the document of 18th of January, 1961, the lower appellate
court rightly came to the conclusion that the gift deed, if is taken away as nt duly
executed, the plaintiff cannot be held to be the owner of the suit land because he
claimed his title on the basis of the gift deed alone.
At this stage, let us extract the relevant section in Transfer of Property Act and
Evidence Act.
Transfer of Property Act:-
S.3 In this Act, unless there is something repugnant in the subject or context, -
"Attested" in relation to an instrument, means and shall be deemed always to have
meant attested by two or more witnesses each of whom has seen the executant sign or
affix his mark to the instrument, or has seen some otther person sign the instrument
in the presence and by the direction of the executant, or has received from the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/360147/ 6Brij Raj Singh (Dead) By L. Rs. & Ors vs Sewak Ram & Anr on 22 April, 1999
executant a personal acknowledgement of his signature or mark, or of the signature
of such other person, and each of whom has signed the instrument in the presence of
the executant; but it shall not be necessary that more than one of such witnesses shall
have been present at the same time, and no particular form of attestation shall be
necessary. [only relevant portion is set out] "S.123 For the purpose of making a gift of
immoveable property, the transfer must be effected by a registered instrument by or
on behalf of the donor, and attested by at least two witnesses.
For the pourpose of making a gift of moveable property, the transfer may be effected
either by a registered instrument signed as aforesaid or by delivery.
Such deliverry may be made in the same way as goods sold may be delivered."
The Indian Evidence Act "S. 68. Proof of executing of document required by law to be
attested - If a document is required by law to be attested, it shall not be used as
evidence untile one attesting witness at least has been challed for the purpose of
proving its execution, if there be an attesting witness alive, and subject to the process
of the Court and capable of giving evidence :
Provided that it shall not be necessary to call an atesting witness in proof of the
execution of any document, not being a will, which has been registered in accordance
with the provisions of the Indian Registration Act, 1908 (16 of 1908), unless its
execution by the person by whom it purports to have been executed is specifically
denied.
It is common ground that the defendants have not raised any objection, leave alone
specific objection as to the validity of execution/attestation of/in gift deed. Naturally,
there was no issue on this aspect. Even the witness (PW 6) was not cross-examined
from this angle. Hence we are unable to sustain the contention of Mr. Verma that this
being a pure question of law can be raised at the appellate stage. This is a mixed
question of fact and law. Proviso to section 68 of the Evidence Act dispenses with the
necessity of calling an attesting witness in proof of any document, except a will, which
has been registered in accordance with the provision of the Indian Registration Act
when there is no specific denial by the party against whom the document is relied
upon.
In this context, we may usefully refer to the decision cited at the bar.
In Venkata Reddi vs. Muthu Pambulu (AIR 1920 Madras 588), a Division Bench of
the High Court had occasion to consider the scope of Section 68 of the Evidence Act.
After setting out Section 68 the Court observed as follows :-
"I think the implication from the language of the section is that, if one attesting
witness has been called (if there be an attesting witness alive, etc.) then the document
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/360147/ 7Brij Raj Singh (Dead) By L. Rs. & Ors vs Sewak Ram & Anr on 22 April, 1999
can be accepted by the court (of court, if it believes his evidence) as evidenciny a
mortgage transaction as the necessary evidence insisted upon by S. 68, Evidence Act,
of document required by law to be attested has been given. In other words, the
document can, on that evidence, be treated by the court as having created the charge
on immovable property which it purports to create. S. 68 requires that only one
attesting witness (if alive) should be called for the purpose of proving execution
subject, of course, to the condition that witness is subject to the process of the Court
and capable of giving evidence. The lower appellate Court however, held that either
two attesting witnesses should be called when two are alive and that, even assuming
that one only need be called, he should, at least, be made tto prove that another (or
the other) attesting witness besides himself also saw the execution. Hence it held that
the plaint document was not properly proved as a mortgage document as one only of
the attesting witnesses was called and he merely proved its execution by defendant 1
and the attestation by himself (that witness) and he was not asked about any other
attestor having seen the execution".
While upsetting the above view of the lower appellate court, the learned Judges held
as follows:
"The fact that the Evidence Act is ten years older that the Transfer of Property Act has
no relevancy in the consideration of this question. I might add that S. 69, Evidence
Act, says that, if no such attesting witness can be found, proof that the attestation of
one attesting witness at least is in the hand-writing of that witness and that the
signature of the person executing the document is in the handwriting of that person
is proof which might be accepted as sufficient by the Court. If S. 59, Transfer of
Property Act, is interpreted as we are invited to interpret it as adding another
requisite (even in the circumstances contemplated by section 69, Evidence Act, that is
even where no attesting witness is alive or could be found), namely direct proof that
two attesting witnesses saw the execution, it would be practically impossible in most
such cases to adduce evidence of third persons about attestation by two witnesses
and many old mortgage transactions could never be proved at all as such.
Documents, say about 28 years old, where it is not at all unlikely that the two
attestors and the mortgagee have died (life not being too long in this country), cannot
be proved at all to be valid documents unless some third persons who did not attest
but merely happened to be present at the execution and attestation (a very unlikely
contingency) happened to be alive, remembered what happened long ago of a
transaction at which they were casually present and could therefore be called to prove
the attestation by two attestors. If the argument is pushed to its logical limit, then
even S. 90, Evidence Act, which says that a document purporting to be 30 years old,
can be presumed to have been validly executed and attested, must be deemed to have
been overruled by the privisions of section 59 of the later Transfer of Property Act.
No doubt where the provisions of Section 68, Evidence Act, have been complied with
by calling the attesting witness to prove the execution by the mortgagor, and the
attestation by himself (the witness) and the document may therefore be accepted by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/360147/ 8Brij Raj Singh (Dead) By L. Rs. & Ors vs Sewak Ram & Anr on 22 April, 1999
the court as prima facie sufficiently proved to be a valid mortgage, that prima facie
proof can be rebutted by proof on the other side, that the other witness or witnesses
who has or have also apparently attestated document did not really see its execution
and that the document therefore did not comply with the requirements of section 59,
Act 4 of 1882."
In lachman Singh Vs. Surendra Bahadur (AIR 1932 Allahabad
527) a Full Bench of the High Court considered the issue and answered as follows:-
"Now let us consider the merits of the arguments. for the appellants, it is argued that
by compliance with the privision of Ss. 68, 69 and 71, Evidence Act, a party succeeds
only in making the mortgage-deed, or any other deed, like a ded of gift reuired to be
attested by at least two witnesses, admissible in evidence but in order to be able to
show that the document is a valid deed of mortgage or a valid deed of gift, he must
also prove further that it was attested by two witnesses. It is conceded on behalf of
the respondents and indeed the matter cannot be disputed that where the validity of
the deed propounded either as a deed of mortgage or as a deed of gift is specifically in
question, on the ground whether or not, the requirements of Ss 59 and 123, Transfer
of Property Act, had been complied with, the party relying on the deed must prove
that it had been attested by at least two attesting witnesses. But the question is where
the mere execution of a document has to be proved either because of the case being
ex-parte or because of a mere denial of the execution, whether it would still be
necessary to prove that the document was attested by two attesting witnesses."
"Where a mortgagee sues to enforce his mortgage and the execution and attestation
of the deed are not admitted, the mortgagee need prove only this much that the
morttgagor signed the document in the presence of an attesting witness and one man
attested the document provided the document on the face of it bears the attestation of
more than one person; but if the validity of the mortgage be specifically denied, in the
sense that the document did not affect a mortgage in law then it must be proved by
the mortgagee that the mortgage deed was attested by at least two witnesses."
Again in Jhillar Rai vs. Rajnarain Rai (AIR 1935 Allahabad
781) the High Court held as follows :
"There has been a subsidiary argument that the plaintiffs cannot claim to be
co-shares, because the mortgage deed has not been proved. The argument is based on
the provision of S.68, Evidence Act. It appears that the execution of the mortgage was
proved, but not by the production of marginal witness. Under S.68 as it now runs, it
is not necessary to prove or to produce a marginal witness unless the mortgage is
specifically denied. It is obvious that there would be no necessity to prove the deed at
all if it was admitted and consequently the section contemplates a distinction
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/360147/ 9Brij Raj Singh (Dead) By L. Rs. & Ors vs Sewak Ram & Anr on 22 April, 1999
between the position where execution is not admitted and a position where execution
is specifically denied. In the present case the plaintiffs in the first paragraph of the
plaint stated that they were mortgagees under the deed dated 23rd September, 1929,
and that they had ben in possession of the plots in question. The defendants said in
their written statement that they did not admit this paragraph. But it is clear from the
additional pleas that what they were questioning really was not the execution of the
deed but the fact of possession. No issue was framed clearly on the question of
execution. In these circumstances it cannot be held that the execution of the
mortgage was specifically denied. The mortgage was therefore sufficiently proved."
We do not want to add the citation except to refer a judgment of the Guwahati High Court in Dhiren
Bailung vs. Bhutuki & Ors. (AIR 1972 Guwahati 44), wherein the court held as follows:-
"All that Section 68 demands before a document requiring attestation can be used as
evidence is that one attesting witness at least should be called "for the purpose of
proving its execution". It has been stated above that one attesting witness was called
in the present case and he testified that Sashi and Paniram had executed the
mortgage deed Ex. 1 in his presence by placing their signatures on it and that he had
attested the document. Therefore, the requirements of Section 68 were evidently
satisfied. However, the two courts below were of the opinion that it was incumbent
upon the plaintiff to establish before he could succeed in that suit, the attestation of
the deed by two witnesses, as enjoined by section 59 of Transfer of Property Act, in
the manner required by section 3 thereof where the expression "attested" is defined. I
find it difficult to endorse that opinion. AIR 1932 All. 527 (FB) Lachman Singh vs.
Surendra Bahadur, is an authority for the propositions that Sections 68 & 69 of the
Evidence Act "make a document which is attested admissible in evidence if the
requirements of those sections are complied with" and that "if the documents become
admissible in evidence they become admissible to prove what they contain. That is to
say, they would become admissible to prove whether a mortgage had been executed
or a gift had been made".
There seems to be no warrant for an argument, the Full Bench observed that a deed may be marely
admissible and yet may be incapable of being read as a document of the kind which it professes to
be. The Full Bench clinched the issue by stating further that to make a mortgage deed or a gift deed
admissible in evidence as a deed of mortgage or gift, as the case may be, it is enough to comply with
the provisions of section 68 or S. 69 of the Evidence Act. However, it was added that if the question
raised is whether the document did create a mortgage or gift or not, it must be proved that the
requirements of law as contained in Sections 59 and 123, Transfer of Property Act, have been
complied with. I respectfully agree with these observations of the Full Bench. Therefore, the precise
question that falls for determination in the present appeal is whether, on the pleadings of the
parties, there arises a question whether the deed Ext. 1 does or does not create a mortgage."
"To sum up, I hold that the defendants had denied only the execution of the mortgage
deed, that they had not challenged its due attestation, that the legality of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/360147/ 10Brij Raj Singh (Dead) By L. Rs. & Ors vs Sewak Ram & Anr on 22 April, 1999
mortgage deed was assailed on the specific ground that Sashi and Paniram had no
exclusive right to mortgage the land in dispute, and that the parties went to trial only
on the specific allegations adopted by them in their written pleadings. I hold further
that in the context of the parties, pleadings the plaintiff was called upon to prove only
the execution of the mortgage deed, that the execution is proved by the testimony of
Harakanta Duara, an attesting witness, and plaintiff's father Tularam, and that the
testimony of Harakanta Duara constitutes enough of compliance with the statutory
requirements set out in the body of section 68. Hence the mortgage pleaded by the
plaintiff is proved beyond doubt."
We are of the view that the above extracts from the judgments of the various High Courts do reflect
the correct position in law. In the case on hand PW 6 has categorically stated that he has signed as
scribe, signed as witness and signed as identifying witness. We also find his signatures at three
places. Nothing was elicited from this witness to disbelieve his statement in Chief Examination. It is
not denied that the deed was registered as per the Indian Registration Act. Therefore even on merits
the appellant has established the due execution and attestation of the gift deed at the first page by
the side of signatures of the donor, two witnesses have subscribed their signatures. We, therefore,
hold that the lower appellate court and the High Court went wrong in allowing the defendants to
raise the plea of non-compliance of Section 123 of the Transfer of Property Act and in holding that
the gift deed was not proved.
So far as the case law cited by Mr. Verma, learned Senior Counsel for the defendants, is concerned,
we find that it may not be necessary to refer the same so far as they related to the points that
identifying witness cannot be an attesting witness; that mere marking of exhibit does not amount to
prove and that no one except the ture owner can discharge possession as there is no dispute on these
points.
As regards the cases cited on the issue of attestation, we find that Roda Framroze Mody vs. Kanta
Varjiyandas Saraiya (AIR 1946 Bombay 12), and Vishnu Ramkrishna and Ors. vs. Nathu Vithal and
Ors. (AIR 1949 Bombay 266) relate to will and as such may not be apposite to the case o hand
concerning gift deed. In Sarkar Barnard & Co. vs. Alok Manjary Kuari & Anr. (AIR 1925 Privy
Council 89), Abinash Chandra Bidyanidhi Bhattacharjee vs. Dasarath Malo & Ors. (AIR 1929
Calcutta 123), and sundrabai Sonba Tendulkar vs. Ramabai Jayaram (AIR 1947 Bombay 396) the
question of failure to raise specific denial regarding execution/attestation and the consequences
thereof did not arise and, therefore, those cases are not quite relevant. In N. ramaswamy Padayachi
vs. C. Ramaswami Padayachi & Ors. (AIR 1975 Madras 88) factually specific denial was raised and
in that context the judgment was delivered on the scope of Section 123 of Transfer of Property Act.
In Balappa Tippanna, vs. Asanqappa Mallappa and Another (AIR 1960 Mysore 234), the Court held
as follows :-
"The net effect of S. 68 is that if the execution of a document of gift is specifically
denied, then an attesting witness must be called to prove it. If, however, such
execution is not specifically denied, then it would not be necessary to call an attesting
witness to prove the same. But the document all the same will have to be proved. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/360147/ 11Brij Raj Singh (Dead) By L. Rs. & Ors vs Sewak Ram & Anr on 22 April, 1999
effect of the proviso is that the due execution and attestation of the gift deed will have
to be proved, although it may be proved by calling a person other than an attesting
witness."
Here again there is no quarrel on the proposition set out above.
Now coming to the facts, the High Court is not right in proceeding that gift deed was not attested by
any of the witnesses as required under the Transfer of Property Act. As noticed earlier the lower
appellate court rested its conclusion about the gift deed on the worng assumption that the deed itself
was executed by a power of attorney and in the absence of such power of attorney, and as only the
witness attesting the deed, the execution of gift cannot be upheld. Apart from that, we have perused
the original document and we find that two witnesses, namely, Ram Chander Sharma and Ram
Saran Dass Sharma, have signed on the first page of the document along side the signature of
Kanwar Chander Raj Saran Singh. We do not know how this had escaped the attention of the courts
below. At this stage it is necessary to point out that Ram Saran Das Sharma who was examined as
PW-6 has stated as follows. The entire deposition is given below :-
"I know Kanwar Chander Raj Saran singh son of Rao Brijraj Singh. I was employed
with them for fifteen years. I have seen him, reading, writing and signing. I can
identify his signatures. I am the scribe of the gift deed (Hibbanama) Ex. PW6/1. I had
scribed the same correctly on the instructions of Chander Raj Singh. I had read it
over to him and after accepting the same as correct, he had signed in my presence. I
have also signed as a witness. I know Shri Janardhan Sharma. He was manager and a
general power of attorney. He had the right to execute the sale. I also identify the
signatures of Janardhan."
(Emphasis supplied) Cross-examination "I cannot tell the date of the deed of the general power of
attorney (mukhtiarnama). I am not in possession of a copy now. It is incorrect to suggest that I was
not present at the time of registration. My signatures are also there as a scribe. Gift deed
(hibbanama) was presented by Janardhan. There has been a partition between Chander Raj Singh
and his son, but I cannot tell the year precisely, may be it took place in the year 1960-61. It does not
bear my signature."
It is seen from the above that Ram Charan Dass sharma has categorically stated that he has signed
the document as a witness apart from the fact that he has also scribed and signed as identifying
witness. We found three signatures of Ram Saran Sharma at different place in different capacities in
the original gift deed.
On the important point regarding attestation there was no cross-examination presumably this was
not raised and hence ws not an issue. This being the position, we are unable to comprehend how the
lower appellate court and the High Court gave the findings against the plaintiff as noted above.
The gift deed was executed by the original owner and presented for registration by a duly authorised
power of attorney and the document was duly attested by 2 witnesses, out of whom one was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/360147/ 12Brij Raj Singh (Dead) By L. Rs. & Ors vs Sewak Ram & Anr on 22 April, 1999
examined to prove the deed and nothing more is required to satisfy the requirements of Section 123
of Transfer of Property Act, particularly when no specific denial was taken to the execution or
attestation of the gift deed in the written statement or even subsequently before the trial court.
In the result, we set aside the judgment of the lower appellate court as affimed by the High Court
and resotre the decree of the trial court. The appeal is allowed with costs, which we quantify at Rs.
5,000/-.
