CAV JUDGMENT
(PER : HONOURABLE MS.JUSTICE HARSHA DEVANI)
1. These matters were earlier heard by this Bench and vide order dated 4.4.2017, the court had
posted the matter for dictation of judgment on 17.4.2017. On 16.2.2018, this court passed the
following order:-
"1. This matter had been heard at length in March/April,2017 and after arguments
were concluded, the matter was posted for dictation of judgment on 17.4.2017. On
that day it was not possible to dictate the judgment in view of the regular board as
well as the fact that simultaneously, while this matter was being heard, the court was
also hearing voluminous criminal appeals in one of the biggest riot cases arising out
of the massacres that took place in the aftermath of the burning of a coach of the
Sabarmati Express, during the second session on a day to day basis, in view thereof, it
was not possible to deliver the judgment in this case. The summer vacation
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 2Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
commenced on 6th May, 2017 and with effect from 5th June, 2017 there was a change
in the roster whereupon the criminal appeals were heard for the whole day.
Considering the volume of the evidence involved in the matter, the hearing continued
till mid August and since the facts were fresh in the mind of the court, the first
priority was to complete the judgment in that case. In October, 2017 there was a
change in the roster and the bench was assigned taxation matters and unfortunately,
one of the members of the bench was incapacitated due to ill health for a considerable
period from October, 2017 to January, 2018 and hence, it was not possible to
complete the dictation of the judgment in the matter. On 14th February, 2018, one
Mr. Amar N. Barot, General Secretary of the Textile Labour Association made a
mention before the court that the judgment in the case may either be dictated or the
matter may be released and sent to the regular bench.
2. It may be noted that the record of this appeal is also quite voluminous and as referred to earlier,
the hearing went on for several days. The court has minutely recorded the submissions of the
learned counsel for the parties and the learned counsel for the parties have also submitted written
submissions and hence, despite the delay, there was no difficulty on the part of the court in dictating
the judgment. The matters were posted for dictation of judgment today, that is, on 16th February,
2018.
3. When the matters were called out for dictation, Mr. D.S. Vasavada, learned advocate for the
Textile Labour Association, expressed reservations about the court dictating the judgment and
vehemently submitted that the matter be released and be sent before the regular bench. The reason
put forth for making such request is that in the intervening period, that is, from the time when the
matter was heard, till the matter came to be listed for dictation, several workers have passed away
and further that several matters have been remanded by the Supreme Court and in view of the
pendency of this matter, the learned advocate for the appellants has been requesting the concerned
Benches not to take up the matter on the ground that similar issues are involved in this case. Though
there was strong objection to such request by Mr. M.I. Hava, learned advocate for the appellant, the
learned advocate for the Textile Labour Association was insistent that the matter be released. What
was more perturbing was that the learned counsel for the Official Liquidator also quite vocally
supported such request. It may be noted that except for the two grounds stated hereinabove, the
learned counsel have not voiced any other objection to the court proceeding further and delivering
the judgment in this case.
4. On the other hand, Mr. M. I. Hava, learned advocate for the appellant, strongly objected to the
request made by the learned counsel for the respondents and submitted that when the court has
heard the matter at length and is ready to proceed with the dictation of the judgment, such request
should not be accepted. It has further been submitted that no written application has been filed on
affidavit giving details about the number of workers who have passed away nor has any request been
made by the learned counsel for the respondents in the interregnum and that the request made by
the learned counsel for the respondents is not a bona fide one, inasmuch as, even if another Bench
takes up the matter for hearing, it is not likely to be decided at an early date.

5. Having considered the request of the learned advocates for the respondents, viz. the Textile
Workers Union and the Official Liquidator, the court is of the view that it cannot be disputed that
there has been some delay in dictating the judgment after the matter was heard in the month of
April, 2017. Considering the first ground put forth by the learned counsel for the respondents, it is
difficult to understand as to how not proceeding with the judgment would in any way serve the
interest of the workers inasmuch as the regular Bench would have to rehear the matter and decide
the same which would again consume some time. Insofar as the second ground, namely because of
the pendency of this matter, the other cases which have been remanded by the Supreme Court are
not being decided, is concerned, it may be pertinent to note that the Supreme Court while
remanding the matters has observed thus:
"24. Though we have affirmed the order dated 17- 10- 2008 of the Gujarat High Court
passed in Jabal C. Lashkari v. Official Liquidator and dismissed the civil appeals
arising out of SLPs (C) Nos. 29282-84 of 2008 (Jabal C. Lashkari v. Official
Liquidator), our decision to affirm the said judgment of the High Court is based on a
consideration of the specific clauses in the lease deed between the parties to the case.
What would be the effect of the principles of law underlying the present order
vis-a-vis the specific clauses of the lease deed between the parties in the other cases is
a question that has to be considered by the High Court in each of the cases. That
apart, whether the order dated 17-7- 2006 passed in State of Gujarat v. Official
Liquidator has attained finality in law and forecloses the question raised and further
whether constructions have been raised on such land by the State Government for the
benefit of the general public, as has been submitted to dissuade us from interfering
with the order of the High Court, are questions that would require a full and complete
consideration by the High Court on the materials available. To enable the said
exercise to be duly performed, we set aside the orders of the High Court impugned in
each of the aforesaid civil appeals and remit all the matters to the High Court for a
fresh consideration in accordance with the observations and principles of law
contained in the present order."
Thus, each case that has been remanded has to be decided by the High Court by considering the
specific clauses of the lease deed between the parties in the respective cases, which certainly would
not be identically worded. Moreover, the facts involved in this case are peculiar to it, inasmuch as
after the initial lease deed came to be executed, there has been two subsequent transfers by the
concerned lessees, one by a registered deed and another (in favour of the company in liquidation) by
an unregistered deed. Therefore, the pendency of this judgment would have no effect on the other
matters which are pending before the court as each matter has to be decided on the basis of the
recitals contained in the individual lease deeds. The learned counsel for the appellants therefore,
does not appear to be justified in seeking adjournments in other cases on the ground of pendency of
this case. Thus, no valid ground has been made out for releasing the matter at the stage of judgment.
However, considering the manner and the vehemence with which the request for releasing the
matter is concerned, it appears that there is more to it than meets the eye, and indirectly, the
learned counsel as well as his client Mr. Amar N. Barot, General Secretary appear to have expressed
lack of faith in this Bench. Under these circumstances, the court would be reluctant to proceed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 4Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
further and impose a judgment on parties who have reservations about justice being done in the
matter and therefore, deems it fit to release the matter.
6. In view of the above, despite having heard the matter at length, instead of proceeding with the
dictation of the judgment, with regret the court is constrained to release the matter. Let the appeal
be listed before the regular Bench.
7. At this stage, Mr. M.I. Hava, learned counsel for the appellant, requested the court to stay the
operation of this order for a period of two weeks to enable the appellant to approach the higher
forum. Considering the nature of the order that has been passed, the request is declined."
2. The applicant herein challenged the said order before the Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No.9939
of 2018, wherein the following order came to be passed on 25.9.2018 :-
"1. Leave granted.
2. We have heard the learned counsels for the parties.
3. Having considered the matter we are of the view that the Hon'ble Judges who have
passed the impugned order and recused themselves from hearing should hear and
decide the matter at the earliest. We order accordingly.
4. We are told at the Bar that the Hon'ble Judges have already heard the matter and
the same has been reserved for pronouncement.
5. If the Hon'ble Judges feel the necessity of further hearing, such further hearing will
also be undertaken. We further record that in the facts of the case we do not consider
it necessary or prudent to record our reasons for the view taken.
6. Consequently, and in the light of the above, the order of the High Court is set aside
and the appeal is allowed in the above terms."
3. Since a considerable time had elapsed since the matter was earlier heard, the Bench was required
to hear the matter once again, accordingly the learned counsel for the respective parties were heard
at length once again.
4. This case has a chequered history. The applicants herein filed a Judges' Summons being Company
Application No.16 of 1999 in Company Petition No.139 of 1988, wherein the applicant sought the
following reliefs:-
"(A) to direct the Official Liquidator of the Ahmedabad Jubilee Spinning and
Manufacturing Mills Company Limited (in liquidation) to handover peaceful and
vacant possession of the lands bearing survey No.53 admeasuring 4 acres 16 gunthas
and survey No.55 admeasuring 0 acres 15 gunthas of village Dariapur -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 5Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
Kazipur of Town Planning Scheme No.14 bearing final plot No.41 District and Sub district
Ahmedabad to the applicant;
(B) to direct the Official Liquidator to pay the arrears of rent/ mesne profits, arrears of land revenue,
municipal taxes, etc. that may be found to be due in accordance with the lease deed dated
11/03/1911 read with the sale deed dated 11/03/1964;
(C) to restrain by an order and injunction application the Official Liquidator, his agents/ assignees
from transferring selling, alienating or dealing with in any manner whatsoever the lands bearing
survey No.53 admeasuring 4 acres 16 gunthas and survey No.55 admeasuring 0 acres 15 gunthas of
Town Planning Scheme No.41 bearing final plot No.41 District and Sub district Ahmedabad;
(D) to provide for the cost of this Application;
(E) to grant such other and further reliefs as this Hon'ble Court may deem fit and proper in the facts
and circumstances of the case."
5. In support of the Judges' Summon, the applicant filed an affidavit dated 26.1.1999, wherein it was
inter alia submitted that the applicant is the owner of the lands bearing Survey No.53 admeasuring 4
acres and 16 gunthas and Survey No.55 admeasuring 0 acres and 15 gunthas of village Dariapur
Kazipur of Town Planning Scheme No.14 bearing Final Plot No.41 District and Sub district
Ahmedabad (hereinafter referred to as the "subject property"). It is further averred that the subject
property was for the first time leased to Ahmedabad Jubilee Spinning and Manufacturing Mills
Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as "the Ahmedabad Manufacturing Company") by
Surajben Patel, widow of Motilal Maganlal and Smt. Rukhmaniben Patel, daughter of Shri Motilal
Maganlal Patel (hereinafter referred to as "the lessors") pursuant to a registered lease deed dated
4.8.1911. It is further averred that Rukhmaniben Patel, one of the two lessors, by her last Will and
testament dated 22.4.1937 provided therein with respect to the property in paragraph 2 thereof that
Shri Vaikunthlal Narandas (the son of the younger brother of her husband) on her death would
become the owner of the property. The said Will was registered on 2.4.1937. Rukhmaniben Patel
passed away on 28.12.1956 and Surajben predeceased Rukhmaniben. As per will dated 17.4.1937,
the property came in the hands of Vaikunthlal Narandas Patel who transferred the property by way
of a registered sale deed dated 21.1.1958 in favour of Smt. Kamlaben Patel, daughter of Jamnadas
Haribhai together with all the rights of the lessors under the registered lease deed dated 4.8.1911
and its rights thereunder and also the Will dated 17.4.1937. Smt. Kamlaben Patel by a further
registered deed dated 11.3.1964, transferred the subject property by sale thereof in favour of the
lessors under the registered lease deed dated 4.8.1911 and her rights under the registered deed dated
21.1.1958. As the applicant Smt. Sadgunaben Vaikunthlal Patel became old and weak in health, a
power of attorney dated 29.6.1998 came to be executed in favour of Shri Anilkumar Vaikunthlal
Patel, who is the son of Smt. Sadgunaben Vaikunthlal Patel. Thereafter the power of attorney, Smt.
Anilkumar Vaikunthlal Patel, upon inquiry, learnt that the company had committed various
breaches and violated the terms and conditions of the lease deed dated 4.8.1911 and had failed to
pay the rent/mesne profit/ land revenue, etc. since 1989-90 to the applicant Smt. Sadgunaben
Vaikunthlal Patel, who, therefore, became entitled to recover the possession of the property. It is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 6Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
further averred that the applicant (power of attorney Shri Anilkumar Vaikunthlal Patel) further
learnt that the company had closed down its manufacturing activities and was unable to run its
business and ultimately, by an order dated 5.9.1989 passed in Company Petition No.139 of 1988,
this court ordered the company to be wound up and the first respondent was appointed as liquidator
of the company and has taken over the possession of the company including the subject property. It
is further averred that to the knowledge of the applicant the first respondent has sold the movables
of the company and that the company cannot now carry on its activities in any manner whatsoever.
5.1 It is further averred that in respect of the subject property, the first respondent - Official
Liquidator of the Ahmedabad Jubilee Spinning & Manufacturing Mills Company Limited ( in
Liquidation), was in the process of commencing sale thereof by inviting offers, etc. It is the case of
the applicant that the first respondent does not require in any manner the subject property for the
purpose of winding up the company and that if the first respondent is permitted to sell, alienate,
transfer or otherwise deal with the property and/ or is permitted to create third party interest
therein, the applicant's right to the property would be severely jeopardised and the applicant would
suffer grave and irreparable loss which cannot be compensated in terms of money.
5.2 It is further averred that the first respondent, after taking over the possession of the subject
property pursuant to the orders of this court has failed and neglected to pay the amount of nominal
rent of Rs.500/- per annum as contemplated under the lease deed dated 4.8.1911. Moreover, to the
knowledge of the applicant, the company or the first respondent has not made payment towards
local taxes, cesses, etc. required to be paid under the original lease deed dated 4.8.1911 read with the
subsequent registered transfer deeds. Along with the application, the applicant has also annexed the
documents referred to hereinabove.
6. Company Application No.16 of 1999 came to be decided by a common judgment and order dated
30.7.2002 passed by the learned Company Judge, whereby it was held as follows:-
"40. To summarise:
[a] Leasehold interest is an intangible asset, which is valuable in nature though the
valuation may differ from case to case depending upon the unexpired period of lease.
[b] Such an asset is transferable subject to the same terms and conditions as may be
stipulated in the lease deed.
[c] Once there is a contract which has not been determined, the relationship of the
parties to the contract continues to subsist till the period for which the contract is in
existence subject to an express condition to the contrary.
[d] There is a distinction between the point of time when an order of winding up is
made and at the point of time when an order of dissolution is made, the company
continues to exist between the two terminii.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 7Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
[e] A condition in the lease deed permitting a lessee to give back the possession as
and when the lessee chooses to do so cannot be converted into an obligation entitling
the lessor to seek possession.
[f] A condition in the lease deed by way of requirement to pay rent, per se, does not
create an onerous covenant, once readiness and willingness is shown by the lessee, or
on its behalf, to discharge such obligation.
41. In light of what is stated hereinbefore, it is not possible to accept the case of the
applicants. The possession of the land in question cannot be directed to be handed
over to the applicant landlords for the various reasons stated hereinbefore. The
applications are therefore rejected. There shall be no order as to costs."
7. Being aggrieved, the applicant preferred appeal being O.J. Appeal No.1 of 2003 under section 483
of the Companies Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as "the Companies Act") before a Division Bench
of this court. By a judgment and order dated 23.10.2008, the Division Bench, following its earlier
judgment dated 17.10.2008 passed in O.J. Appeals No.65 to 67 of 2006 dismissed the appeal,
subject to the clarification that the secured creditors will provide necessary finance for payment of
rent by the Official Liquidator to the lessors of the property in question, in case, the Official
Liquidator is not having the adequate funds for payment of such rent to the lessors.
8. The applicant challenged the above order of the Division Bench before the Supreme Court, which
by a common judgment and order dated 29.3.2016 passed in the case of Jabal C. Lashkari and
others v. Official Liquidator and others, inter alia held thus:-
"20. The mere fact that the company has been ordered to be wound up cannot be a
ground to direct the official liquidator to handover possession of the land to the
owners inasmuch as the company in liquidation continues to maintain its corporate
existence until it stand dissolved upon completion of the liquidation proceedings in
the manner contemplated by the Companies Act. In the present case it has been
repeatedly submitted before this Court by both sides that presently revival of Prasad
Mills is a live issue pending before the Gujarat High Court, a fact which cannot be
ignored by this Court in deciding the above issue against the appellant.
21. For the aforesaid reasons we affirm the order of the High Court dated 17.10.2008
in O.J. Appeal Nos. 65 of 2006, 66 of 2006 and 67 of 2006 and dismiss the civil
appeals arising out of SLP(C) Nos.29282-29284 of 2008 wherein the said order is
under challenge.
22. The other civil appeals, which have been heard analogously, can be divided into
two categories. The first is where the order dated 17.10.2008 passed in O.J. Appeal
No.65 of 2006 [Jabal C. Lashkari & Ors. v. Official Liquidator & Ors.] impugned in
civil appeals arising out of SLP(C) Nos.29282-29284 of 2008 has been followed. In
the other group are the cases where the said order has been followed and also an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 8Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
additional ground has been cited namely that in view of the order dated 17.07.2006
passed in Company Application No.250 of 2006 a direction has been issued to
handover possession of the leased premises to the State Government; hence the
question of putting the property to sale does not arise.
23. Though we have affirmed the order dated 17.10.2008 of the Gujarat High Court
passed in O.J. Appeal Nos.65 of 2006, 66 of 2006 and 67 of 2006 and dismissed the
civil appeal arising out of SLP(C) Nos.29282-29284 of 2008 [Jabal C. Lashkari &
Ors. v. Official Liquidator & Ors.] our decision to affirm the said judgment of the
High Court is based on a consideration of the specific clauses in the lease deed
between the parties to the case. What would be the effect of the principles of law
underlying the present order vis-à-vis the specific clauses of the lease deed between
the parties in the other cases is a question that has to be considered by the High
Court in each of the cases. That apart whether the order dated 17.07.2006 passed in
Company Application No.250 of 2006 has attained finality in law and forecloses the
question raised and further whether constructions have been raised on such land by
the State Government for the benefit of the general public, as has been submitted to
dissuade us from interfering with the order of the High Court, are questions that
would require a full and complete consideration by the High Court on the materials
available. To enable the said exercise to be duly performed, we set aside the order of
the High Court impugned in each of the aforesaid civil appeals and remit all the
matters to the High Court for a fresh consideration in accordance with the
observations and principles of law contained in the present order."
9. Thus, what is set aside by the Supreme Court is the order of the High Court impugned in each of
the civil appeals and matters are remitted to the High Court for a fresh consideration in accordance
with the observations and principles of law contained in the said order. The appeals against the
order passed by the learned Company Judge, therefore, do not survive. Ideally, therefore, this
matter should have been heard and decided by the learned Company Judge in view of the fact that
the Supreme Court had set aside the decision of the High Court and remanded the matter for fresh
consideration in accordance with law. What was subject matter of appeal before the Supreme Court
were the orders passed by the Division Bench of the High Court affirming the order passed by the
learned Company Judge. Therefore, in effect and substance, the order passed by the learned
Company Judge also stands set aside. Consequently, the applications have to be heard afresh.
However, a coordinate Bench had passed the following order on 1.8.2016:-
"1. Shri Vasavada, learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the workmen urged in the
morning at the time of mentioning that in this group of matters, the original
proceedings date back to 1989 and 1999 and the workmen have not received
complete fruits of the litigation. He, therefore, urged for priority in the matters as the
Supreme Court has remanded the matter only on limited aspect.
2. Shri Desai also joins the request for atleast fixing the matters on some date on
which the matters may go ahead so that all the concerned Counsel those who are
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 9Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
appearing in the matter or would be appearing in the matter may have adequate
notice of the date on which the matters are to be taken up.
3. Learned Counsel Shri Hawa, who appears in OJ Appeal No.60 of 2003 and OJ
Appeal No.1 of 2003 urged that in fact, these matters should have been relegated to
the learned Company Judge as the Supreme Court has ordered that the matters be
decided afresh. In support of his submission, he relies upon order of this Court in
LPA No.1142 of 2004 dated 15.01.2007.
4. We are of considered view that Shri Hawa's submission cannot be accepted by this
Court in view of unequivocal order of the Supreme Court in which the matters are
remanded and the challenge in the Supreme Court was arising from the order passed
by the appellate Bench in OJ Appeals. In that view of the matter, the order of remand
need to be understood as if it is remanded to the Court in the proceedings of OJ
Appeals only. Hence, we are unable to accept the submission advanced on behalf
learned Counsel Shri Hawa.
5. In view of the plight narrated on behalf of the workmen, we are also unable to
adjourn the matters for longer period as prayed for by Shri Hawa on behalf of his
clients. We are, however, of the view that let these matters be fixed on a date, of
which other Advocates appearing may have knowledge. Hence, we are keeping these
matters on 09.08.2016 at 02.30 pm. Copy of this order be placed in each of the
matters so that by all concerned, appropriate note of the fact be taken that the
matters are going to be peremptorily heard on 09.08.2016 at 02.30 pm.
6. For time being, all the matters be placed and in the matters which are not urgent,
we may pass appropriate orders for separating the same.
7. Office is directed to list the matters in a separate Board at 02.30 pm."
9. Subsequently, the applicant herein as heir and legal representative of the original applicant Smt.
Sadgunaben Vaikunthlal Patel filed a Judges Summons being O.J. Civil Application No.358 of 2016
in Company Application No.16 of 1999 seeking the following reliefs:-
"(A) To delete the Official Liquidator of the Ahmedabad Jubilee Spinning and
Manufacturing Company Limited and in place thereof to substitute the name of the
Official Liquidator of the Ahmedabad Jubilee Mills Limited (in liquidation).
(B) To implead the Official Liquidator of Ahmedabad Manufacturing and Calico
Printing Company Limited (in liquidation) as party in the proceedings herein.
(C) To direct the O.L. Of Ahmedabad Jubilee Mills Ltd. to handover peaceful and

Dariapur-Kazipur of Town Planning Scheme No.14 bearing Final Plot No.41, Dist.
and Sub-Dist. Ahmedabad to the Applicant.
(D) To direct the O.L. Of Ahmedabad Jubilee Mills Ltd. to pay the arrears of
rent/mesne profits, arrears of land revenue, municipal taxes amounting to Rs.14.11
Crore etc. that may be found to be due;
(E) To provide for the cost of this Application.
(F) To pass such other order or orders as in the interest of justice this Hon'ble courts
may deem fit and proper."
10. In support of the Judges' summons, the applicant filed an affidavit wherein he has stated that his
grandmother Smt. Sadgunaben Vaikunthlal Patel had filed Company Application No.16 of 1999 and
has further referred to the prayers made in the said application. It is further stated that by registered
lease deed dated 4.8.1911 executed by his predecessor-in-title in favour of Ahmedabad Jubilee
Spinning and Manufacturing Company Limited, land bearing Survey No.53 admeasuring 4 acres 35
gunthas and Survey No.55 admeasuring 0.15 gunthas of T.P. Scheme No.14 (Shahibaug), Final Plot
No.41, Moje- Dariapur-Kazipur, City Ahmedabad was leased on the terms and conditions contained
therein. By virtue of interim orders, the Company Judge had directed the Official Liquidator to file a
report in response to the Application No.16/99 and 58/99 vis-à- vis the stand taken by the secured
creditors of both the companies. Pursuant to the said direction, no affidavit was filed by any of the
secured creditors of both the companies.
However, from the statement of affairs filed by ex-Directors of Ahmedabad Jubilee Mills Limited on
17.11.1990, it was noticed that there were only three secured creditors, namely, Bank of India, State
Bank of India and Punjab National Bank and the subject property of the applicant was not charged,
mortgaged or in any manner secured by the said Ahmedabad Jubilee Mills Ltd.
10.1 It is further averred that from the report submitted by the Official Liquidator in Company
Application No.16 of 1999, it was noticed that there was some discrepancy in the name of the
company and, therefore, upon a proper search being taken, it was found that by a registered sale
deed of movable assets and assignment of leasehold rights dated 29.3.1941, executed by Ahmedabad
Jubilee Spinning and Manufacturing Company Limited, all assets, plants, machinery, all movable
and immovable properties including leasehold rights in the subject property were assigned, sold and
transferred for the consideration stated therein in favour of Ahmedabad Manufacturing and Calico
Printing Company Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Calico Limited.").
10.2 It is stated that in view thereof, Calico Limited became the assignee of the leasehold rights of
the subject property. Calico Limited went in liquidation, and by an order of this court dated
15.7.1998 passed in Company Application No. 157 of 1995, the Official Liquidator of this court was
appointed as liquidator of Calico Limited. Therefore, it had become necessary to join the Official
Liquidator of Ahmedabad Manufacturing and Calico Printing Company Limited as party respondent
in these proceedings so that the orders that may be passed in these proceedings can be effectively
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 11Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
executed and implemented.
10.3 As regards prayer for substituting the Official Liquidator of Ahmedabad Jubilee Mills Limited
in place of Ahmedabad Jubilee Spinning and Manufacturing Company Limited, it was submitted
that Ahmedabad Manufacturing after selling its assets to Calico Limited had become a defunct
company and dissolved. The Official Liquidator had pointed out that no company known as
Ahmedabad Jubilee Spinning and Manufacturing Company Limited is in existence. It is further
averred that there was some litigation by secured creditors of Calico Limited in respect of ownership
of movable and immovable properties of the companies as is evident from the judgment of this court
in the matter of Civil Application No.302 of 1999 filed by ICICI Limited against the Official
Liquidator of Ahmedabad Manufacturing and Calico Printing Company Limited reported in 2001 JX
GUJ 92. It was further noticed that on 28.12.1982, a company known as Gaurav Chemtax Industries
Limited (hereinafter also referred to as "Gaurav Chemtex") was incorporated and it was a wholly
owned subsidiary of Calico Limited. It is further averred that it appears that Calico Limited by an
unregistered agreement dated 24.6.1983 entered into with Gaurav Chemtex Industries Limited,
transferred the undertaking, business and operation of its Division known as "Jubilee Mill Unit" to
Gaurav Chemtex Industries and subsequently, it was renamed as Ahmedabad Jubilee Mills Limited.
It is pointed out that ICICI Bank preferred an appeal against the said judgment which came to be
withdrawn. It is further averred that the Ahmedabad Jubilee Mills Limited being in possession of
the subject property became tenant of the applicant under the provisions of the Gujarat Rent Act.
The yearly rent of Rs.500/- was paid till 1995 by Calico Limited for and on behalf of the tenant. The
tenant, that is, Ahmedabad Jubilee Mills Limited closed its operation in 1987 by the order dated
5.9.1989 of this court passed in Company Petition No.139 of 1988, whereby it was ordered to be
wound up and the Official Liquidator of this court was appointed as a liquidator of the said
company.
10.4 That on 30.7.2002 Judges' Summons filed by the petitioner for arrears of rent and taking
possession of the leased premises was rejected by this court by a common judgment in the group
matter of Fakirchand Ambalal v. O.L. Of Amruta Mills Ltd., 2002 (3) GLH 367, and that being
aggrieved by the common judgment, the applicant filed O.J. Appeal No. 1 of 2003 on 21.8.2002.
10.5 It is further averred that the Official Liquidator of Ahmedabad Jubilee Mills Limited, pursuant
to the order dated 8.6.2004 of this court in Company Application No.257 of 2004 in Company
Petition No.139 of 1988, issued an advertisement in the newspaper inviting offers for sale of the
applicant's land along with other parcels of lands. On 6.12.2004, the applicant issued notice through
its advocate to the Official Liquidator stating that the applicant is the legal heir of the original owner
of the subject property and the Official Liquidator is only in de- facto possession of the subject
property and not entitled to sell the subject property. On 25.1.2005, by an order of the High Court,
the buildings and staff quarters were auctioned by the Official Liquidator and thereupon the
building and superstructure on the leasehold land were demolished.
10.6 In the meanwhile, judgment dated 17.10.2008 in the matter of Jabal C. Lashkari was delivered
by the Division Bench and following the said decision, O.J. Appeal No.1 of 2003 also came to be
dismissed. That against the said order, the applicants preferred S.L.P No.29632 of 2008 before the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 12Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
Supreme Court which by its order dated 16.12.2008 restrained the official liquidator from creating
any third party rights. Thereafter, by a judgment and order dated 29.3.2016, the Supreme Court set
aside the judgment of this court and remitted the matter for fresh consideration in accordance with
law.
10.7 That in view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, it has become necessary to correct the
description in the title by substituting the name of Official Liquidator, Ahmedabad Jubilee Mills
Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Jubilee Mills") for Ahmedabad Jubilee Spinning and
Manufacturing Mills Company Limited.
10.8 As regards prayer for payment of rent, it is submitted that since 1995 till date, no rent has been
paid despite direction given by the High Court by its judgment dated 23.10.2008 and arrears have
mounted to Rs.10,500/-. Moreover, the Official Liquidator has not paid municipal taxes and land
revenue which has now mounted to Rs.14.11 crores in terms of the AMC bill for the year 2015-16.
The applicant has also annexed all the documents referred to in the application along therewith.
11. Thus, in effect and substance, the reliefs prayed for in Company Application No.16 of 1999 and
Company Application No.358 of 2016 are more or less similar whereby the applicant seeks a
direction to the Official Liquidator to hand over peaceful and vacant possession of the property in
question and also seeks a direction to the Official Liquidator to pay the arrears of rent, mesne
profits, arrears of land revenue, municipal taxes that may be found due.
12. Ms. Megha Jani, learned counsel with Mr. M. I. Hava, learned advocate for the applicant,
submitted that initially, a lease was executed on 4th August 1911 by the lessor in favour of
Ahmedabad Manufacturing Company. By an agreement dated 29.03.1941, the rights under the said
lease deed came to be transferred in favour of Calico Limited, which by an unregistered agreement
dated 24.06.1983, has transferred the leasehold rights in favour of the Jubilee Mills. It was
submitted that the Official Liquidator of Jubilee Mills claims to be the lessee of the subject property
under the assignment deed of 1983 between Calico Limited and Gaurav Chemtax, which is an
unregistered document. It was submitted that the lease of 1911 is a yearly tenancy inasmuch as it
contemplates payment of rent annually. It was submitted that under section 107 of the Transfer of
Property Act, 1882 (hereinafter referred to as "the Transfer of Property Act"), a lease of immovable
property from year to year can be made only by a registered instrument. Furthermore, such lease
deed is also required to be registered under the provisions of section 17(1)(d) of the Registration Act,
1982 (hereinafter referred to as "the Registration Act"). It was submitted that the assignment deed
of 1983 being an unregistered document, no rights flow from such document, which, though
required to be registered, is not registered.
Therefore, to the extent, the agreement seeks to sublet the leasehold rights, it is not valid because it
is unregistered. In support of such submission, the learned counsel placed reliance upon the
decision of the Supreme Court in Anthony v. K. C. Ittoop & Sons, (2000) 6 SCC 394, wherein, it has
been held thus:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 13Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
"8. The lease deed relied on by the plaintiff was intended to be operative for a period
of five years. It is an unregistered instrument. Hence such an instrument cannot
create a lease on account of three-pronged statutory inhibitions. The first interdict is
contained in the first paragraph of Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882
(for short "the TP Act") which reads thus:
"107. A lease of immovable property from year to year, or for any term exceeding one
year, or reserving an yearly rent, can be made only by a registered instrument."
(emphasis supplied)
9. The second inhibition can be discerned from Section 17(1) of the Registration Act 1908 and it
reads thus: (only the material portion) "17. Documents of which registration is compulsory.--(1) The
following documents shall be registered, if the property to which they relate is situate in a district in
which, and if they have been executed on or after the date on which, Act XVI of 1864, or the Indian
Registration Act, 1866, or the Indian Registration Act, 1871, or the Indian Registration Act, 1877, or
this Act came or comes into force, namely:
(a)-(c) * * *
(d) leases of immovable property from year to year, or for any term exceeding one year, or reserving
an yearly rent;"
10. The third interdict is contained in Section 49 of the Registration Act which speaks
about the fatal consequence of non-compliance of Section 17 thereof.
Section 49 reads thus:
"49. Effect of non-registration of documents required to be registered.--No document
required by Section 17 or by any provision of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, to be
registered shall--
(a) affect any immovable property comprised therein, or
(b) confer any power to adopt, or
(c) be received as evidence of any transaction affecting such property or conferring
such power, unless it has been registered.
Provided that an unregistered document affecting immovable property and required by this Act, or
the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, to be registered may be received as evidence of a contract in a
suit for specific performance under Chapter II of the Specific Relief Act, 1877, or as evidence of part
performance of a contract for the purposes of Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, or
as evidence of any collateral transaction not required to be effected by registered instrument."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 14Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
No endeavour was made by the counsel to obviate thesaid interdict with the help of the exemptions
contained in the proviso.
11. The resultant position is insurmountable that so far as the instrument of lease is concerned there
is no scope for holding that the appellant is a lessee by virtue of the said instrument. The Court is
disabled from using the instrument as evidence and hence it goes out of consideration in this case,
hook, line and sinker (vide Shantabai v. State of Bombay, AIR 1958 SC 532, Satish Chand Makhan v.
Govardhan Das Byas, (1984) 1 SCC 369 and Bajaj Auto Ltd. v. Behari Lal Kohli, (1989) 4 SCC 39.
12. But the above finding does not exhaust the scope of the issue whether the appellant is a lessee of
the building. A lease of immovable property is defined in Section 105 of the TP Act. A transfer of a
right to enjoy a property in consideration of a price paid or promised to be rendered periodically or
on specified occasions is the basic fabric for a valid lease. The provision says that such a transfer can
be made expressly or by implication. Once there is such a transfer of right to enjoy the property a
lease stands created. What is mentioned in the three paragraphs of the first part of Section 107 of
the TP Act are only the different modes of how leases are created. The first para has been extracted
above and it deals with the mode of creating the particular kinds of leases mentioned therein. The
third para can be read along with the above as it contains a condition to be complied with if the
parties choose to create a lease as per a registered instrument mentioned therein. All other leases, if
created, necessarily fall within the ambit of the second para. Thus, dehors the instrument parties
can create a lease as envisaged in the second para of Section 107 which reads thus:
"All other leases of immovable property may be made either by a registered
instrument or by oral agreement accompanied by delivery of possession."
13. When lease is a transfer of a right to enjoy the property and such transfer can be made expressly
or by implication, the mere fact that an unregistered instrument came into existence would not
stand in the way of the court to determine whether there was in fact a lease otherwise than through
such deed.
14. When it is admitted by both sides that the appellant was inducted into the possession of the
building by the owner thereof and that the appellant was paying monthly rent or had agreed to pay
rent in respect of the building, the legal character of the appellant's possession has to be attributed
to a jural relationship between the parties. Such a jural relationship, on the fact-situation of this
case, cannot be placed anything different from that of lessor and lessee falling within the purview of
the second para of Section 107 of the TP Act extracted above. From the pleadings of the parties there
is no possibility for holding that the nature of possession of the appellant in respect of the building is
anything other than as a lessee."
12.1 It was submitted that as the lease is not registered, the provisions of the Transfer of Property
Act would not apply and the Official Liquidator is required to be treated as a statutory tenant and
the provisions of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 (hereinafter
referred to as "the Rent Act") would apply.

12.2 Reference was made to the decision of the Supreme Court in Bajaj Auto Ltd. v. Behari Lal Kohli,
(1989) 4 SCC 39, wherein, the Court held thus:
"5. It has been strenuously contended by the learned counsel for the appellant that as,
(i) the United Automobiles is a distributor of the product manufactured by the
appellant on the basis of commission, (ii) it pays the same amount to the appellant as
the rent of the premises payable by the appellant to the respondent, and (iii) is
entitled to be in possession only as long as it continues to be a distributor, it should
be held to be an "associate concern" within the meaning of the aforementioned term
of the lease. In reply to the respondent's contention that the term cannot be taken
into consideration as the deed is not a registered one, it was urged that the appellant,
in view of the provisions of Section 49 of the Registration Act, is entitled to rely upon
the term for "collateral purpose". The argument is that the document may not be
admissible for the purpose of proving the existence of a lease or the terms thereof,
but as the aforementioned clause does not come within that category, inasmuch as, it
merely amounts to a written permission to the appellant to create a sub-lease, it
cannot be excluded from consideration on the ground of non-registration.
6. There is no dispute that the appellant has put M/s United Automobiles in
possession of the premises and has thus parted with the possession within the
meaning of Section 14(1) proviso (b) of the Act. The appellant company has a
separate legal entity and has nothing to do with M/s United Automobiles except that
the latter is the dealer-distributor of some of its manufactured articles. M/s United
Automobiles is not a licensee and is not in possession of the premises on behalf of the
appellant. The monetary benefit available to the dealer is confined to the commission
it receives on the sale of every vehicle; and does not include the right of enjoyment of
the premises. The dealer pays a fixed sum as rent to the appellant and the rent is not
related or dependent on the sale of any vehicle. The fact that this amount is same as
what is paid by the appellant to the respondent does not appear to be material. The
irresistible conclusion is that the appellant has created a sub-lease in favour of its
dealer. The question now is whether the clause in the lease mentioned above amounts
to the respondent's consent in writing.
7. The contention of the learned counsel for the respondent that the aforesaid clause
cannot be looked into for want of registration or the lease deed appears to be correct.
Reliance has been placed on the observations of Fazl Ali, J., in Sachindra Mohan
Ghose v. Ramjash Agarwalla, (1988) 1 SCC 70, that if a decree purporting to create a
lease is inadmissible in evidence for want of registration, none of the terms of the
lease can be admitted in evidence and that to use a document for the purpose of
proving an important clause in the lease is not using it as a collateral purpose.
8. The learned counsel for the appellant attempted to meet the point by saying that so
far the consent of the landlord permitting sub-letting is concerned, it does not require
registration and the clause, therefore, must be excepted from the requirement of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 16Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
registration and consequent exclusion from evidence. We do not see any force in this
argument. The question whether a lessee is entitled to create a sub-lease or not is
undoubtedly a term of the transaction of lease, and if it is incorporated in the
document it cannot be disassociated from the lease and considered separately in
isolation. If a document is inadmissible for non-registration, all its terms are
inadmissible including the one dealing with landlord's permission to his tenant to
sub-let. It follows that the appellant cannot, in the present circumstances, be allowed
to rely upon the clause in his unregistered lease deed.
9. There is still another reason to hold that the aforesaid clause cannot come to the
aid of the appellant. A perusal of its language would show that it contains the
respondent's consent in general terms without reference to M/s United Automobiles.
As a matter of fact M/s United Automobiles came to be inducted as a sub-tenant
much later. Can such a general permission be treated to be the consent as required by
Section 14(1) proviso (b) of the Act? It was held by this Court in Shalimar Tar
Products v. S.C. Sharma that Sections 14(1) proviso (b) and 16(2) and (3) of the Delhi
Rent Control Act, 1958 enjoin the tenant to obtain consent of the landlord in writing
to the specific sub-letting and any other interpretation of the provisions will defeat
the object of the statute and is, therefore, impermissible. Since it is not suggested that
the consent of the respondent was obtained specifically with reference to the
sub-letting in favour of M/s United Automobiles, the clause in the lease deed, which
has been relied on cannot save the appellant, even if it be assumed in its favour that
the clause is admissible and the sub-lessee is appellant's associate concern. The
appeal, therefore, fails and is dismissed with costs."
12.3 It was submitted that in terms of the above decision, if a document is inadmissible for
non-registration, all its terms are inadmissible, including the one dealing with landlord's permission
to his tenant to sublet. Therefore, even if there is a tenant landlord relationship, the terms of the
lease deed of 1911 are not available to the Official Liquidator.
12.4 Reliance was also placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Samir Mukherjee v.
Davinder K. Bajaj, (2001) 5 SCC 259, wherein, the court held thus:
"4. To appreciate the respective contentions that have been put forward by the
learned counsel for the parties we extract below Sections 106 and 107 of the Act:
"106. Duration of certain leases in absence of written contract or local usage.--In the
absence of a contract or local law or usage to the contrary, a lease of immovable
property for agricultural or manufacturing purposes shall be deemed to be a lease
from year to year, terminable, on the part of either lessor or lessee, by six months'
notice expiring with the end of a year of the tenancy; and a lease of immovable
property for any other purpose shall be deemed to be a lease from month to month,
terminable, on the part of either lessor or lessee, by fifteen days' notice expiring with
the end of a month of tenancy.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 17Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
Every notice under this section must be in writing signed by or on behalf of the
person giving it and either be sent by post to the party who is intended to be bound
by it or be tendered or delivered personally to such partly, or to one of his family or
servants, at his residence, or (if such tender or delivery is not practicable) affixed to a
conspicuous part of the property.
107. Leases how made.--A lease of immovable property from year to year, or for any
term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent, can be made only by a registered
instrument.
All other leases of immovable property may be made either by a registered
instrument or by oral agreement accompanied by delivery of possession.
Where a lease of immovable property is made by a registered instrument, such
instrument or, where there are more instruments than one, each such instrument
shall be executed by both the lessor and the lessee;
Provided that the State Government may, from time to time, by notification in the
Official Gazette, direct that leases of immovable property, other than leases from year
to year, or for any term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent, or any class of
such leases, may be made by unregistered instrument or by oral agreement without
delivery of possession."
5. Section 106 lays down a rule of construction which is to apply when the parties have not
specifically agreed upon as to whether the lease is yearly or monthly. On a plain reading of this
section it is clear that the legislature has classified leases into two categories according to their
purposes and this section would be attracted to construe the duration of a valid lease in the absence
of a contract or local law or usage to the contrary. Where the parties by a contract have indicated the
duration of a lease, this section would not apply. What this section does is to prescribe the duration
of the period of different kinds of leases by legal fiction -- leases for agricultural or manufacturing
purposes shall be deemed to be lease from year to year and all other leases shall be deemed to be
from month to month. Existence of a valid lease is a prerequisite to invoke the rule of construction
embodied in Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act.
6. Section 107 prescribes the procedure for execution of a lease between the parties. Under the first
para of this section a lease of immovable property from year to year or for any term exceeding one
year or reserving a yearly rent can be made only by a registered instrument and remaining classes of
leases are governed by the second para, that is to say all other leases of immovable property can be
made either by a registered instrument or by an oral agreement accompanied by delivery of
possession.
7. In the case in hand we are concerned with an oral lease which is hit by the first para of Section 107
of the Transfer of Property Act. Under Section 107 parties have an option to enter into a lease in
respect of an immovable property either for a term less than a year or from year to year, for any term
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 18Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
exceeding one year or reserving a yearly rent. If they decide upon having a lease in respect of any
immovable property from year to year or for any term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent,
such a lease has to be only by a registered instrument. In the absence of a registered instrument no
valid lease from year to year or for a term exceeding one year or reserving a yearly rent can be
created. If the lease is not a valid lease within the meaning of the opening words of Section 106 the
rule of construction embodied therein would not be attracted. The above is the legal position on a
harmonious reading of both the sections.
8. In Ram Kumar Das, AIR 1952 SC 23, Section 106 was considered by a Bench of four Judges of this
Court.
This Court held that this Section 106 lays down the rule of construction which is to be applied when
there is no period agreed upon between the parties and in such cases duration has to be determined
by reference to the object for the purpose for which tenancy is created. It was also held that the rule
of construction embodied in this section applies not only to express leases of uncertain duration but
also to leases implied by law which may be inferred from possession and acceptance of rent and
other circumstances. It was further held that it is not disputed that a contract to the contrary as
contemplated by Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act need not be an express contract; it may
be implied, but it certainly should be a valid contract. On the facts of the case, the Court held (at AIR
p. 27, para 13) that "the difficulty in applying this rule to the present case arises from the fact that a
tenancy from year to year or reserving an yearly rent can be made only by registered instrument, as
laid down in Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act".
(emphasis supplied)
9. In a recent decision of this Court in Janki Devi Bhagat Trust, (1995) 5 SCC 314, this Court held
that under Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act a lease of immovable property from year to
year or for a term exceeding one year can be made only by a registered instrument and any lease of
this kind would be void unless it is so created.
10. In the present case though the appellant has claimed that it was a lease for manufacturing
purpose, admittedly there was no registered written lease. Therefore, the rule of construction as
envisaged in Section 106 would not be applicable as the statutory requirement of Section 107 of the
Act has not been satisfied. The plea of the appellant that 15 days' notice terminating the present
tenancy is bad in law would not be sustainable.
12.5 Reference was made to the decision of the Supreme Court in K. B. Saha & Sons (P) Ltd. v.
Development Consultant Ltd., (2008) 8 SCC 564, wherein, the Supreme Court culled out the
following principles:
"34. From the principles laid down in the various decisions of this Court and the High
Courts, as referred to hereinabove, it is evident that:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 19Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
1. A document required to be registered, if unregistered is not admissible into
evidence under Section 49 of the Registration Act.
2. Such unregistered document can however be used as an evidence of collateral
purpose as provided in the proviso to Section 49 of the Registration Act.
3. A collateral transaction must be independent of, or divisible from, the transaction
to effect which the law required registration.
4. A collateral transaction must be a transaction not itself required to be effected by a
registered document, that is, a transaction creating, etc. any right, title or interest in
immovable property of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards.
5. If a document is inadmissible in evidence for want of registration, none of its terms
can be admitted in evidence and that to use a document for the purpose of proving an
important clause would not be using it as a collateral purpose."
12.6 It was submitted that the agreement of 1983 is the agreement on the basis of which Jubilee
Mills claims leasehold rights. Such document is inadmissible in evidence for want of registration,
and hence, none of its terms can be admitted in evidence and that use of the document for the
purpose of proving an important clause would not be using it as a collateral purpose.
12.7 Reliance was placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Park Street Properties (P) Ltd.
v. Dipak Kumar Singh, (2016) 9 SCC 268, wherein, the Court held thus:
"10. The learned Senior Counsel Mr Sundaram further places reliance on the decision
of this Court in K.B. Saha & Sons (P) Ltd. v. Development Consultant Ltd., (2008) 8
SCC 564, wherein it was held as under:
"34. From the principles laid down in the various decisions of this Court and the High
Courts, as referred to hereinabove, it is evident that:
1. A document required to be registered, if unregistered, is not admissible into
evidence under Section 49 of the Registration Act.
2. Such unregistered document can however be used as an evidence of collateral
purpose as provided in the proviso to Section 49 of the Registration Act.
3. A collateral transaction must be independent of, or divisible from, the transaction
to effect which the law required registration.
4. A collateral transaction must be a transaction not itself required to be effected by a
registered document, that is, a transaction creating, etc. any right, title or interest in
immovable property of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards.

5. If a document is inadmissible in evidence for want of registration, none of its terms
can be admitted in evidence and that to use a document for the purpose of proving an
important clause would not be using it as a collateral purpose.
35. In our view, the particular clause in the lease agreement in question cannot be
called a collateral purpose. As noted earlier, it is the case of the appellant that the suit
premises were let out only for the particular named officer of the respondent and
accordingly, after the same was vacated by the said officer, the respondent was not
entitled to allot it to any other employee and was therefore, liable to be evicted,
which, in our view, was an important term forming part of the lease agreement.
Therefore, such a clause, namely, Clause 9 of the lease agreement in this case, cannot
be looked into even for collateral purposes to come to a conclusion that the
respondent was liable to be evicted because of violation of Clause 9 of the lease
agreement. That being the position, we are unable to hold that Clause 9 of the lease
agreement, which is admittedly unregistered, can be looked into for the purpose of
evicting the respondent from the suit premises only because the respondent was not
entitled to induct any other person other than the named officer in the same."
16. At the outset, it would be useful to refer to the statutory provisions at play in the instant case,
which are Sections 106 and 107 of the Act, which read as under:
"106.Duration of certain leases in absence of written contract or local usage.--In the
absence of a contract or local law or usage to the contrary, a lease of immovable
property for agricultural or manufacturing purposes shall be deemed to be a lease
from year to year, terminable, on the part of either lessor or lessee, by six months'
notice expiring with the end of a year of tenancy; and a lease of immovable property
for any other purpose shall be deemed to be a lease from month to month,
terminable, on the part of either lessor or lessee, by fifteen days' notice expiring with
the end of a month of tenancy.
Every notice under this section must be in writing signed by or on behalf of the
person giving it and either be sent by post to the party who is intended to be bound
by it or be tendered or delivered personally to such party, or to one of his family or
servants, at his residence, or (if such tender or delivery is not practicable) affixed to a
conspicuous part of the property.
107. Leases how made.--A lease of immovable property from year to year, or for any
term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent, can be made only by a registered
instrument.
All other leases of immovable property may be made either by a registered
instrument or by oral agreement accompanied by delivery of possession.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 21Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
Where a lease of immovable property is made by a registered instrument, such
instrument or, where there are more instruments than one, each such instrument
shall be executed by both the lessor and the lessee:
Provided that the State Government may, from time to time, by notification in the
Official Gazette, direct that leases of immovable property, other than leases from year
to year, or for any term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent, or any class of
such leases, may be made by unregistered instrument or by oral agreement without
delivery of possession."
(emphasis supplied)
17. A perusal of Section 106 of the Act makes it clear that it creates a deemed monthly tenancy in
those cases where there is no express contract to the contrary, which is terminable at a notice period
of 15 days. The section also lays down the requirements of a valid notice to terminate the tenancy,
such as that it must be in writing, signed by the person sending it and be duly delivered. Admittedly,
the validity of the notice itself is not under challenge. The main contention advanced on behalf of the
respondents is that the impugned judgment and order is valid in light of the second part of Section
107 of the Act, which requires that lease for a term exceeding one year can only be made by way of a
registered instrument.
18. At this stage, it will also be useful to examine Clause 6 of the agreement dated 7-8-2006, which
reads as under:
"6. Default.-- In the event of any default on the part of the tenants in making payment
of the rent for 3 consecutive months or in the event of any breach of any of the terms
and conditions herein contained and on the part of the tenants to be performed and
observed and the landlord shall be entitled to serve a notice on call upon the tenants
to make payment of the rent and to remedy for the breach of any of the remaining
terms and conditions herein contained and if within a period of 30 days, the tenants
shall fail to remedy the breach, the landlord shall be entitled to determine or
terminate the tenancy."
(emphasis supplied) Thus, in terms of Clause 6 of the agreement, the landlord was entitled to
terminate the tenancy in case there was a breach of the terms of the agreement or in case of
non-payment of rent for three consecutive months and the tenants failed to remedy the same within
a period of thirty days of the receipt of the notice. The abovesaid clause of the agreement is clearly
contrary to the provisions of Section 106 of the Act. While Section 106 of the Act does contain the
phrase "in the absence of a contract to the contrary", it is a well-settled position of law, as pointed
out by the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant that the same must be a valid
contract.
19. It is also a well-settled position of law that in the absence of a registered instrument, the courts
are not precluded from determining the factum of tenancy from the other evidence on record as well
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 22Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
as the conduct of the parties. A three-Judge Bench of this Court in Anthony v. K.C. Ittoop & Sons,
(2000) 6 SCC 394, held as under:
"12. ... A lease of immovable property is defined in Section 105 of the TP Act. A
transfer of a right to enjoy a property in consideration of a price paid or promised to
be rendered periodically or on specified occasions is the basic fabric for a valid lease.
The provision says that such a transfer can be made expressly or by implication. Once
there is such a transfer of right to enjoy the property, a lease stands created. What is
mentioned in the three paragraphs of the first part of Section 107 of the TP Act are
only the different modes of how leases are created. The first paragraph has been
extracted above and it deals with the mode of creating the particular kinds of leases
mentioned therein. The third paragraph can be read along with the above as it
contains a condition to be complied with if the parties choose to create a lease as per
a registered instrument mentioned therein. All other leases, if created, necessarily fall
within the ambit of the second paragraph. Thus, dehors the instrument parties can
create a lease as envisaged in the second paragraph of Section 107 which reads thus.
...
13. When lease is a transfer of a right to enjoy the property and such transfer can be
made expressly or by implication, the mere fact that an unregistered instrument
came into existence would not stand in the way of the court to determine whether
there was in fact a lease otherwise than through such deed.
* * *
16. Taking a different view would be contrary to the reality when parties clearly
intended to create a lease though the document which they executed had not gone
into the processes of registration. That lacuna had affected the validity of the
document, but what had happened between the parties in respect of the property
became a reality. Non-registration of the document had caused only two
consequences. One is that no lease exceeding one year was created. Second is that the
instrument became useless so far as creation of the lease is concerned. Nonetheless
the presumption that a lease not exceeding one year stood created by conduct of
parties remains unrebutted."
(emphasis supplied) Thus, in the absence of registration of a document, what is deemed to be
created is a month-to-month tenancy, the termination of which is governed by Section 106 of the
Act.
20. Thus, the question of remanding the matter back to the trial court to consider it afresh in view of
the fact that the same has been admitted in evidence, as the High Court has done in the impugned
judgment and order, does not arise at all. While the agreement dated 7-8- 2006 can be admitted in
evidence and even relied upon by the parties to prove the factum of the tenancy, the terms of the
same cannot be used to derogate from the statutory provision of Section 106 of the Act, which
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 23Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
creates a fiction of tenancy in the absence of a registered instrument creating the same. If the
argument advanced on behalf of the respondents is taken to its logical conclusion, this lease can
never be terminated, save in cases of breach by the tenant. Accepting this argument would mean
that in a situation where the tenant does not default on rent payment for three consecutive months,
or does not commit a breach of the terms of the lease, it is not open to the lessor to terminate the
lease even after giving a notice. This interpretation of Clause 6 of the agreement cannot be permitted
as the same is wholly contrary to the express provisions of the law. The phrase "contract to the
contrary" in Section 106 of the Act cannot be read to mean that the parties are free to contract out of
the express provisions of the law, thereby defeating its very intent. As is evident from the cases
relied upon by the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, the relevant
portions of which have been extracted supra, the contract between the parties must be in relation to
a valid contract for the statutory right under Section 106 of the Act available to a lessor to terminate
the tenancy at a notice of 15 days to not be applicable."
12.8 Reliance was placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Garware Wall Ropes Limited v.
Coastal Marine Constructions and Engineering Limited, (2019) 9 SCC 209, wherein the court held
that when an arbitration clause is contained "in a contract", it is significant that the agreement only
becomes a contract if it is enforceable in law. Under the Stamp Act, an agreement does not become a
contract, namely, that it is not enforceable in law, unless it is duly stamped. Therefore, even a plain
reading of section 11(6-A), when read with section 7(2) of the 1996 Act and section 2(h) of the
Contract Act, would make it clear that an arbitration clause in an agreement would not exist when it
is not enforceable by law.
12.9 Reliance was also placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Suraj Lamp & Industries
(P) Ltd. (2) v. State of Haryana, (2012) 1 SCC 656: wherein, it has been held that a lease can be
validly transferred only under a registered assignment of lease.
12.10 It was accordingly contended that the sub-lease, assignment, transfer in favour of Gaurav
Chemtex / Jubilee Mills is unlawful because: (i) it violates provisions of the Registration Act as well
as the Transfer of Property Act because it is not registered; (ii) it also violates the provisions of the
Rent Act because Calico Limited itself was a sub-lessee and the original lessee was Ahmedabad
Manufacturing Company which assigned it to Calico Limited in 1941. Therefore, the status of Calico
Limited was that of a sub-lessee and a sub- lessee cannot further sub-let under the provisions of the
Rent Act.
12.11 It was submitted that there is no privity of contract between the lessors and Jubilee Mills. The
Official Liquidator of Jubilee Mills claims to sell leasehold rights on account of assignments relying
on the original lease deed of 1911. It was submitted that considering the fact that the so-called
assignment deed of 1983 is unregistered, the Official Liquidator does not step into the shoes of the
original lessee viz., Ahmedabad Manufacturing Company or Calico Limited. It was submitted that
there is no contract between the lessors and Jubilee Mills and the terms of lease deed of 1911 are not
available to Jubilee Mills, who claims to be an assignee on the basis of an unregistered document.
Therefore, the Official Liquidator of Jubilee Mills can only claim protection qua his possession as a
statutory tenant under the provisions of the Rent Act.

12.12 The attention of the court was invited to the provisions of sub-section (11) of section 5 of the
Rent Act, which defines 'tenant' to mean any person by whom or on whose account rent is payable
for any premises and includes -
(a) such sub-tenants and other persons as have derived title under a tenant before the
commencement of the Bombay Rents Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Amendment
Ordinance, 1959. It was submitted that the Rent Act prohibits sublease unless it is as per section 15
of the Rent Act, that is, unless it is so provided in the contract. Therefore, in the present case, it is
not open to the Official Liquidator of Jubilee Mills to rely on the terms of the contract of 04.08.1911
for the simple reason that he claims assignment of tenancy rights on the basis of an unregistered
agreement which cannot be read in evidence.
12.13 It was submitted that sub-section (1) of section 15 of the Rent Act provides that
notwithstanding anything contained in any law, but subject to any contract to the contrary, it shall
not be lawful after the coming into operation of the Act for any tenant to sub-let the whole or any
part of the premises let to him or to assign or transfer in any other manner his interest therein.
Therefore, sub-section (1) of section 15 of the Bombay Rent Act ousts the operation of any other law.
It was submitted that while the prohibition against sub-letting in sub-section (1) of section 15 of the
Rent Act is subject to a contract to the contrary, in the present case, while the original lease deed of
1911 permits sub-letting, the Official Liquidator of Jubilee Mills cannot fall back upon the clauses of
the said agreement as he is claiming tenancy on the basis of an unregistered document.
12.14 Next, it was submitted that the transfer/assignment of 1983 in favour of the Jubilee Mills is in
breach of the provisions of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 (hereinafter referred
to as "the ULC Act"), section 6(h) of the Transfer of Property Act, section 17 read with section 49 of
the Registration Act, section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act and in breach of the Contract Act,
1872, being opposed to law and public policy, and hence, the same is unlawful as contemplated
under section 13(1)(e) of the Rent Act and is, therefore, the Official Liquidator of Jubilee Mills is
liable to be evicted from the subject property.
12.15 Referring to the terms of the lease of 1911, it was submitted that the terms and conditions
thereof contemplate transfer of leasehold rights only as a going concern. In this regard the attention
of the court was drawn to clauses 6 and 2 thereof read with the recitals of the lease deed.
12.16 It was pointed out that the sub-lease in favour of the Gaurav Chemtex/Jubilee Mills is by
Calico Limited, which itself was a sub-lessee. It was submitted that sub-section (2) of section 15 of
the Rent Act protects only sub-lease or assignment or transfer by assignees or transferees. It does
not protect any further lease or transfer by a sub-lessee. In other words, a sub-lessee cannot sub-let.
In support of such submission, reliance was placed upon the decision of the Bombay High Court in
N. M. Nayak v. Chhotalal, AIR 1968 Bombay 51, wherein, the court held thus:
"(31) Much argument was advanced on the construction of section 15(1) of the Act. It may be
recalled that Hegde was the lessee under the landlords. He assigned the business to one Salian on
July 22, 1954 and the latter assigned the same to the petitioner on February 22, 1965. The landlords
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 25Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
then terminated the tenancy on May 26, 1965. It was contended that Salian was a tenant within the
meaning of section 15(11) (a) and (aa) and if so, under section 15(1) he had a right to assign the
business to the petitioner. According to Mr. Singhvi the word "tenant" in section 15(1) must have the
same meaning as given to it by section 15(11) . It is argued that if the word "tenant" in section 15 is
construed as a contractual tenant, then difficulty would also arise in the application of section 13 (e)
of the Act, for then that section also must be limited to such a tenant and any other person cannot be
evicted.
(32) Even if this meaning were given to the word "tenant" in section 15(1) the contention must fail
for the reasons mentioned earlier. It is under the proviso to section 15(1) read with the relevant
notification of the Government that the right of assignment the business arises, and not otherwise.
Since the proviso itself is intended to except such leases or class of leases any may be specified,
unless what is assigned is a lease by the lessee, the assignment must be held to be bad. Apart from
that the notification itself is limited in scope as stated above.
(33) The expression 'tenant' employed in this sub- section means the contractual tenant and not the
statutory tenant. See Anand Nivas Private, Ltd., v. Anandji Kalyanji's Pedhi,. Therefore the
Legislature did not intend to extend any protection to the tenants of the sub-tenants or to assignees
or transferees of the sub- tenants or to the sub-tenants, assignees or transferees of the assignees or
transferees by introducing the proviso to that sub-section authorising the Government to issue
notification granting sub-leases.
(34) Similar contention was raised in and rejected. Mr. Justice Shah says (in para 34):
"The argument that by restricting the operation of section 13(1)(e) to contractual
tenants sub-letting by statutory tenants would be protected is without force. Section
12 and 13(1) have to be read together. Clause (e) of section 13(1) entitles a landlord to
obtain possession where a contractual tenant has during premises or assigned or
transferred his interest therein. Where a statutory tenant has purported to sublet the
premises, or has purported to assign or transfer his interest therein, and in pursuance
of such a transaction parted with possession he would forthwith forfeit the protection
which the statute accords to him by section 12(1)"
(35) In a case like the present so far as the first tenant is concerned if his sub-letting or assignment
is contrary to the Act, he would be evicted. If the assignee of an assignee of the lease is not a tenant,
as we have held that he is not, he is not protected and must be evicted. So far as the first tenant and
his assignee are concerned, there is nothing to protect as they are not in possession. At best, Salian
was a "tenant" but as he assigned to the petitioner he cannot be protected.
(36) It was argued that if section 15(1) cannot apply an assignee of a tenant has an estate or interest
in the property and therefore he would be entitled to assign it to another under the Transfer of
Property Act and therefore the petitioner cannot be evicted. The contention overlooks the very
provisions of section 15(1) of the Act which operates "notwithstanding anything contained in any
law". The effect is that the Transfer of Property Act must stand abrogated in view of the restrictions
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 26Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
regarding assignment and sub-letting contained in section15 (1) read with the proviso. The rights of
the lessee to assign the lease or sub-let would therefore be only such as is permitted by section 15(1)
and its proviso. This was decided in Chimanlal Ganpatdas v. Subashchandra Premsukh Hati C.R. A.
No. 157 of 1955 D/-8-2-1956 (Bom) by Shah J., and we respectfully agree with the same."
"(40) The last contention urged by Mr. Singhvi was that even if we hold that the
assignment in favour of the petitioner was unlawful, the petitioner is entitled to claim
immunity by virtue of sections 15(2) of the Rent Act, Section 15(2) of the Rent Act
provides:
"15(2) The prohibition against the sub-letting of the whole or any part of the premises
which have been let to any tenant, and against the assignment or transfer in any
other manner of the interest of the tenant therefore contained in sub-section (1) shall,
subject to the provisions of this sub-section, be deemed to have had no effect before
the commencement of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control
(Amendment) Ordinance, 1959 in any area in which this Act was in operation before
which this Act was in operation before such commencement; and accordingly,
notwithstanding anything contained in any contract or in the judgment decree or
order of a Court, any such sub-lease, assignment or transfer in favour or any such
purported sub-lease, assignment or transfer in favour of any person who has entered
into possession despite the prohibition in sub- section (1) as a purported sub-lessee,
assignee or transferee and has continued in possession at the commencement of the
said Ordinance, shall be deemed to be valid and effectual for all purposes and any
tenant who has sub-let any premises or part thereof, assigned or transferred any
interest therein., shall not be liable to eviction under clause
(e) of sub-section (1) of section 13".
Sub-section (2) partially nullifies the bar against sub-letting, assignment or transfer imposed by
sub- section (1) or by any contract or judgment with retrospective effect, provided the sub-lessee,
transferee or assignee has entered into possession prior to the commencement of the Bombay Rent
Ordinance III of 1959, i.e., prior to May 21, 1959 and has continued to remain in such possession of
such date. The protection sought to be afforded by this sub-section extends to sub-lessee, assignee
or transferee and does not extend to sub-lessee of sub-lessee or assignee or transferee or to assignee
of sub-lessee or assignee or transferee. As observed earlier, in Anand Nivas Pvt. Ltd., case, the
Supreme Court has held that section 15(1) applies to a contractual tenant or lessee. The transferee of
a lessee is not a contractual tenant. The Legislature whilst introducing sub-section (2) intended to
validate the sub-letting transfer and assignment by tenants and not further sub-letting or further
derivative transfer or assignment by such sub- lessees, transferees or assignees. In our opinion the
protection intended to be conferred by the Ordinance can be availed of by only those persons who
can be described as sub-lessees, assignees or transferees from the contractual tenant. Our attention
was invited to the judgment of Mr. Justice Chandrachud in Balkrishna Maruti v. Saidanna Sayanna,
where similar observations as to construction of section 15(2) of the Rent Act have been made. We,
therefore, hold that the Court below was right in holding that the petitioner was not entitled to claim
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 27Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
any protection by virtue of section 15(2) of the Rent Act."
12.17 The learned counsel further placed reliance upon the decision of the Supreme Court in
Jaisingh Morarji v. Sovani (P) Ltd., (1973) 1 SCC 197, wherein, the court held thus:
"14. The matter does not rest there because of the second limb of sub-section (2) of
Section 15 of the Act. It is provided there that any such sub-lease, assignment or
transfer or any such purported sub-lease, assignment or transfer in favour of any
person who has entered into possession before 1959 and has continued to be in
possession shall be deemed to be valid and effective. Therefore, the sub-letting before
1959 by a tenant is valid under sub-section (2) provided such sub-lessee entered into
possession and continued in possession at the commencement of the Ordinance.
Such sub-letting is rendered valid notwithstanding anything contained in any
contract or any decreeor order of Court. The Act as a corollary also introduced the
measure that any tenant who has sub-let shall not be liable to eviction under Section
13(1)(a) of the Act.
15. The proviso and the explanation to Section 15(1) of the Act protect transfer of
interest in notified leases or class of leases to assignees or transferees as well as
subsequent assignees or transferees. Section 15(2) of the Act protects only sub-lease
or assignment or transfer by the tenant but does not protect subsequent assignments
or transfers by assignees or transferees.
16. The entire question in the present appeal is whether the Private Company is a
sub-lessee protected under Section 15(2) of the Act.
17. The answer to the question is whether the respondent Private Company was a
sub-tenant prior to 1959 and continued in possession at the commencement of the
Ordinance in 1959. Ochhavlal in the present case gave the sub-lease to Sovani before
the Ordinance. It is an indisputable feature in the present case that Sovani did not
continue in possession at the commencement of the Ordinance of 1959. Sovani
became a Director of the Private Company. It is the Private Company which claims to
be a sublessee. The Private Company was in the first place not a sub-lessee of the
tenant but a subsequent assignee from the sub-lessee. Secondly Sovani who was the
sub-lessee was not in possession on the date of the Ordinance on May 21, 1959. It was
the Private Company which was in possession. Therefore, the Private Company is not
within the protection of Section 15(2) of the Act.
18. Section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act provides that a lessee may transfer
absolutely by way of mortgage or sub-lease the whole or any part of his interest in the
property, and any transferee of such interest or part may again transfer it. This
provision contained in Section 108(j) of the Transfer of Property Act notices the
distinction between the sub-lease by a lessee and transfer by such sub-lessee of his
interest by a subsequent transfer. Section 15 of the Bombay Act dealt with only
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 28Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
sub-letting by the tenant. That sub-letting by the tenant is no longer unlawful
provided the conditions in Section 15(2) are fulfilled. It is only the sub-lease by the
tenant which is mentioned in sub-section (1) and rendered valid in sub-section (2) of
Section 15 of the Act. The Bombay Rent Act does not in Section 15(2) protect any
further lease or transfer by the sub-lessee.
19. The Bombay High Court in a Bench decision in N.M. Nayak v. Chhotalal Hariram
rightly held that Section 15(2) of the Act validated only sub-letting, transfer and
assignment by tenants and no further sub-letting or further derivative transfer or
assignment by such sub- lessees, transferees or assignees.
20. The word "tenant" in Section 15 of the Bombay Act means the contractual tenant.
In Anand Nivas (P) Ltd. v. Anandji this Court said that the expression "tenant" in
Section 15(1) of the Act means the contractual tenant and not the statutory tenant.
The legislature by the Ordinance of 1959 intended to confer protection on sub-
tenants of contractual tenants. The Ordinance did not confer any protection on
further transfer or further sub- letting by sub-lessees of the contractual tenants."
[Emphasis supplied] 12.18 Reliance was also placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in
Shantibai v. Dinkar Balkrishna Vaidya, (1994) 4 SCC 85, wherein the court held thus:
"14. These sub-lessees (defendants 2 and 3) assigned their rights in favour of
defendants 6, 7 and 8 and others who are the appellants. How can they claim
protection as sub-lessees? The important point to note here is that the original lessor
(sic lessee) Gore, defendants 2 and 3 sub- lessees are no longer before us. They have
not filed the appeal. In these circumstances, the principle applicable to this case is as
stated in Jai Singh Morarji case that a sub-tenant cannot create further sub-tenancy.
Therefore, we are totally unable to see any scope for application of Section 15 of the
Act. The parties are afforded liberty to contract out of the section. Even then it is only
a sub- tenant who could claim protection. If in law, they are not sub-tenants of the
original lessor, this section is totally inapplicable.
15. Again for the application of Section 14, there must be a lawful sub-tenancy. That is
not so here. The occupants were not lawfully inducted into possession as sub-tenants
either prior to 1959 or 1973. Therefore, we are unable to accept the contention urged
by Mr U.R. Lalit and Mr S.K. Dholakia, learned counsel. Hence, that section is also
inapplicable.
12.19 It was submitted that the Official Liquidator cannot further transfer or assign or
sub-let the subject property as he is definitely a sub-tenant and, therefore, any
further assignment on his part would amount to unlawful assignment. It was
submitted that even under section 15 of the Rent Act, assuming that there was a valid
agreement, the Official Liquidator cannot further sub-let the subject property.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 29Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
12.20 Reference was made to section 19 of the Rent Act to submit that irrespective of
the nature of the tenancy, whether contractual or statutory whatsoever, section 19 of
the Rent Act imposes a blanket ban on the tenant or any other person in occupation
from taking "any consideration" whether in cash or kind as a condition precedent to
transfer or assignment of the rights of the tenant in the premises. It was urged that
section 19 forms a part of the public policy enunciated by the legislature, whereby,
the purpose of the section was to ensure that no tenant or any other person in
occupation of any premises is able to charge any consideration (popularly known as
"Pagdi" in Mumbai) for transfer or assignment of his rights in the premises so as to
stop the exploitation. It was submitted that the section further provides for a blanket
ban on charging of consideration except for where the premises are assigned as a
going concern as provided under the proviso to section 15 and the notification
thereunder.
12.21 It was further submitted that the notification, unlike the word "Tenant" which
is defined under the Rent Act, uses the word "lessee", which is defined under the
Transfer of Property Act and which only includes direct lessee under the contract and
not a sub-tenant or a sub-lessee or his transferees. Hence, the benefit of the
notification is conferred by law only to contractual lessees who are in occupation of
the premises.
12.22 It was submitted that since no person, including the tenant can charge any
consideration for further transfer or assignment, there is no value which can be
attached to such property and that in the absence of such value, the Official
Liquidator is not going to transfer or assign the premises free of cost. It was
submitted that under section 18 of the Rent Act, there is a ban imposed on the
landlord from charging any consideration or premium for letting the property which
is again the intention of the legislature in line with the object of the Rent Act. It was
submitted that the provisions of the Rent Act impose a ban on landlord and the
provisions of section 19 impose the ban on tenants; thereby, there is a balancing act
undertaken by the legislature to implement the public policy as reflected in these two
sections. It was submitted that in view of the aforesaid, neither the landlord can
charge any amount or premium for letting nor the tenant can charge any
consideration for the transfer or assignment of its rights. It was contended that
therefore, the Official Liquidator cannot transfer the leasehold rights because: (i) he
is a statutory tenant as transfer in his favour is by an unregistered document; (ii) the
Official Liquidator is a sub-tenant and cannot further sub-lease; (iii) sub-lease
assignment or transfer for a premium is prohibited and punishable under the
Bombay Rent Act; and (iv) Tenancy rights of a statutory tenant is not an asset of a
company in liquidation. In support of such submission, learned counsel placed
reliance upon the decision of the Delhi High Court in Official Liquidator of M/s Globe
Associate (P) Ltd. (In Liqn) v. H.P. Sharma, ILR (1971) 1 Delhi, wherein, the court
held thus:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 30Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
"1) This case has come up before us on a reference made by. one of us on an
application filed by the Official Liquidator on 22-10-1969 under Section 457(1)(c) of
the Companies Act. 1956 for permission to sell tenancy rights of certain premises viz.,
basement portion of a building at 4/9 Asaf Ali Road, New Delhi which was being held
by a company of which the Official Liquidator was the Liquidator appointed by this
Court on 7-3-1969 in Company petition No. 78 of 1968, on a monthly rental of Rs.
300.00 (2) It is not disputed that the tenancy held by the company viz. Globe
Associates Private Limited (now in liquidation) and which will hereafter be referred
to as the "tenant company", was a monthly tenancy and had not been determined by
the land-lord, Shri H. P. Sharma, who will hereafter be referred to as the respondent.
The tenancy was not for a fixed period and was, therefore, subject to the provisions of
the Delhi Rent Control Act, 59 of 1958." The said Act will hereafter be referred 'to as
the Rent Act."
"(3) The case of the Official Liquidator who will hereafter be referred to as the
applicant, is that the tenant-
company is not doing any business nor are the premises otherwise required by him for the beneficial
winding up of the company. The said tenancy rights are, however. valuable and are also transferable
and are likely to fetch to the company huge amounts if they are ordered to be auctioned or sold by
private contract or otherwise, as may be determined by this Court. The application also states that
the tenancy rights are still subsisting. Permission for sale of such tenancy has, therefore, been
sought by the applicant."
"(21) One of the points that emerges from the above discussion is whether the sale by
the liquidator is a sale by the Court or by operation of law. The contention urged by
the learned counsel for the applicant is that under Section 456(1) as soon as an order
of winding up is made the liquidator is required to take into his custody or under his
control any property, effects or actionable claim to which the company is, or appears
to be, entitled.
Under sub-section (2) the property and effects of the company shall be deemed to be in the custody
of the Court as from the date of the order for the winding up of the company. The property,
therefore, vests in the Court and if under Section 457(1)(c) the Liquidator is required to sell that
property, with the sanction of the Court, the transfer is by operation of law. The Official Liquidator
acts on behalf of the Court and not on behalf of the company. The action is, therefore, the action of
the Court.
(22) There are two fallacies in this argument. Firstly, when a company is being wound up its
property does not vest in the Court. Secondly, when the property is ordered by the court to be sold
the sale is not by operation of law."
"(40) It seems to us that the decision does not which the point with which we are
concerned in this case. It is true that under Section 14(1) (b) of the Rent Act it is open
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 31Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
to a landlord to permit the lessee to sublet, assign or otherwise part with possession
of whole or any part of the premises on or after the 9th day of June 1952 after
obtaining his consent in writing. But so long as that consent in writing is not given,
Section 16(2) states that the premises could not be lawfully sublet. If the tenant has
sublet the premises without obtaining the consent in writing of the landlord the
tenant becomes liable to be evicted under Section 48(2) and he also becomes liable to
be punished with fine which may extend to Rs.
1,000.00. Sub-section 3 of Section 5 renders the tenant or any person acting or purporting to act on
his behalf or a sub-tenant claiming or receiving any payment in consideration of the
relinquishments, transfer or assignment of his tenancy or sub-tenancy, guilty of an offence and
makes its contravention punishable with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to six
months or with fine which may extend to a sum which exceeds the amount or value of un-lawful
charge claimed or received under the said sub-section by Rs. 5,000.00 or with both.
(41) If the Official Liquidator, therefore, acting on behalf of the company sublets these premises,
Section 1 of the Rent Act would render those premises as not have been lawfully sub-let and
therefore made the sub-tenant or the transferee liable to be evicted there from. The action of the
Liquidator would also render the company liable to fine under Section 48(2); but if while doing so,
the Official Liquidator receives money in consideration of the transfer, or assignment of his tenancy
.or sub-tenancy and that is an unlawful charge under S. 5(3) of the Act, the company or the
Liquidator, as the case may be, would become liable to punishment under S. 48(1)(b)."
12.23 Reliance was also placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Singer India Ltd. v.
Chander Mohan Chadha, (2004) 7 SCC 1, wherein the court held thus:
"5. Before adverting to the contentions raised at the Bar, it will be convenient to
reproduce Section 14(1)(b) of the Act, which reads as under:
"14. Protection of tenant against eviction.--(1) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in any other law or contract, no order or decree for the recovery of
possession of any premises shall be made by any court or Controller in favour of the
landlord against a tenant:
Provided that the Controller may, on an application made to him in the prescribed
manner, make an order for the recovery of possession of the premises on one or more
of the following grounds only, namely--
(a) * * *
(b) that the tenant has, on or after the 9th day of June, 1952, sub-let, assigned or
otherwise parted with the possession of the whole or any part of the premises without
obtaining the consent in writing of the landlord;"
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 32Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
There is no ambiguity in the section and it clearly says that if, without obtaining the consent in
writing of the landlord the tenant has, on or after 9-6-1952 (i) sub-let, or (ii) assigned, or (iii)
otherwise parted with the possession of the whole or any part of the premises, he would be liable for
eviction. The applicability of the section depends upon occurrence of a factual situation, namely,
sub-letting or assignment or otherwise parting with possession of the whole or any part of the
premises by the tenant. Whether it is a voluntary act of the tenant or otherwise and also the reasons
for doing so are wholly irrelevant and can have no bearing. This view finds support from an earlier
decision rendered in Parasram Harnand Rao v. Shanti Parsad Narinder Kumar Jain, (1980) 3 SCC
565, wherein Section 14(1)(b) of the Delhi Rent Control Act came up for consideration. The tenant in
the premises was Laxmi Bank, which was ordered to be wound up and in that winding-up
proceeding, the Court appointed an official liquidator who sold the tenancy rights in favour of S.N.
Jain on 16-2-1961. The sale was confirmed by the High Court and, as a result thereof, S.N. Jain took
possession of the premises. Thereafter, the landlord filed a petition for eviction of Laxmi Bank. The
High Court held that as the transfer in favour of S.N. Jain by the official liquidator was confirmed by
the Court, he acquired the status of the tenant by operation of law and, therefore, the transfer of the
tenancy rights was an involuntary transfer and the provision of Section 14(1)(b) of the Act would not
be attracted. Reversing the judgment, this Court held that the official liquidator had merely stepped
into the shoes of Laxmi Bank which was the original tenant and even if the official liquidator had
transferred the tenancy interest to S.N. Jain under the orders of the Court, it was on behalf of the
original tenant. It was further held that the sale was a voluntary sale, which clearly was within the
mischief of the section, and assuming that the sale by the official liquidator was an involuntary sale,
it undoubtedly became an assignment as provided by Section 14(1)(b) of the Act. The Court further
held that the language of Section 14(1)
(b) is wide enough not only to include any sub-lease but even an assignment or any other mode by
which possession of the tenanted premises is parted with and the provision does not exclude even an
involuntary sale."
12.24 Reference was made to the decision of the Delhi High Court in Devinder Kumar Bajaj v. Pure
Drinks (New Delhi) Pvt. Ltd., 2001 (57) DRJ 773, wherein the court held thus:
"1. This is an application filed by the Defendant under Section 442 of the Companies
Act for the stay of proceedings. It is predicated on the fact that a winding up petition
had been admitted and citation has also been issued. The winding up petition,
however, was filed on 30th January, 1997. Even if this contention of the Defendant
was otherwise well-founded it ought to have approached the Court with expedition,
and certainly within a period of three years of the relevant event. This has not been
done and accordingly the application can be dismissed on this short point. However,
my attention has also been drawn to a decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in The
Official Liquidator v. Dharti Dhan (P) Ltd., AIR 1977 SC 740, in which it has been
observed that the passing of orders staying proceedings should not be carried out in a
mechanical manner. The Apex Court specifically enjoined that if it appears to the
Court that the application had been filed with the intention of the delaying the
proceedings, it should not be permitted.

Learned counsel has also relied on Basumati Mahajan v. Foremost Industries India Ltd., 1995 (34)
DRJ 732, where, following the previous decisions including Smt. Nirmala R. Bafna/Kershi Shivax
Cambatta and Ors. v. Khandesh Spinning & Weaving Mills Co. Ltd. and Anr./official Liquidator and
Ors., AIR 1993 SC 1380, Hon'ble Justice K. Ramamoorthy had held that Sections 442 and 446
would not be attracted where the tenancy rights of a company involved in liquidation were
concerned. He has also relied on Hansa Industries Pvt. Ltd. and Ors. v. Kidarsons Industries P. Ltd.
an Ors., 1998 III AD (Delhi) 27, to the effect that since subletting is not permissible, even in view of
the Rent Control legislation, tenancy rights would not be assets of a company which required
protection even in the currency of the winding up proceedings.
Learned counsel for the Plaintiff had submitted that where, as in the present case, no statutory
protection was available to the company viz-a-viz the tenancy, there would be no question of the
tenancy constituting an asset of the company."
12.25 Reliance was placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Shree Chamundi Mopeds Ltd.
v. Church of South India Trust Assn., (1992) 3 SCC 1, wherein, the court held thus:
"13. We are also unable to agree with the contention of the learned counsel for the
appellant-company that the leasehold interest of the appellant-company in premises leased out to it
is property for the purpose of Section 22(1). It is no doubt true that leasehold interest of the lessee in
the premises leased out to him is property which can be transferred and the said interest can also be
attached and sold by way of execution in satisfaction of a decree against a lessee. In that sense, it can
be said that the leasehold interest of a company is its property. But the question is whether the same
is true in respect of the interest of a company which is in occupation of the premises as a statutory
tenant by virtue of the protection conferred by the relevant rent law because in the instant case on
the date of reference to the Board the proceedings for eviction of the appellant-company were
pending and the appellant-company was in occupation of the premises only as a statutory tenant
governed by the provisions of the Karnataka Rent Control Act. In Gian Devi Anand v. Jeevan
Kumar, (1985) 2 SCC 683, this court has laid down that the termination of a contractual tenancy
does not bring about a change in the status and legal position of the tenant unless there are contrary
provision in the relevant Rent Act and the tenant, notwithstanding the termination of tenancy, does
enjoy an estate or interest in the tenanted premises. It is further laid down that this interest or estate
which the tenant continues to enjoy despite termination of the contractual tenancy creates a
heritable interest in the absence of any provision to the contrary. This Court has also held that the
legislature which by the Rent Act seeks to confer the benefit on the tenants and to afford protection
against eviction, is perfectly competent to make appropriate provision regulating the nature of
protection and the manner and extent of enjoyment of such tenancy rights after the termination of
contractual tenancy of the tenant including the rights and the nature of protection of the heirs on
the death of the tenant.
15. From these provisions, it would appear that except in cases covered by the two provisos to
sub-section (1) of Section 23, there is a prohibition for a tenant to sublet whole or any part of the
premises let to him or to assign or transfer in any other manner his interest therein. This prohibition
is, however, subject to a contract to the contrary. A tenant who sublets or assigns or transfers the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 34Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
premises in contravention of this prohibition loses the protection of law and can be evicted by the
landlord under Section 21(1)(f). In the case of a statutory tenant, the relationship is not governed by
contract. The prohibition against assignment and transfer is, therefore, absolute and the interest of a
statutory tenant can neither be assigned nor transferred. This means that the interest of the
statutory tenant in the premises in his occupation, as governed by the Karnataka Rent Control Act is
a limited interest which enables the surviving spouse or any son or daughter or father or mother of a
deceased tenant who had been living with the tenant in the premises as a member of the tenant's
family up to the death of the tenant and a person continuing in possession after the termination of
the tenancy in his favour, to inherit the interest of the tenant on his death. The said interest of the
tenant is, however, not assignable or transferable and, therefore, the interest of a company which is
continuing in occupation of the premises as a statutory tenant by virtue of the protection conferred
by the Karnataka Rent Control Act, cannot be regarded as property of the company for the purpose
of sub-section (1) of Section 22 of the Act and for that reason also the provisions of Section 22(1)
were not attracted to the eviction proceedings instituted by the respondents against the
appellant-company. The provisions of Section 22(1) did not, therefore, bar the prosecution of the
said proceedings by the respondents and the order dated September 30, 1989 passed by the XII
Additional Small Causes Judge, Bangalore allowing the eviction petition cannot be held to have been
passed in contravention of the provisions of Section 22(1) of the Act. Civil Appeal No. 2553 of 1991
also, therefore, fails and is liable to be dismissed.
12.26 Reliance was also placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Ravindra Ishwardas
Sethna v. Official Liquidator, (1983) 4 SCC 269, wherein, the court held thus:
"9. The Company was a tenant or a lessee of the premises of which the appellants are
the landlords. The date of the commencement of the lease is not made available to us,
but it is also not claimed on behalf of the Liquidator that there was lease of long
duration. If so, the Company was a statutory tenant under the Rent Act. The statutory
tenancy confers the right to be in possession but if the tenant does not any more
require use of the premises, the provisions of the Rent Act and especially Sections 13
and 15 completely prohibit giving the possession of the premises on licence or on
sub-lease. The learned Company Judge therefore spelt out a third way of parting with
the possession by the Liquidator, namely, that he may give the premises to the second
respondent under a caretaker's agreement. This caretaker's agreement appears to us
to be an euphemism for collecting compensation which is nothing else but the charge
for use and occupation of the premises exclusively by the second respondent.
Whether it is sub-lease or licence does not call for decision. For the purpose of the
present proceedings it is enough for us to say that the Company and its Liquidator no
more needs the premises for its own use. The Liquidator does not need the use of the
premises for carrying on the winding-up activities of the Company because he sought
direction for parting with possession. We are not impressed by the learned Judge
saying that there is some third mode of parting with possession of the premises
exclusively in favour of the second respondent, namely, caretaker's agreement which
appears to us to be a facade to wriggle out of the provisions of the Rent Act. The Rent
Act is no doubt enacted for protecting the tenants, and indisputably its provisions
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 35Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
must receive such interpretation as to advance the protection and thwart the action of
the landlord in rendering tenants destitutes. But this does not imply that the court
should lend its aid to flout the provisions of the Rent Act so as to earn money by
unfair and impermissible use of the premises. And that is what the Liquidator sought
to do and the Court extended its help to the Liquidator. This, in our opinion, is wholly
impermissible. The learned Company Judge could not have authorised the Liquidator
to enter into such an agreement and therefore his order is liable to be set aside.
10. In the appeal before the Division Bench, this aspect was not at all examined
because it is stated that this aspect was not canvassed before the Bench hearing the
appeal. The point we have examined goes to the root of the matter and, therefore, we
consider it immaterial whether the point was examined at the hearing of the appeal.
11. The learned Company Judge could not have permitted holding on to possession of
the premises, not needed for efficiently carrying on winding-up proceedings. The only
course open to him was to direct the Liquidator to surrender possession to landlords
and save recurring liability to pay rent. Before we part with this judgment, we must
take note of one submission that was made on behalf of the respondent. It was said
that the creditors and members of the Company in liquidation have suffered huge
losses and if the Liquidator would have been permitted to enter into an agreement
with the second respondent, it would fetch a steady income which would have gone
towards mitigating the hardships of the creditors and members of the Company. The
accounts of the Company in liquidation were not brought to our notice nor can we
permit violation of law howsoever laudable the object of such act may be. However,
we must record a statement made on behalf of the appellants when the
aforementioned argument was being examined by us. It was said that the second
respondent was to pay Rs 2500 per month as compensation under the directions of
the Court. That would have fetched the Liquidator an income of Rs 30,000 per year
and deducting the costs, expenses and taxes, the Liquidator may have been able to
realise at least Rs 25,000 per year. The learned counsel for the appellants submitted
that adopting a multiplier of six, assuming that roughly six years was the period for
which the agreement would have been renewed from year to year, the appellants
unconditionally offered to deposit Rs 1,50,000 in the Court to be distributed at the
discretion of this Court amongst the creditors of the Company in liquidation. We
recorded this offer in our order disposing of the appeal. We are now informed that
the amount has been deposited. The Liquidator is accordingly directed to submit the
list of the creditors of the Company with the names, addresses and claims admitted
by him within 4 weeks from today when the matter will appear again on board for
directions."
12.27 Reliance was placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Nirmala R. Bafna
(Smt) v. Khandesh Spinning and Weaving Mills Co. Ltd., (1992) 2 SCC 322, wherein, the court held
thus:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 36Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
"18. It is admitted by the official liquidator that the Board of Directors of the
company had indeed passed a special resolution affirming the agreement of sub-
tenancy in favour of the appellant. (In her plaint in Suit No. 4873 of 1984 the
appellant has referred to the said special resolution of the Board of Directors.) This
fact coupled with the statement of the learned counsel for the landlord trust
establishes, prima facie, the appellant's plea of sub-tenancy. That she was in
possession of a major portion of the said flat on the date of appointment of liquidator
is also not in dispute. According to the sub- tenancy agreement, the rent payable by
the appellant is Rs 600 per month as against Rs 900 per month payable by the
company to the landlord for the entire flat. In the above circumstances, we cannot
reject, prima facie speaking, the appellant's claim of protection of Bombay Rent
Control Act. In addition to this factual situation, there are two other circumstances
which must be taken into consideration, viz.,
(a) The tenancy rights the company had in the said flat may not be an asset for the
purpose of liquidation proceedings and
(b) merely because a company goes in to liquidation and a liquidator/official
liquidator is appointed, the rights of the company vis-à-vis its landlord and/or its
tenants do not undergo any change."
12.28 It was submitted that in the present case, in the absence of any contract to the contrary, in
view of the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 15 of the Rent Act, it is not permissible for the
Official Liquidator to sub-let, assign or transfer the interest of the company in liquidation in the
subject property, and hence, the leasehold rights/tenancy is not an asset of the company in
liquidation.
12.29 It was contended that the leasehold rights of a company in liquidation cannot be sold contrary
to provisions of the Rent Act. In support of such submission, reliance was placed upon the decision
of this Court in Kanubhai H. Prajapati v. Official Liquidator, 1999 (1) GLR 423, wherein, the court
held thus:
"14. Principles emerging as a result of above discussion can broadly be summarised
thus:
1. The rights and obligations arising under rent laws as landlord and tenant subsist
between the owner and the company in liquidation after the order of winding up is
made until the company is dissolved.
2. The leased property cannot be transferred or alienated contrary to the provisions
of the Rent laws.
3. Even where the company has closed its business and the premises are not required
for the purposes of carrying on the business, still the official liquidator is entitled to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 37Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
retain possession if it is required by him during the course of winding up for the
purpose of company's affairs, for example, keeping records, storing the stock-in-trade
and other movables or if the same are occupied by plant and machinery. Such
requirement is relevant consideration for refusing the permission to return
possession to the landlord; and
4. The leasehold tenancy rights under a lease are the assets of the company which
may be dealt with and transferred if official liquidator is required to transfer the
assets of the company as a going concern subject of course, to law permitting the
same. The transferability of the assets is a relevant consideration while deciding the
question whether the property is burdened with onerous convenants."
12.30 It was submitted that the Official Liquidator represents the company in liquidation and the
sale by him will be voluntary and even if by order of the court, it is not sale by court. It was further
submitted that the Official Liquidator is just a statutory tenant. A statutory tenant is entitled only to
possession or protection against eviction and has no right of sale, transfer or assignment of
leasehold rights. In support of such submission, the learned counsel placed reliance upon decision
of this court in Uttara Achyut Chinubhai v. O.L. of Nanikram Shobhraj Mills, 2010 (5) GLR 429,
wherein, the court held thus:
"13. The aforesaid goes to show that though the company is not the owner of the property, its status
in the property or rights in the property cannot be said as that of under the contractual monthly
tenancy but the statutory tenancy as per the provisions of the Bombay Rents Hotel and Lodging
House Rates Control Act, 1947 (hereinafter referred to as the Rent Act). The fact remains that the
company has continued to occupy the property since 1938 as the lessee under the contractual
tenancy and after the expiry of the period, it has continued to occupy the property as the tenant
under the Rent Act. The law on the aspect of, tenant in occupation of the property after the expiry of
the contractual tenancy, is well settled inasmuch as if the contractual tenancy exists, the rights of the
landlord and tenant would be governed by the contract unless expressly barred by any statute. After
the expiry of the period, if the tenant has continued to occupy the property, his status would be
protected by the statute and the terms and conditions for the rights of the landlord and tenant
would be government by the statute, which is the Rent Act in the present case.
16. So far as the rights of the landlord against the statutory tenant for recovery of the possession is
concerned, they are expressly provided under Section 13 of the Act for the various circumstances as
mentioned therein Clause (a) to (l). The pertinent aspect is that none of the circumstances except
that the company does not require the property for winding up are alleged by the applicant owner in
the present application. It also deserves to be recorded that if the owner of the property has to
recover the possession under the Rent Act, the normal remedy for such owner is to file civil suit for
recovery of the possession. However, as Official Liquidator is functioning under the supervision of
this Court as per the provisions of the Companies Act, the present application has been preferred by
the applicant owner."

12.31 Reliance was placed upon the decision of this court in Anil Pvt. Ltd. v. O.L. of G.S.T.C.,
rendered on 10.05.2002 in Company Application No. 174 of 2001, wherein, the court held thus:
"12. Mr. Soparkar in rejoinder submitted that apropos the contention raised by Mr.
Desai on behalf of the Liquidator that the applicant Company must make payment
for the purpose of vacating the premises cannot be countenanced because such
course of action was not permissible in law and the applicant was not ready to
commit any illegality. Distinguishing the Calcutta High Court Judgment in the case of
Kailash Financiers (supra) Mr. Soparkar submitted that the said judgment dealt with
the position of Tenancy Law in West Bengal and was not applicable in case of the
premises in question which would be governed by the Rent Act. That even if the
provisions under the Rent Act and the West Bengal Rent Control Law were the same,
the judgment did not lay down the correct law in light of the Supreme Court decision
in case of Ravindra Ishwardas Sethna (supra). He therefore urged that once the
Official Liquidator was prevented in law from transferring the leasehold rights there
was no question of holding on to the said rights and thus the premises in question
would be an onerous holding requiring Official Liquidator to pay rent continuously
for a property which was not required for the purpose of the business of the Company
in liquidation.
13. xxx
14. From the undisputed facts which have come on record, it is apparent that there is
no deed of lease and the Company in liquidation had occupied the premises in
question on a monthly tenancy. The nature of the tenancy therefore itself shows that
the tenancy was terminated every month subject to payment of rent. There is no
dispute that the premises in question situated at Mumbai are not of any use so far as
the Official Liquidator is concerned. The said premises are not required by the
Company for the purpose of business of the Company or for the purpose of winding
up the Company in liquidation."
12.32 Reliance was placed upon the decision of this Court in Dhairyasinh P. Rajda v. Ahmedabad
Manufacturing & Calico Ptg. Mills Co. Ltd., 2015 JX (Guj) 798, wherein, the court held thus:
"26. Thus, in view of the aforesaid decisions rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court
as well as this Court, in the facts and circumstances of the present case, when it is
revealed from the record that the applicant is the co- owner of the property in
question, a property in question was given on rent by his ancestors to M/s.
Ahmedabad Manufacturing & Calico Ptg. Mills Co. Ltd., which was thereafter taken
into liquidation by an order passed by this Court in the year 1998 and when the
reports given by the solicitors and the advocates of the Official Liquidator revealed
that the property in question does not belong to the company in liquidation, the
Official Liquidator is not having any right to retain the possession of the said
property. The applicant being co-owner of the premises in question is entitled to get
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 39Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
back the possession of the same.
27. xxx
28. Thus, the Official Liquidator is hereby directed to handover peaceful and vacant
possession of the property in question after removing the seal to the applicant and
co-owner, if any, within a period of eight weeks from the date of receipt of this order."
12.33 It was submitted that the Official Liquidator does not require the subject property for the
purpose of winding up, which is clear from the fact that he has invited offers for sale of the land in
2004. It was submitted that there is no question of selling it as a going concern as the plant and
machinery are sold and buildings are demolished. Therefore, subletting, assignment or transfer of
the subject property by Official Liquidator would be unlawful and would be an offence.
12.34 Next, it was submitted that the appellant landlord is entitled to eviction on four counts: (i) on
the count of non- payment of rent; (ii) non-user; (iii) change in user; and (iv) illegal assignment. It
was submitted that the Official Liquidator of the company in liquidation has not paid the rent since
2016. Prior thereto also, rent had not been paid for a considerable period of time despite the order
dated 23.10.2008 passed by the Division Bench in OJ Appeal No. 1 of 2003 and that, after issuance
of notice by the applicant on 02.09.2016, Rs.10,000/- was paid on 10.01.2017, after a period of more
than three months and the remaining Rs.500/- was paid subsequent thereto.
12.35 Reliance was placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Yusufbhai Noormohammed
Jodhpurwala v. Mohd. Sabir Ibrahim Byavarwala, (2015) 6 SCC 526, wherein, the court held thus:
"8. The law on Section 12(3)(b) is well settled by a series of judgments of this Court.
In Ganpat Ladha v. Sashikant Vishnu Shinde, (1978) 2 SCC 573 this Court overruled a
judgment in Kalidas Bhavan v. Bhagvandas Sakalchand case, (1958) 60 Bom LR
1359, in which a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court thought that it was open
under Section 12(3)(b) to exercise a discretion in favour of the tenant. In para 11 of
the said judgment, it was stated:
11. "It is clear to us that the Act interferes with the landlord's right to property and
freedom of contract only for the limited purpose of protecting tenants from misuse of
the landlord's power to evict them, in these days of scarcity of accommodation, by
asserting his superior rights in property or trying to exploit his position by extracting
too high rents from helpless tenants. The object was not to deprive the landlord
altogether of his rights in property which have also to be respected. Another object
was to make possible eviction of tenants who fail to carry out their obligation to pay
rent to the landlord despite opportunities given by law in that behalf. Thus, Section
12(3)(a) of the Act makes it obligatory for the Court to pass a decree when its
conditions are satisfied as was pointed out by one of us (Bhagwati, J.) in Ratilal
Balabhai Nazar v.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 40Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
Ranchhodbhai Shankerbhai Patel, AIR 1968 Guj 172. If there is statutory default or neglect on the
part of the tenant, whatever may be its cause, the landlord acquires a right under Section 12(3)(a) to
get a decree for eviction. But where the conditions of Section 12(3)(a) are not satisfied, there is a
further opportunity given to the tenant to protect himself against eviction. He can comply with the
conditions set out in Section 12(3)(b) and defeat the landlord's claim for eviction. If, however, he
does not fulfil those conditions, he cannot claim the protection of Section 12(3)(b) and in that event,
there being no other protection available to him, a decree for eviction would have to go against him.
It is difficult to see how by any judicial valour discretion exercisable in favour of the tenant can be
found in Section 12(3)(b) even where the conditions laid down by it are satisfied to be strictly
confined within the limits prescribed for their operation. We think that Chagla, C.J., was doing
nothing less than legislating in Kalidas Bhavan case in converting the provisions of Section 12(3)(b)
into a sort of discretionary jurisdiction of the court to relieve tenants from hardship. The decisions
of this Court referred to above, in any case, make the position quite clear. Section 12(3)(b) does not
create any discretionary jurisdiction in the court. It provides protection to the tenant on certain
conditions and these conditions have to be strictly observed by the tenant who seeks the benefit of
the section. If the statutory provisions do not go far enough to relieve the hardship of the tenant the
remedy lies with the legislature. It is not in the hands of courts."
This statement of the law was followed in Jamnadas Dharamdas v. J. Joseph Farreira, (1980) 3 SCC
569, at para 12 and Mranalini B. Shah v. Bapalal Mohanlal Shah, (1980) 4 SCC 251 at para 12.
9. In the judgment cited by the impugned judgment, namely, Vasant Ganesh Damle, (2002) 4 SCC
183, this Court categorically held that the right conferred upon a bona fide tenant can be availed of
only twice under the Act and not thereafter.
10. On facts, it is clear that the tenant was in arrears of rent prior to the filing of the suit and
continued to be so. On the date of the first hearing of the suit, that is the date on which issues were
struck, namely, 3-8-1994, the rent that was paid admittedly fell short by Rs 270. It is clear therefore
that assuming that the respondent is a bona fide tenant the right that is conferred upon him by the
legislature can be availed of only twice and on both occasions the tenant was found to be in arrears.
The High Court was wrong in interpreting Section 12(3)(b) purposively holding that so long as the
High Court, in its discretion, feels that there is a readiness and willingness on the part of the tenant
to pay rent, the High Court can in its discretion say that substantial compliance with Section
12(3)(b) is good enough for the tenant to escape eviction on the ground of non-payment of arrears of
rent. Having regard to the judgments of this Court and the fact that Section 12(3)(b) has been
construed to be a mandatory provision which must be strictly complied with, the judgment under
appeal has to be set aside, and the order of the Appellate Bench of Small Causes restored."
12.36 It was submitted that Jubilee Mills has closed its operations since 10.03.1987. The Official
Liquidator does not require the subject property for winding up. The sale of the subject property
would be an ex facie illegal and unlawful act and if the court approves the sale, it would be approving
something that is prohibited by law and is an offence. There is no proposal or scope of revival of the
company. The land is not required for any purpose when the winding up is going on and all the
assets have been sold and dissolution is just a matter of time. It was submitted that since the Official
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 41Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
Liquidator does not require the land for conducting liquidation of the company, the only course
open is to direct him to surrender the leasehold rights. In support of such submission, reliance was
placed on the decision of the Supreme Court in Ravindra Ishwardas Sethna v. Official Liquidator
(supra), wherein it has been held that the learned Company Judge could not have permitted holding
on to possession of the premises, not needed for efficiently carrying on winding-up proceedings. The
only course open to him was to direct the Liquidator to surrender possession to landlords and save
recurring liability to pay rent.
12.37 It was submitted that when Calico Limited transferred the leasehold rights under the 1911
agreement under the unregistered assignment deed of 1983, the same amounted to an implied
surrender of the tenancy. In support of such submission the learned counsel placed reliance upon
the decision of the Supreme Court in T. K. Latika v. Seth Karsandas Jamnadas, (1999) 6 SCC 632,
wherein, the court held thus:
"12. The principle which governs the doctrine of implied surrender of a lease is that
when a certain relationship existed between two parties in respect of a subject matter
and a new relationship has come into existence regarding the same subject matter,
the two sets cannot coexist, being inconsistent and incompatible between each other
i.e. if the latter can come into effect only on termination of the former, then it would
be deemed to have been terminated in order to enable the latter to operate. A mere
alteration or improvement or even impairment of the former relationship would not
ipso facto amount to implied surrender. It has to be ascertained on the terms of the
new relationship vis-à-vis the erstwhile demise and then judged whether there was
termination of the old jural relationship by implication."
12.38 In conclusion it was submitted that the applications therefore, deserve to be allowed in terms
of the relief prayed for therein.
13. Opposing the application, Mr. Kamal Trivedi, Senior Advocate, learned counsel with Mr. Jeet
Bhatt, learned advocate for the Official Liquidator, invited the attention of the court to the recitals
contained in the lease deed of 1911 and more particularly, the preamble and clauses 1, 3, 6 and 10
thereof. It was submitted that on a plain reading of the recitals contained in the lease deed, it is
evident that it is a lease for an indefinite period and hence, it is a permanent/perpetual lease.
13.1 It was submitted that a lease for an indefinite period is called a "Permanent/Perpetual Lease";
whereas, a lease for a definite period is called a "Fixed Term lease". If no term is fixed under the
lease, and if it contains a provision for the rights flowing therefrom being heritable, then such a
lease would be construed as permanent lease. In support of such submission, learned counsel placed
reliance upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Chapsibhai Dhanjibhai Danad v. Purushottam,
1971 (2) SCC 205, wherein, the court held thus:
"10. Looking at the document (Ex. P-4) as a whole, the lease undoubtedly is for
building a residential structure. Though it is for 30 years certain, the lessee was
entitled to remain in possession of the land so long as he paid the stipulated rent,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 42Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
which the lessor was not entitled to increase. But, though the lease is for building
structure and the period is indefinite, there are at any rate no express words
indicating that the leasehold rights thereunder were intended to be heritable. On the
other hand, it expressly provides, as was the case in Abdul Rahim's case (supra) for
the right of the lessee to remove the structures, meaning thereby vacating the land, if
he so desired. The clause providing for such removal is not that the lessee would
remove the structures on default in payment of rent, but depends on his own volition,
a clause indicative of the parties not having intended the lease to be permanent. For,
if it was intended to be permanent, there was no necessity for providing such a right.
But the argument was that there are words in the document indicative of the lease
having been intended to be heritable as was the case in Sivayogeswara Cotton Press
(supra). The mere fact, however, that a lease provided for the interests thereunder to
pass on to the heirs of the lessee would not always mean that it is a permanent lease.
Such a provision can be made in two ways resulting in two different consequences. A
lease may provide a fixed period and then include a provision that in the event of the
lessee dying before the expiry of such period, his heirs would be entitled to have the
benefit of the lease for the remainder of the period. In such a case, although the lease
may provide for the heirs to succeed to the interests in the leased land, it would only
mean that such heirs succeed to the rights upto the expiry of the lease period. If the
lease, on the other hand, were for an indefinite period, and contains a provision for
the rights thereunder being heritable, then, such a lease, though ordinarily for the
lifetime of the lessee, would be construed as permanent. The question, therefore, is to
which of these two classes of leases the present lease belongs.
xxx
14. In our view the lease before us is dearly distinguishable from that in the case of Sivayogeswara
Cotton Press (supra) where the leasehold rights were in clear terms made heritable and where the
Court held that clause (14) though placed last in the document, governed all its terms. There is no
provision in the present case comparable with such a clause. The lease was undoubtedly for an
indefinite period which only means that it was to enure for the lessee's lifetime. Reference in it of the
heirs of the lessee is only for the limited purposes set out earlier and not for making the leasehold
interests heritable. We do not find in the document words such as those in Sivayogeswara Cotton
Press (supra), which would compel us to the conclusion that the lease was intended to be
permanent."
13.2 It was submitted that if no term is fixed under the lease and if it is for building purposes (like
the clause below the chart at internal page 3 of the lease deed in question), allowing the lessee to
remain in possession so long as he pays rent, it is a permanent lease. Reliance was placed upon the
decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Sivayogeshwara Cotton Press v. M. Panchaksharappa,
AIR 1962 SC 413, wherein, the court held thus:
"10. Reliance was also placed upon the decision of the Calcutta High Court in
Promada Nath Roy v. Srigobind Chowdhry. In that case the Kabuliat did not specify
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 43Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
any period during which the lease was to subsist. It has been stipulated that the land
was to be held from year to year at an annual rent and that in the event of a masonry
building being erected on the land, rent was to be assessed at the prevailing rate.
Eventually, the tenant built the structure on the land. It was held by the Calcutta
High Court that the parties contemplated the lease to be for building purposes and
that therefore the court could presume that the lease was intended to be permanent.
The terms of the lease in that case also were not as telling as in the case before us.
xxx
12. But it was contended on behalf of the plaintiff- respondent that the term expressly
granting the lessee the right to give up possession at will was wholly inconsistent with
the permanency of the tenancy. In our opinion, the presumption raised by the fact
that the lease was for building purposes and therefore intended to be permanent is
not weakened by the fact that the lessee had stipulated with the lessor to be entitled
to give up possession if and when he decided to do so. It is a right reserved in favour
of the lessee and did not confer, as already pointed out, any corresponding right on
the lessor. Such a right in favour of the lessee cannot be converted into a disability or
an obligation which should detract from the grant of a permanent tenancy. Such a
stipulation which gives a right to the tenant to surrender the lease-hold at any time
he decided to do so, if it is coupled with a corresponding right in the landlord to serve
notice of ejectment at any time he chose to do so may have the effect of making the
tenancy, a tenancy at will, but such a conclusion has been negatived by the High
Court and rightly enough."
13.3 It was submitted that the lease does not cease to be a permanent lease, if it empowers the lessor
to re-enter the possession in the event of non-payment of rent (like clause 1 of the lease deed in
question) since such a provision is merely a security for the payment of rent. In support of such
submission, reliance was placed upon the decision of the Oudh High Court in the case of Bhagwati
Prasad and Others v. Balgobind and Others, AIR 1933 Oudh 161, wherein, the court held thus:
"4. It is not necessary to determine in the present suit whether or not the plaintiff is
an under-proprietor in the village by virtue of the lease in question. The appellants'
learned counsel contends that the plaintiff should not be treated as a member of the
village community entitled to claim the right of pre-emption, as the lease in question
contains a provision to the effect that if the lessee or his transferees or legal
representatives failed to pay the instalments of rent at the stipulated time they would
be liable to ejectment at the end of the year under Section 52 of the Oudh Bent Act. In
our opinion, this contention is not well founded, and must be overruled. The lease
under consideration does not cease to be a lease in perpetuity simply because it
contains the forfeiture clause in question. The forfeiture clause in question does not
affect the permanency of the tenure as long as the annual rent is paid. The provision
for the forfeiture of the lease for non-payment of rent was intended merely as a
security for the payment of rent. The interest in the land, which the grantor intended
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 44Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
to transfer to the lessee, was certainly heritable, transferable and perpetual. It must
be held consequently that in spite of the forfeiture clause the lease before us is a
permanent lease held at a rent fixed in perpetuity. As pointed out by a Bench of this
Court in Asghar Husain v. Sardar Husain a village community under the Oudh Laws
Act consists of the whole body of persons possessing right as proprietors,
under-proprietors or heritable lessees in village lands."
13.4 Reference was made to the decision of a Division Bench of this court in Jabal C. Lashkari v.
Official Liquidator of Prasad Mills Ltd. & Others, 2009 (1) GLR 158, wherein, the court held that the
landlord does not have any right to seek possession of the demised land except as stipulated in
clause (1) read with clause (8) of the lease deed which provided that in case the lessee fails to pay the
annual rent from year to year, the lessor shall be entitled to give a registered notice and if during the
notice period, the payment is not made, the lessor would be entitled to initiate action to claim back
possession."
13.5 Reliance was placed upon the decision of the Karnataka High Court in Sreenivas Shenoy v.
Vasudeva Shenoy, ILR 1994 Kar 1102, wherein, the court held thus:
"17. Point No. 2: Under this Point it is required to be seen as to whether the property
in question was sublet by respondents - 1 to 5 and if so, whether the same is a ground
for eviction under the Act having regard to the nature of the lease reflected in the
deed dated 18.6.1917. The learned District Judge has on fact reached a conclusion
that the lease in question is a permanent lease. It can be taken as having been
well-settled that even if a lease deed provides for a ground for eviction under the T. P.
Act, the same cannot be availed of for evicting the lessee or tenant unless the same is
also a ground for eviction under the one or the other clause of Section 21(1) of the
Act. Similarly, even if Section 21(1) of the Act provides for a ground for eviction in a
given case, the same cannot be availed of if the terms of lease between the lessor and
the lessee guarantee a fixed period of lease or a permanent lease, unless of course, the
lease deed also at the same time provides for termination of lease and recovery of
possession on the breach of conditions of any of the terms. In fact, this aspect is dealt
with by a Full Bench of this Court in SRI RAMAKRISHNA THEATRES LTD.
vs GENERAL INVESTMENTS AND COMMERCIAL CORPORATION LTD., ILR 1992
KAR 1296 In the said case, this Court, on a consideration of the various Decisions of
the Supreme Court and the earlier Decision of this Court, has held among other
things, as under.
"It is unnecessary to multiply the citations as we do not find any other Decision which
is quite relevant to the question raised before us. The meaning attributed to the
non-obstante clause in sub-section (1) of Section 21 of the Act in Bharath Petroleum
Corporation's case (AIR 1986 Kar.191 : ILR 1984 (2) Kar.401) is not correct; the
overriding effect of the said clause is limited to the subject referred to immediately by
the words following in otherwords, even if any other law or contract provides for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 45Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
recovery of possession of the same shall be of no effect and the eviction can be made
only on the grounds stated in clauses (a) to (p) of the proviso. This indicates that the
landlord should have a right to recovery possession and that right cannot be held to
vest in him during the period of the term lease unless there is something in the lease
deed which provides for the determination of the lease; in such a situation, even after
the determination of the lease in the manner stated in the term lease, the recovery of
possession will have to be made only by recourse to Section 21(1)".
We hasten to add here that this Court in the said case was concerned with the question as to whether
a landlord is entitled to seek eviction of a tenant who is holding the leasehold premises as a lessee
under a term lease, before the expiry of the period of lease when there is no provision for the
forfeiture of lease in the lease deed. However, in our view, the ratio laid down in the said case, would
mutatis mutandis apply even to a case where the lease is of a permanent nature. In the instant case,
the lease deed dated 18.6.1917 is styled as a permanent lease. However, it is also noticed that there is
a bar for alienation. In the context of the ratio laid down in the aforesaid case, it is clear that even
though there is a bar for sublease in the lease deed and the same would result in forfeiture of lease,
the same cannot be a ground for eviction under Section 21(1) of the Act. Section 2(1)(f) of the Act
reads as under:
"Protection of tenants against eviction:-
(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other law or contract,
no order or decree for the recovery of possession of any premises shall be made by
any Court or other authority in favour of the landlord against the tenant:
Provided that the Court may on an application made to it make an order for the
recovery of possession of a premises on one or more of the following grounds only,
namely:-
xxx xxx xxx
(f) that the tenant has unlawfully sublet the whole or part of the premises or assigned
or transferred in any other manner his interest therein and where the subletting,
assignment or transfer has been made before the coming into operation of this part
(except in respect of subletting, assignment or transfer to which the provisions of
Section 61 are applicable), such sub-letting, assignment or transfer has been made
contrary to any provision of law then in force."
It is necessary to state here that Section 21(1)
(f) cannot be read in isolation and the same will have to be read in conjunction with
Section 23 of the Act. Section 23 reads as under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 46Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
"Tenant not to sub-let or transfer after commencement of this part- (1)
Notwithstanding anything contained in any law, but subject to any contract to the
contrary, it shall not be lawful after the coming into operation of this part, for any
tenant to sublet whole or any part of the premises let to him or to assign or transfer in
any other manner his interest therein.
Provided that the State Government may, by notification, permit in any area the
transfer of interest in premises held under such leases or class of leases and to such
extent as may be specified in the notification:
Provided further that nothing in this section shall apply to a tenant having a right to
enjoy any premises in perpetually.
(2) Any person who contravenes the provisions of sub-section (1), shall, on
conviction, be punished with fine which may extend to one hundred rupees."
The provisions of Section 21(1)(f) and Section 23(1) of the Act will have to be understood in a correct
perspective. While Section 21(1)(f) provides that 'unlawful subletting' is a ground for eviction.
Section 23(1) stipulates as to what 'unlawful subletting' is. In the context of Section 23(1) it becomes
clear that it is not every subletting that is 'unlawful', but subletting without the consent of landlord
which is made 'unlawful'. Further the second Proviso to Section 23(1) makes it clear that para-1 of
Section 23(1) shall not apply to a tenant having a right to enjoy any premises in perpetuity. In other
words para-1 of Section 23(1) will not have any application to a permanent tenant.
xxx xxx xxx
23. Ex.P.1, as pointed out earlier, is an instrument relating to the lease in question. The same came
into being on 18.6.1917. The same clearly recites that since the lessees wanted a permanent lease, the
lessor agreeing to the same has given the properly on perpetual and permanent lease subject to the
conditions enumerated therein. Further it is noticed that the rent fixed is Rs.58-2-0 per year in cash,
50 big Malgoa mangoes of the value of Rs.3/- and 50 Raspuri mangoes. Further the deed recites that
the lessees should enjoy the property from generation to generation. It is also recited therein that if
there is any increase in the assessment of the land by the Government, the same will have to be paid
by the lessees to the lessor. Further there is also a stipulation that the lessees are not merely
personally liable to pay the enhanced assessment, rent and the interest on arrears of rent but even a
change is created on the leasehold property as also on the crops. It is also noticed that there is a
forfeiture clause with reference to the failure to pay the arrears of rent and interest thereon as also
with reference to alienation. It is also noticed that there is a right of re-entry also in the event of
forfeiture of the lease. Further, it is noticed that the rent is fixed. Then again there is a recital to the
effect that as long as lessees and their progenies go on enjoying the properties, fulfilling the
conditions adumbrated above, the lessor or his representative will not have any right either to
demand more rent or to demand the surrender of the lease. There is also a recital to the effect that
the lessees and their progencies have no rights to demand the reduction in the rate of rent.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 47Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
24. It is in the context of the aforesaid recitals that the Court is required to assess the nature of the
lease. As pointed out earlier, the main thrust of the submission of Sri Raghavendra Rao, learned
Counsel for the petitioners was on the existence of the forfeiture clause and the right of re-entry.
According to Sri Raghavendra Rao forfeiture clause coupled with the right "of re-entry destroys
permanency or perpetuity of the lease in question, notwithstanding the fact that the lease deed
describes the lease as permanent and perpetual. Sri Raghavendra Rao is right in contending that the
existence of a forfeiture clause with a right of re-entry in a lease deed is indeed a relevant factor
which will have to be taken into consideration for assessing the nature of the lease. However, as
pointed out earlier, it is not just one or two factors which should enter into the Judicial verdict. In
our view, the fact that the lease is made hereditary, the fact that the lessees themselves will have to
pay the enhanced assessment, the fact that the lessor or his representative has no right to increase
the rent, the fact that the leasehold property and the crops grown thereon are made a charge
towards the liability to pay rent and enhanced assessment and the fact that the lessor and his
representative have no right to demand the surrender of the lease as long the conditions are
fulfilled, are indeed the factors which would overwhelmingly militate against the plea that the lease
is not a permanent one. In our view, in the context of these factors which can be spelt out from the
recitals of the instrument of lease itself, the mere fact that the lease deed contains a forfeiture clause
with a right of reentry in the event of non-payment of rent or alienation of the property, by itself,
will not make the lease non-permanent. It is not as if permanent lease cannot contain a forfeiture
clause at all. In other words, forfeiture clause with right of re-entry is not conclusive to hold that the
lease is not permanent, though the said clause is indeed one of the relevant factors which will have
to be taken into consideration while deciding the question as to whether the lease is permanent or
not. It is also relevant at this juncture to refer to certain Decisions which have a bearing on this
aspect In the Decision in BHAGWATI PRASAD AND ORS. v. BALGOBIND AND ORS, AIR 1933
Oudh 161 11. AIR 1933 Oudh 161 . Among other things, it is held as under:
"The lease under consideration does not cease to be a lease in perpetuity simply
because, it contains the forfeiture clause in question. The forfeiture clause in question
does not affect the permanency of the tenure as long as the annual rent is paid. The
provision for the forfeiture of the lease for non- payment of rent was intended merely
as security for the payment of rent."
Then again, in the Decision in R.S. RAMMOHANRAI JASWANTRAI DESAI AND ORS. v.
SOMABHAI NATHABHAI PATEL AND ORS. Their Lordships of the Bombay High Court have,
among others, held as under:
"Under the decree Bhika Parshottam became a tenant for an indefinite period. In
accordance with the above decisions, it will therefore have to be held that he was a
life tenant, unless it can be shown that the terms of the lease contained in the decree,
the surrounding circumstances and the subsequent conduct of the parties indicate
that there was an intention to grant a perpetual lease. In support of his arguments
Mr. Desai has first relied on the fact that the word "defendant"
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 48Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
is used in singular and that there are no words of inheritance and no reference to heirs or legal
representative of Bhika Parshottam in the decree. But as pointed out in KOOLDEEP NARAIN
SINGH v. THE GOVERNMENT, 14 M.I.A 247 at P. 255 : (11 Beng. L.R. 71 P.C.), the omission of
words of inheritance does not show conclusively that the lease was not hereditary. See also BABU v.
SITARAM 3 Bom.L.R. 768. Mr. Desai also relied on the provision in the decree about the rendering
of service and stated that this showed that there was no intention to create a hereditary interest in
the lease. The service to be rendered was that the tenant was to drive the landlord's cart and
bullocks on two occasions in a year. This is not service of a kind which could be rendered by Bhika
Parshottam alone. It could equally well be rendered by any other person. Consequently this
provision does not necessarily suggest that only a life estate was intended to be granted. The other
circumstances on which Mr. Desai relied is the prohibition on alienation of the leasehold rights. This
undoubtedly is a circumstance in favour of the plaintiffs. But, as pointed out in Bhabataram v.
Trailokyanath, 59 Cal. 1282 (AIR (19) 1932 Cal. 764) such a provision does not militate against the
permanent character of the tenancy. Mr. Desai also invited our attention to the form in which
receipts for rent were issued from 1923 to 1936. in each of these receipts it is stated that the land had
been taken on lease for one year. But these receipts were passed by the plaintiffs and any statement
made therein would not, therefore, bind the defendants. Also, as I have mentioned above, the
plaintiff's story that Bhikha Parshottam had given up his rights under the decree and had, become
an annual tenant has not been accepted by the lower Courts. There are in this case other
circumstances which, in our opinion, clearly indicate that something much more than a lease to
enure only during the lifetime of Bhika Parshottam was intended. The suit in which the above decree
was passed was filed by the plaintiff's ancestors for recovering possession of survey No. 174 from
Bhika Parshottam, who as stated in the plaint, had been cultivating it since several years. Bhika
Parshottam then contended that he was a permanent tenant. The suit ended in a compromise
decree, and although a specific contention had been raised by the defendant Bhika Parshottam that
he was a permanent tenant, the decree is silent as to the duration of the tenancy. Bhika Parshottam
was 60 years old in 1911 when the suit was filed. His expectation of life at that time could not have
been more than a few years. The decree makes provision for a revision of the rent every 12 years.
This strongly suggests that the parties intended that the tenancy should continue even after Bhika
Parshottam's death. Another circumstance indicating a permanent grant is the provision giving the
tenant a right not only to 2/3rds share of the fruits of fruit bearing trees, but also to 2/3rds share in
the wood of ail trees. The subsequent conduct of the parties leads to the same conclusion. Bhika
Parshottam died in 1927 leaving behind two sons, Chatur and Nathabhai. The plaintiffs did not then
resume possession of the land, but allowed Chatur to continue as tenant. Chatur died in 1936-37 and
since then the present defendants have been in possession of the land. Defendant-1 is the son of
Nathabhai, while defendants-2 and 3 are the sons of Chatur. The land has, therefore, been in the
possession of Bhikha Parshottam's family for atleast three generations. The only inference that can
be drawn from these circumstances is that the lease was not intended to come to an end on Bhika
Parshottam's death, but was intended to operate as a perpetual lease, which could be terminated, as
provided in the decree, only if there was default in the payment of rent or if the rights conferred by it
were alienated.
After a careful consideration of all the circumstances, we are, therefore, of the opinion that a
hereditary interest in the lease was created by the compromise decree, which was passed in 1912,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 49Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
and that the defendants are, consequently permanent tenants in respect of 14 3/4 bighas out of
Survey No. 174."
13.6 It was submitted that a permanent lease without a forfeiture clause, creates a contractual
tenancy, which would be governed by the Transfer of Property Act and not by the Rent Act (barring
section 12 thereof) and that therefore, there cannot be eviction from such tenancy. In other words,
the period of subsisting permanent lease cannot be curtailed in the absence of a forfeiture clause. In
support of such submission, the learned counsel placed reliance upon the decision of this court in
Legal Heirs of Deceased Fakir Chand Ambaram Patel v. OL of Amruta Mills Ltd. and others, 2002
(3) GLH 367, wherein, the court held that it is settled law that the period of a subsisting lease cannot
be curtailed in absence of a forfeiture clause in the lease deed. The contractual tenancy would thus
subsist as governed by provisions of the T. P. Act and there cannot be any eviction from such
tenancy.
13.7 It was submitted that any ground contained in the lease deed other than or in addition to the
grounds enumerated in section 13(1) of the Rent Act, shall remain inoperative during subsistence of
lease, and even after expiry of lease term. Thus, when the lease deed in question is not for any fixed
term, then in that case, the ground of non-payment of rent for the purpose of re-entering the
possession, which is not prescribed in section 13 of the Rent Act, shall remain inoperative all
throughout. In support of such submission, the learned counsel placed reliance upon the decision of
a Division Bench of this court in Jabal C. Lashkari v. Official Liquidator of Prasad Mills Ltd.,
(supra), wherein, the court held that any ground contained in the agreement of lease other than or
in addition to the grounds enumerated in sub-section (1) of section 13 of the Rent Act shall remain
inoperative during subsistence of the lease and even after expiry of the lease term.
13.8 Reliance was also placed upon the decision of the Mysore High Court in Ramacharya Narayana
Charya Burli and another v. State, AIR 1965 Mysore 1, wherein, the court held thus:
"2. When R. A. No. 22 of 1959 which involves the question as to the apportionment of
compensation between the appellants representing the landlord's interest and the
respondents representing the tenant's interest was argued before a Division Bench,
the two decisions mentioned in the question referred to the Full Bench were relied
upon by Mr. V. Krishna Murthi as laying down the correct ratio of apportionment of
compensation between the landlord and the tenant and prays for a decision of the
appeal on that basis. But Mr. Jagirdar for the Respondents drew the attention of the
Bench which heard the appeal to a decision of the Privy Council in Rakhal Chandra v.
Secretary of State, AIR 1929 PC 113 and that of the Supreme Court in Vithal Yeshwant
v. Shikandarkhan, AIR 1963 SC 385 which, do not appear to accord with the
decisions of this Court. Hence the reference to a Full Bench.

6. Incidents of proprietary rights of ownership enumerated in R.A. 161 of 1955 as
requiring confederation in favour of the landlord fall into two categories. The right to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 50Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
possible contingent reversion and the right to enhance rent normally depend upon
the terms of contract of lease while the right to minerals and the right of resumption
in case the land is a service inam, depend upon the terms of the grant made by the
Government in favour of the Inamdar or the Watandar. Therefore if the landlord
claims enhanced share in the Compensation amount in respect of rights arising under
or relating to the contract of lease, be has to set up and prove what are all the special
considerations which weigh in awarding him a higher share in the compensation. In
respect of rights which are incidental to the tenure of the grant in his favour or to the
property held by him which should eater into a determination of the market-value of
the property under 23 and 24, he has to put forward his claims before the Land
Acquisition Officer and substantiate the same by proper evidence. If he fails to put
forward his rights to the mineral or other sub-soil rights before the Land Acquisition
Officer it would be unfair to allow him to make such a claim only at the time of
apportionment of compensation between himself and his tenant. He must also
establish his right to get the rent enhanced. Further his right to reversion before it
can be taken into consideration should not be so remote as to be valueless.
7. The various authorities cited at the Bar or both the parties disclose that the
valuation of a possible contingent right of reversion is a matter dependent upon the
facts and circumstances of each case, or upon the terms of contract of tenancy
between the landlord and the tenant, or the tenancy lights as may be declared by any
law in force. In Sadasheorao v. Collector Nagpur, AIR 1942 Nag 86 it was recognised
that the apportionment of compensation between the landlord and tenant has to be
made according to their several interests in the land and that "what those interests
are can only be ascertained by the evidence in each case". Vivian Bose, J. laid down
that when there is no evidence it is only possible to follow the rough and ready rule.
In stating this proposition reference was made to the decision in Shiam Lal v.
Collector of Agra, AIR 1534. All 239 (FB) which enumerated the various points in
favour of the Zamindar and of the tenant that are required to be taken into
consideration in apportioning the amount of compensation.
"The Full Bench considered the previous decisions of that High Court and the rights,
of the Zamindars in general and the occupancy rights of tenants and laid down that in
the absence of any specific evidence as to custom, practice or agreement, the fair ratio
of distribution of the compensation awarded for agricultural land as between the
Landlord on the one hand and the occupancy tenants and the other was ten annas in
a rupee to the land-Lord and six annas in a rupee to the tenants. If may be noted that
this rough and ready ratio was fixed on the basis that the incidents enumerated in the
decisions exist.
In AIR 1929 P.C. 113 the Privy Council held that the value of the landlord's chance of
receiving back the land was nothing since from the terms of the lease deed and the
Act passed by the Government the College had been put on a permanent basis and
there was no chance for the landlord to receive back the land particularly when the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 51Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
option to surrender depends upon the lessee. In Sakariyawo Oshodi v. Mariamo
Dakolo, AIR 1930 PC 261 the Privy Council held in an appeal from Nigeria, that the
land should be given 'some small portion' of compensation in respect of his
reversionary right. What the value of such right would be or how it should be
calculated, has not been indicated in that decision. In that case it appears that the
occupant had no right of alienation. If the tenancy right is both heritable and
alienable, the value of the right of reversion may be nothing.
Before the Madras High Court in Natesa Aiyar v. Kaja Maruf Sahib, AIR 1927 Mad
489 the question was one of apportionment of compensation between the
melwaramdar (landlord) and kudivaram. It held that the valuation of the former's
interest at 20 years purchase of the rent would be unfair and referred to some other
interests like the right to recover the land from the tenant and the right of forfeiture
in case of denial of title. The decision, however, proceeded on the ground that the
interest of the Kudivaramdar was merely one of occupation of the lands for
cultivation or for utilising it for the purpose for which he had taken it on lease.
Beyond laying down that the rights of persons 'are somewhat indefinite' their
Lordships did not lay down any principle as to how and when the possible right of
recovery of the land could be valued in apportioning the compensation.
The Kerala High Court, in Krishna Menon v. Raman Unni, AIR 1961 Ker 140 (FB)
considered the question of apportionment with special reference to Malabar Tenancy
Act and laid down that in the context of the Tenancy Act the possibility of the
landlord recovering possession should not be ignored. The Bombay High Court also
considered the question of reversionary right in Dossibaj's case 60 Bom LR 1208
referred to above and observed that
-
"In assessing the value of the reversion, the court cannot consider it as a
mathematical problem but must take a broad and practical view and that valuation
should be fixed by considering what the owner might obtain if the land were sold
subject to the claims of the permanent tenant whose lease was to last for 198 years".
It would thus be obvious from these decisions that the right of reversion cannot be taken into
consideration as a hypothetical consideration in all cases but should be taken into account where the
terms of the lease disclose reasonable possibility of the landlord getting back the land.
21. Hence the arguments before this full Bench have been devoted to the questions - (i) whether in
cases of permanent tenancy with no right to the landlord to enhance the rent the landlord is entitled
to anything more than the capitalised value of the rent reserved by the lease out of the compensation
awarded for compulsory acquisition of the land subject to the tenancy, and (2) whether and if so
which of the considerations adverted to or relied upon in the judgments of this Court in R.A. 161 of
1955 and R.A. 34 of 1955 can be said to be irrelevant.

xxx
26. Taking up the first of the propositions, viz. whether in the case of a permanent tenancy with no
right to the landlord to enhance the rent the landlord is entitled only to a capitalised value of the
rent calculated on a just and reasonable formula, it is obvious that the said proposition should be
correct only on the basis that the one and only right which belongs to the landlord is the right to
receive rent at a certain fixed and invariable rate. Unless it is clearly established that such is the only
right of the landlord in the circumstances of the case, either on the basis of agreement i.e. a the
terms of the lease, or on the basis of any custom, i.e., any incident or incidents annexed to contracts
by local custom, or on the basis of any statutory law regulating the mutual rights of landlords and
tenants or controlling their separate rights, as for example, a law relating to treasure-trove or a law
declaring the rights of the Government to minerals or controlling the rights of individual owners in
the matter of exploitation of minerals, the clear legal inference would be that an owner of the land
retains-to himself all rights in respect of the land other than those which he has transferred under
the lease to his tenant.
It is no doubt true that the right to receive rent is the most important right in terms of monetary
advantage. But other advantages of ownership which in conceivable circumstances may take the
shape of or result in actual monetary benefit to an owner cannot in ordinary circumstances be
wholly discounted. The very legal conception of a lease is a transfer or right to enjoy the property in
consideration of money, share of crops, service or any other thing of value to be rendered
periodically, - such return for the enjoyment being called rent. In the absence of a contract or local
custom to the contrary, the enjoyment of the property by the lessee is limited to the purpose of the
lease and he cannot use the property for a purpose other than that for which it was leased or fell or
self timber or work mines or quarries not open when the lease was granted or do any act which is
destructive or permanently injurious to the property. It means therefore that ordinarily the right to
enjoy the property transferred to the lessee under a lease is not in the contemplation of law
necessarily exhaustive of all the rights of the lessor in the property.
Consequently, the rent which is the return made by the lessee for the right of enjoyment transferred
to him cannot represent the value of the enjoyment of all the rights of the lessor in the land. In other
words, capitalised value of rent cannot be equated to the value of all rights of the lessor. To hold
otherwise would mean that a permanent lease with a fixed rent is in no respect different from an
actual sale of the land the sale price being treated as a permanent loan by the lessor to the lessee but
irrecoverable at the instance of the lessee subject only to a permanent liability of the lessee to pay a
permanently fixed amount by way of interest."
It was submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the present case since the rights of the
parties are governed by a permanent/perpetual lease, the provisions of the Rent Act would not
apply.
13.9 It was submitted that section 13 of the Rent Act provides that notwithstanding anything
contained in the Act, but subject to the provisions of section 15, a landlord is entitled to recover
possession of any premises, if the court is satisfied regarding any of the contingencies enumerated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 53Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
therein. It was submitted that section 13 of the Rent Act, therefore, is subject to the provisions of
section 15 thereof, which in turn is subject to any contract to the contrary. It was submitted that the
lease deed of 1911 creates a permanent and contractual tenancy and hence, Jubilee Mills is a
contractual tenant and not a statutory tenant.
13.10 Insofar as the lease deed of 1983 between Calico Limited and Jubilee Mills not being a
registered agreement is concerned, the learned counsel placed reliance upon the provisions of
section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act. It was submitted that section 53A of the Transfer of
Property Act envisages the doctrine of part performance. It was submitted that Ahmedabad
Manufacturing has transferred its leasehold rights in the subject property to Calico Limited, who is
turn has transferred its leasehold rights to Gaurav Chemtex/Jubilee Mills under the agreement of
1983. It was submitted that Jubilee Mills Ltd. had performed its part of contract under the
agreement of 1983, and hence, the doctrine of part performance would be attracted in the present
case. Therefore, considering the fact that the agreement of 1983 is not a registered document,
Jubilee Mills may not be in a position to file a suit based on the agreement, it can certainly rely upon
the document in its defence under the proviso to section 49 of the Registration Act. It was
contended that section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act enables Jubilee Mills to use the deed of
1983 as a shield to protect its possession, though it may not be able to claim title on that basis.
Therefore, non-registration of the agreement of 1983 will not give rise to any right in favour of the
original lessor to take possession from Jubilee Mills.
13.11 As regards the contention that the Official Liquidator cannot sell the leasehold rights, the
learned counsel submitted that the provisions of the Rent Act have to be interpreted harmoniously.
It was pointed out that section 19 of the Rent Act makes an exception in the case of the proviso to
section 15(1) thereof which permits sub-letting in case where the State Government, by notification
in the Official Gazette, permits in any area the transfer of interest in premises held under such leases
or class of leases and to such extent as may be specified in the notification. It was submitted that
since the State Government has issued notification under section 15(1) of the Rent Act, it is lawful
for the Official Liquidator to sell the leasehold rights.
13.12 Referring to the lease deed of 1911, the learned counsel submitted that the lease does not refer
to any specific period and says that till the lessee continues to pay the rent, there is no question of
possession. It was submitted that under the clauses of the lease deed, option is given to the lessee to
surrender the lease if he so desires but no option has been given to the lessor. Moreover, there are
no specific clauses in the lease deed dealing with forfeiture of the lease. It was urged that reading the
clauses harmoniously, it is evident that the nature of the lease is permanent/perpetual. In support of
such submission, the learned counsel placed reliance upon the decision of the Calcutta High Court
in A. Caspersz v. Kader Nath Sarbadhikari and Others, (1901) 28 ILR 738 (Cal), wherein, the court
held that the fact that the landlord had permitted a pucca house to be built upon the land by the
tenant, which house has stood for a very considerable time, raises a presumption that the original
grant was some kind of permanent building grant. It was submitted that the lease deed of 1911
permits the lessee to construct buildings on the subject property; therefore, the presumption is that
it is a permanent lease.

13.13 Reliance was also placed upon the decision of the Privy Council in Mt. Afzal un. Nissa v. Abdul
Karim and Others, AIR 1919 Privy Council 11, wherein, reliance was placed upon the above-referred
decision of the Calcutta High Court in A. Caspersz v. Kader Nath Sabbadhikari (supra). Strong
reliance was placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Sivayogeshwara Cotton Press v. M.
Panchaksharappa, AIR 1962 SC 413, wherein the court held thus:
"8. Addressing ourselves to that question, it is clear on a construction of the
document Ex-I that it was a lease of the demised premises for a term of 20 years
certain, on payment of Rs 350 annual rent in advance, even though the lessee may
not continue to occupy the demised land; that the lessee had been granted a right to
continue the lease of the demised premises as long as the lessee desired to do so; that
on his choosing to continue to enjoy the leasehold, the lessee was obliged to pay
annually the enhanced rent of Rs 400 for the next ten years after October 1, 1934, and
after the expiration of the ten years aforesaid, the rent was further enhanced to the
sum of Rs 500 per annum; that the lessee was given the option to give up the lease at
any time after October 1, 1934, without any further liability for payment of the
stipulated rent; that (and this is a very important stipulation) the lessor bound
himself not to call upon the lessee at any time to give up possession of the lease-hold
as long as the lessee was prepared to observe the terms of the lease; that the lessee
was fully authorised "to erect, as many buildings, godowns, factories, bungalows and
other structures etc." as also to pull down and re-erect structures or to make any
alterations, as desired by him; that the lessor undertook not to raise any objection to
the lessee making those structures or his using or enjoying the land in any way or for
any purposes according to his desire; that the lessor undertook to pay the annual
assessment to the Government in respect of the demised premises but the lessee was
obliged to pay all fines and other taxes which the Government might impose for
granting permission to convert the culturable land into land meant for building
factories and other structures as contemplated between the parties that if the lessee
chose to give up possession of the demised premises, he shall be entitled to take away
all machinery, iron and steel, woodworks etc. of the factories, buildings and other
structures that may be standing; that in the event of a default in the payment of the
annual rent fixed as aforesaid, upon notice of demand served upon the lessee, the
lessor reserved the right to retake possession of the demised land. The lessee was also
declared by para 10 quoted above to be always entitled to sublet or relet the
demised/land to any person and on any terms. As the lease was apparently for the
purpose of converting agricultural land into factory premises necessary for running
the factory, it was specifically provided that if the Government refused to give the
necessary permission for setting up the factory, the lease shall he deemed to be
cancelled Para 13 also contains a stipulation that the heirs and assigns of the lessor
shall have no right to disturb the lessee in peaceful possession of the demised
premises, and that in the event of any such interference, the lessee shall be entitled to
claim damages for the loss suffered by any action on the part of the lessor or his heirs
or successors. Para 14 is also a very important clause in the lease deed, which though
coming as the last clause, must govern all the stipulations between the parties. Thus
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 55Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
the terms and conditions of the lease which created the rights and obligations
between the lessor and the lessee were specifically declared to be binding on the heirs
and successors-in-interest of the lessor and the lessee.
9. It is manifest, therefore, on a plain construction of the terms aforesaid of the lease
deed that the purpose of the transaction was a building lease that though there was
liberty reserved for the lessee or his successor to give up the lease-hold at any time
after October 1, 1934, no corresponding right was reserved to the lessor. Thus there is
no room for the controversy which has occupied a large portion of the judgments of
the courts below, that reservation of the right to the lessee to surrender possession at
any time, imported a corresponding right to the lessor to call upon the lessee to give
up possession. It was an advantage specifically reserved to the lessee without any
corresponding benefit to the lessor. It is equally clear that the lease was heritable and
assignable. Thus there is no difficulty in holding that there is no room for the
contention, on the terms of the lease, that the parties intended that after the lapse of
the first 20 years of the lease, the tenancy will be merely a tenancy at will. It was
clearly a tenancy for an indefinite period, at the least.
10. The contention on behalf of the appellant is that on a proper construction of the
lease deed, read as a whole, the inference is clear that the parties intended it to be a
permanent lease. The first argument in support of the conclusion we are asked to
arrive at is that it is clearly a lease for building purposes; and it is rightly pointed out
that where the land is let out for building purposes without a fixed period, the
presumption is that it was intended to create a permanent tenancy. Reliance was
placed upon the leading case in Navalram Shankardas v. Javerilal Govandram, 7 Bom
LR 401, where Sir Lawrence Jenkins, C.J., laid it down that a presumption in favour
of a permanent tenancy arises on a transaction like the one we have before us. The
terms of the grant in that case are set out in full at p. 402 and it is clear on a reference
to those terms that the deed was not as strong as we have in the instant case. Only
two things were explicit in the terms of that document, namely, (1) that it was a lease
for building purposes and (2) that as long as the lessee continued to pay the
stipulated rent, the lessor would not be entitled to call upon the lessee to quit.
11. Reliance was also placed upon the decision of the Calcutta High Court in Promada
Nath Roy v. Srigobind Chowdhry, ILR 32 Cal 648. In that case the Kabuliat did not
specify any period during which the lease was to subsist. It has been stipulated that
the land was to be held from year to year at an annual rent and that in the event of a
masonry building being erected on the land, rent was to be assessed at the prevailing
rate. Eventually, the tenant built the structure on the land. It was held by the Calcutta
High Court that the parties contemplated the lease to be for building purposes and
that therefore the court could presume that the lease was intended to be permanent.
The terms of the lease in that case also were not as telling as in the case before us.

12. Similar was the case of Forbes v. Hanuman Bhagat, ILR 2 Pat 452, decided by a
Division Bench of the Patna High Court which applied the decision of the Calcutta
High Court in Promada Nath Roy v. Srigobind Chowdhry, ILR 32 Cal 648, to the case
before it. That case was followed by a subsequent Division Bench in the case of CIT v.
Maharajadhiraj Kumar Visheshwar Singh, AIR 1940 Pat 24. Fazl Ali, J., who
delivered the leading judgment of the court relied upon the decision of their
Lordships of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Raja Janki
Nath Boy v. Dina Nath Kundu, since deceased, AIR 1931 PC 207. Mr Justice Fazl Ali
particularly relied upon two circumstances which in his view supported the inference
of the tenancy being permanent, namely, (1) that no term had been fixed in the lease
and (2) that the lease deed contained provisions for the exercise of certain rights by
the heirs of the lessor and the lessee, apart from the circumstance that the building
was for enabling the lessee to build a gola (ware-house) and a platform for a rice mill.
In all these cases decided by the Bombay, Calcutta and Patna High Courts as also by
the Judicial Committee, there was no fixed period as the term of the lease.
13. But it was contended on behalf of the plaintiff- respondent that the term expressly
granting the lessee the right to give up possession at will was wholly inconsistent with
the permanency of the tenancy. In our opinion, the presumption raised by the fact
that the lease was for building purposes and therefore intended to be permanent is
not weakened by the fact that the lessee had stipulated with the lessor to be entitled
to give up possession if and when he decided to do so. It is a right reserved in favour
of the lessee and did not confer, as already pointed out, any corresponding right on
the lessor. Such a right in favour of the lessee cannot be converted into a disability or
an obligation which should detract from the grant of a permanent tenancy. Such a
stipulation which gives a right to the tenant to surrender the lease- hold at any time
he decided to do so, if it is coupled with a corresponding right in the landlord to serve
notice of ejectment at any time he chose to do so may have the effect of making the
tenancy, a tenancy at will, but such a conclusion has been negatived by the High
Court and rightly enough."
13.14 Reference was made to the decision of the Supreme Court in Modern Hotel v. K.
Radhakrishnaiah, (1989) 2 SCC 686, wherein the court held thus:
"4. Two contentions have been advanced by Mr P.P. Rao appearing for the appellant
to maintain that the order of eviction was contrary to law and cannot be sustained.
Reliance is placed on Section 7 of the Andhra Pradesh Buildings (Lease, Rent and
Eviction) Control Act, 1960, (hereinafter "Act") in support of the stand that the sum
of Rs 5000 which lay as advance in the hands of the respondent landlord was either
refundable to the tenant or adjustable against rent and if out of the sum of Rs 5000
the arrears were available to be adjusted, the tenant was not at all in default. It has
next been contended that the lease of 1969 was for a term of 30 years certain and
eviction has been claimed against a contractual tenant during the subsistence of the
lease. Admittedly, the lease does not have a forfeiture clause so as to bring the matter
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 57Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
within the ambit of Section 111(g) of the Transfer of Property Act. The application for
eviction, a copy of which is available on the record (at p. 10 of the second paper
book), refers to a notice in para 7 in the following terms:
"The petitioners caused a registered notice through their counsel dated 28-10-1973 to
the respondent demanding the rent due and also for the eviction from the schedule
mentioned premises since the respondent has become a wilful defaulter. The
respondent received the notice and has not chosen to give any reply."
It, therefore, follows, appellant's counsel has contended, that the lease remained unterminated and
the right created under the lease cannot be taken away by filing an application for eviction on the
plea of wilful default in the matter of payment of rent."
"11. The second contention advanced before us is equally weighty. The lease being for
a term of 30 years is to expire in September 1999. As we have already said, the lease
did not stipulate a forfeiture clause and in the absence of a forfeiture clause in the
lease leading to termination by forfeiture, the contractual tenancy was subsisting
under the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act and there could not be any
eviction from such a tenancy."
It was submitted that the present case, factually fits in the four corners of this judgment.
13.15 Reliance was placed upon the decision of the Patna High Court in A. H. Forbes v. Hanuman
Bhagat and Others, AIR 1924 Pat 88, wherein, the court held thus:
"4. Two questions were agitated in the Court below, namely:-
(1) Whether the lease in favour of the defendants was a permanent lease in its
inception, and (2) Whether the subsequent acts and conduct of the lessor and the
lessees converted the lease into a permanent one and if so, whether the plaintiff
lessor is therefore estopped from bringing a suit for khas possession of the land in
suit. The Court below has decided both to issues against the plaintiff. Mr. Sen on
behalf of the appellant impugns the finding of the Court below on both the issues.
Now the plaintiff's suit will fall if any of the aforesaid issues is decided against him.
The first issue depends upon the construction of the document in question. It is
conceded that no definite term was fixed in the lease. That in itself will not show
either that the lease was of a permanent character or that it was for a term of year. As
to whether this indefinite term was intended to be perpetual or permanent depends
upon the intention of the parties as gathered from the covenants in the lease. The
learned Subordinate Judge has in his judgement summarised the terms. It is not
necessary to refer to all of them for the purposes of this appeal. We may, however,
refer to the following terms only:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 58Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
(1) The purpose of the lease was to enable the lessee to erect Gola house and to
purchase and sell all sorts of commodities therein, or in other words to open his
business therein;
(2) The lease was not limited for any definite period but that it was a bemaiyadi lease
or a lease without any term;
(3) ... That the lessee shall not have the power to construct any pucca building
without the express and written permission of the lessor and if that stipulation be
violated and pucca building be raised by the lessee without such permission of the
lessor, he, the lessee shall be liable to be evicted; and (4) ... In case the lessee wants to
erect pucca building and to have a pucca well or Indara he shall have to do so
according to the advice of the lessor.
5. Now it is clear from the aforesaid terms that the lease was for the purpose of gola business and for
building houses. It is also clear that the erection of pucca buildings for the business as well as for the
purpose of residence was in the contemplation of the parties with the condition that permission for
erecting pucca structures will have to be taken from the lessor. Under these circumstances, the
inference is not unreasonable that the lease in question was meant to be of a permanent character
and not from year to year. No doubt, as observed, a bemaiyadi lease or a lease without any term may
in the circumstances of a particular case be shown not to confer any permanent grant as was held in
the cases relied upon by the learned counsel on behalf of the appellant: Baroda Prasad v. Prasanna
Kumar; Mahim Chandra v. Anil Bandhu, Parshen Kuer v. Tulsi Kuer, and Kailaspati Choddhury v.
Muneshar Choudhury. The decisions in those case were applicable to the particular facts decided
and the leases concerned. The present case is very near the case reported as Promoda Nath Roy v.
Sri Govind Choudhury. Upon the facts in the present case and the lease in question we are not
prepared to differ from the view of the Court that at its inception the lease was a permanent lease,
and not one from year to year."
13.16 It was submitted that considering the principles laid down in the above decisions, it is evident
that the lease of 1911 is a permanent lease and not a lease from year to year. It was submitted that
for the purpose of considering whether the parties would be governed by the Rent Act or the
covenants of the contract between the parties, the character of relationship between the lessor and
lessee has to be seen. It was submitted that the provisions of the Rent Act will be excluded because
there is a contract to the contrary between the parties, and, therefore, the tenancy in question is a
contractual and not a statutory one.
13.17 Reliance was also placed upon the decision of a Full Bench of the Karnataka High Court in Sri
Ramkrishna Theatres Ltd. v. General Investments and Commercial Corporation Ltd. and Others,
AIR 1993 Karnataka 90, wherein, the court held thus:
"19. Again, coming to the Gian Devi's case, the following observations made at page
812 are to be noted:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 59Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
".... These decisions correctly lay down that the termination of the contractual
tenancy by the landlord does not bring about a change in the status of the tenant who
continues to remain in possession after the termination of the tenancy by virtue of
the provisions of the Rent Act. A proper interpretation of the definition of tenant in
the light of the provisions made in the Rent Acts makes it clear that the tenant
continues to enjoy an estate or interest in the tenanted premises despite the
termination of the contractual tenancy.
Accordingly, we hold that if the Rent Act in question defines a tenant in substance to
mean a tenant who continues to remain in possession even after the termination of
the contractual tenancy till a decree for eviction against him is passed, the tenant
even after the determination of the tenancy continues to have an estate or interest in
the tenanted premises and the tenancy rights both in respect of residential premises
and commercial premises are heritable. The heirs of the deceased tenant in the
absence of any provision in the Rent Act to the contrary will step into the position of
the deceased tenant and all the rights and obligations of the deceased tenant
including the protection afforded to the deceased tenant under the Act will devolve
on the heirs of the deceased tenant."
The tenant's estate or interest in the tenanted premises is a valuable right and, if so, such an estate
or interest cannot be defeated by interpreting the Act in a particular manner when the words used in
the Act specifically do not provide for the taking away of the estate or interest vested in the tenant.
One more decision which is very relevant is the one reported in Modern Hotel, Gudur v. K.
Radhakrishnaiah, AIR 1989 SC 1510. The tenant therein was a term lessee. An action for eviction
was initiated against the tenant in the plea that the tenant had failed to pay the rent for a certain
period. There was an order of eviction which was affirmed by the Supreme Court. The Supreme
Court held that the action was not maintainable because:
"......It has next been contended that the lease of 1969 was for a term of 30 years
certain and eviction has been claimed against a contractual tenant during the
subsistence of the lease. Admittedly, the lease does not have a forfeiture clause so as
to bring the matter within the ambit of S. 111(g) of the Transfer of Property Act. The
application for eviction, a copy of which is available on the record (at p. 10 of the
second paper book), refers to a notice in paragraph 7 in the following terms:
"The petitioners caused a registered notice through their counsel dated 28-10-1973 to
the respondent demanding the rent due and also for the eviction from the schedule
mentioned premises since the respondent has become a wilful defaulter. The
respondent received the notice and has not chosen to give any reply".
It, therefore, follows, appellant's counsel has contended, that the lease remained unterminated and
the right created under the lease cannot be taken away by filing an application for eviction on the
plea of wilful default in the matter of payment of rent."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 60Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
This contention was accepted by the Supreme Court at page 1513, thus:
"......The lease being for a term of 30 years to expire in Sept., 1999. As we have
already said, the lease did not stipulate a forfeiture clause in the lease leading to
terminating by forfeiture, the contractual tenancy was subsisting under the
provisions of the Transfer of Property Act and there could not be any eviction from
such a tenancy."
20. From the above it is clear that while the contractual tenancy subsists, the Rent Control Act
cannot be applied to evict the tenant. The observation of the Supreme Court is not based on any
particular provision of the relevant Andhra Pradesh Rent Control Act but is based on the principles
flowing out of the provisions of the T. P. Act and the interest created in the tenant under a term
lease. Mr. A. G. Holla, learned Counsel for the petitioner, however, very fairly brought to our notice
that term leases were excluded from the ambit of the Andhra Pradesh Act. But the learned Counsel
also rightly contended that the decision of the Supreme Court is not based on any such provision
because such provision was not noticed in the decision of the Supreme Court as a ground for the
above observation.
21. It is unnecessary to multiply the citations as we do not find any other decision which is quite
relevant to the question raised before us. The meaning attributed to the non obstante clause in
Sub-Section (1) of Section 21 of the Act in Bharath Petroleum Corporation's case is not correct; the
overriding effect of the clause in Sub-Section (1) of S. 21 of the Act is limited to the subject referred
to immediately by the words following. In other words, even if any other law or contract provides for
recovery of possession the same shall be of no effect and the eviction can be made only on the
grounds stated in clauses (a) to
(p) of the proviso. This indicates that the landlord should have a right to recover possession and that
right cannot be held to vest in him during the period of the term lease unless there is something in
the lease deed which provides for the determination of the lease; in such a situation, even after the
determination of the lease in the manner stated in the term lease, the recovery of possession will
have to be made only by recourse to Section 21(1). "
13.18 Reliance was placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Laxmidas
Bapudas Darbar v. Rudravva, (2001) 7 SCC 409, wherein, the court held thus:
"15. It has nowhere been held that by virtue of the provisions of the Rent Act the
contract of term lease is completely obliterated in all respects. The effect of the Rent
Act on tenancy under contract has been considered only to a limited extent, confining
it to the necessity of giving notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act.
16. Next we may consider the decision in the case of Shri Lakshmi Venkateshwara
Enterprises. It was a case relating to a term lease of 32 years. In para 5 it has been
observed as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 61Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
"5. This court in V. Dhanapal Chettiar v. Yesodai Ammal, (1979) 4 SCC 214,
categorically laid down that contractual tenancy will lose its significance in view of
the Rent Control Act. In that case, even the notice under Section 106 of the Transfer
of Property Act was held to be a surplusage. It is, therefore, urged that if a landlord
could found an action on any one of the enumerated grounds under Section 21 of the
Act, the action would be maintainable notwithstanding the existence of a contractual
lease."
The above observations have been made by referring the decision in Dhanapal Chettiar case without
taking into account the context in which Chettiar case was decided. The Court then proceeds to
consider Section 21 of the Act which reads as under:
"21. Protection of tenants against eviction.-- Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in any other law or contract, no order or decree for the recovery of
possession of any premises shall be made by any court or other authority in favour of
the landlord against the tenant:
Provided that the court may on an application made to it, make an order for the
recovery of possession of a premises on one or more of the following grounds only,
namely--
* * *"
(emphasis supplied)
On the basis of the above provision it has been observed that anything contained to
the contrary, in any contract cannot prevail.
17. It may have to be scrutinized as to what extent the provisions of Section 21 of the
Karnataka Rent Act shall have an overriding effect over any other law or a contract.
The Rent Acts have primarily been made, if not wholly, to protect the interest of tenants, to restrict
charging of excessive rent and their rampant eviction at will. In that view of the matter, Section 21 of
the Karnataka Rent Act provides that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any
contract, no order for eviction of a tenant shall be made by the court or any other authority.
Undoubtedly, it is a provision providing statutory protection to the tenants as it is also evident from
the heading of Section 21 of the Act. This prohibition is however relaxed under the proviso saying
that an order for recovery of possession of the premises can be made on an application made on that
behalf only on the grounds as enumerated in clauses (a) to (p) to the proviso. The non obstante
clause contained under Section 21 of the Act, will override any condition in any contract which may
provide a ground for eviction other than those enumerated in clauses (a) to (p) of sub-section (1) of
Section 21. Such an additional ground in a contract shall be rendered ineffective. The use of the
word "only" in the proviso is significant to emphasise that it relates to grounds alone which cannot
be added over and above as provided. The whole contract or other conditions not related to eviction
or grounds of eviction shall not be affected. So far as a fixed-term lease is concerned, it shall be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 62Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
affected only to the extent that even after expiry of period of the lease the possession cannot be
obtained by the lessor unless one or more of the grounds contained in Section 21 of the Act are
available for eviction of the tenant. There is nothing to indicate nor has it been held in any case that
in view of Section 21 of the Karnataka Rent Act a contract of fixed- term tenancy stands obliterated
in totality. As indicated in the earlier part of this judgment in the case of Dhanapal Chettiar it has
been observed in para 5 that none of the State Rent Acts have abrogated or affected the provisions of
Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act which provides for lease of immovable property from
year to year or for a term more than a year or reserving a yearly rent. As indicated earlier, the
proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 21 of the Karnataka Rent Act limits the grounds on which a
landlord can seek eviction of a tenant. Nothing has been indicated by reasons of which it can be
concluded that a contract of tenancy loses significance on coming into force of the Karnataka Rent
Act. The effect of the non obstante clause, in our view has been rightly explained in the Full Bench
decision in the cases of Sri Ramakrishna Theatres Ltd. v. General Investments and Commercial
Corpn. Ltd, AIR 1993 Kant 90. In one of the decisions of this Court reported in Modern Hotel v. K.
Radhakrishnaiah, (1989) 2 SCC 686, it has been held that period of a subsisting lease for fixed term
could not be curtailed in the absence of a forfeiture clause in the lease.
18. The effect of the non obstante clause contained under Section 21 of the Karnataka Rent Act on
the fixed- term contractual lease may be explained as follows:
(i) On expiry of period of the fixed-term lease, the tenant would be liable for eviction
only on the grounds as enumerated in clauses (a) to (p) of sub-
section (1) of Section 21 of the Act.
(ii) Any ground contained in the agreement of lease other than or in addition to the grounds
enumerated in clauses (a) to (p) of sub-section (1) of Section 21 of the Act shall remain inoperative.
(iii) Proceedings for eviction of a tenant under a fixed- term contractual lease can be initiated during
subsistence or currency of the lease only on a ground as may be enumerated in clauses (a) to (p) of
sub- section (1) of Section 21 of the Act and it is also provided as one of the grounds for forfeiture of
the lease rights in the lease deed, not otherwise.
(iv) The period of fixed-term lease is ensured and remains protected except in the cases indicated in
the preceding paragraph.
19. With great respect therefore, in our view, the decision in the case of Dhanapal Chettiar has not
been correctly construed in the case of Shri Lakshmi Venkateshwara Enterprises (P) Ltd., (1994) 2
SCC 671, and it no more holds good nor the Full Bench decision following it, in the case of Bombay
Tyres International Ltd, AIR 1997 Kant 311. The earlier judgment of the Full Bench of the High
Court in the case of Sri Ramakrishna Theatres Ltd. lays down the law correctly."
13.19 Reliance was placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Jabal C. Lashkari v. Official
Liquidator, (2016) 12 SCC 44, wherein, the court held thus:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 63Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
"18. Section 12 of the Rent Act confers protection on a tenant who is regularly paying
or is ready and willing to pay the rent. In the present case while there is no doubt that
rent has not been paid, equally, there is no doubt that the secured creditors including
State Bank of India had all along been ready and willing to pay the rent and the
reason for non-payment appears to be (para 43 of the impugned order of the High
Court) lack of communication by the Official Liquidator to SBI of the precise amount
of rent due. While there can be no doubt that mere readiness and willingness to pay
without actual payment cannot enure to the benefit of the tenant in perpetuity what
is required under sub-section (2) of Section 12 is a notice in writing by the landlord
raising a demand of rent and only on the failure of the tenant to comply with such
notice within a period of one month that the filing of a suit for recovery of possession
is contemplated. The service of notice giving an opportunity to the tenant to pay the
unpaid rent is the first chance/opportunity that the Rent Act contemplates as a legal
necessity incumbent on the landlord to afford to the tenant. Admittedly, in the
present case, no such notice as contemplated by Section 13(2) has been issued by the
landlord; at least none has been brought to our notice. In such a situation, the
readiness and willingness of the tenant to pay the rent, though may have continued
for a fairly long time without actual payment, will not deprive the tenant of the
protection under the Rent Act. Though the order of the High Court in para 43 of the
impugned judgment has been placed before the Court as an order under Section
12(3)(b) of the Rent Act, we do not find the said order to be of the kind contemplated
by Section 12(3)(b) inasmuch as not only the order does not mention any specific rent
which has to be tendered in court but what is encompassed therein is a direction to
the Official Liquidator to let State Bank of India know the precise amount that is
required to be paid on account of rent and, thereafter, to pay the same to the Official
Liquidator whereafter it has been left open for the lessors to withdraw the said
amount from the Official Liquidator. Such an order by no stretch of reasoning would
be one contemplated under Section 12(3)(b). In the aforesaid situation, the finding of
the High Court that the landlord is not entitled to seek eviction on the ground of
non-payment of rent under Section 12 of the Bombay Rent Act cannot be said to be so
inherently infirm so as to require the interference of this Court.
19. This will bring the Court to a consideration of the liability of the Official
Liquidator to a decree of eviction on the ground contemplated under Section 13(1)(e)
of the Bombay Rent Act. As already discussed in a preceding paragraph of the present
order, the non obstante clause of Section 13(1) overrides only the other provisions of
the Bombay Rent Act and is also subject to the provisions of Section 15. Section 15
which deals with sub-letting and transfer, though overrides the provisions contained
in any other law, is subject to any contract to the contrary. Though in the present case
the lease deed (Clause 7) is capable of being read as permitting sub-letting and not
assignment what has been held in the present case by the High Court, by virtue of the
decision of this Court in Laxmidas Bapudas Darbar v. Rudravva, (2001) 7 SCC 409, is
that in view of the limited operation of the non obstante clause in Section 15 of the
Bombay Rent Act, unlike Section 21 of the Karnataka Act, the provisions of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 64Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
Transfer of Property Act [Section 118(o)] will not become irrelevant to the
relationship between the parties in which event assignment may also be permissible
notwithstanding the specific content of Clause 7 of the lease deed in question.
However, we need not dwell on this issue at any length or would also be required to
consider the efficacy of the arguments of the learned Additional Solicitor General on
the strength of the two Privy Council decisions mentioned above i.e. Hunsraj v. Bejoy
Lal Seal, AIR 1930 PC 59, and Ram Kinkar Banerjee v. Satya Charan Srimani, AIR
1939 PC 14, inasmuch as from Company Application No. 34 of 2004, which deals
with the claim of the appellants for eviction of the Official Liquidator from the leased
property, what is clear and evident is that the case of sub-letting of the leased
premises on which basis eviction has been prayed for is not sub-letting/assignment
by the Official Liquidator but assignment of the leased premises to Prasad Mills by
the original managing agents in whose favour the initial lease was executed by the
predecessors of the present owners. The ground of unauthorised and impermissible
assignment by the Official Liquidator on the strength of the notice/advertisement for
disposal of the leased land thereby making the said authority liable for eviction is an
argument advanced only at the hearing of the appeals before us. That apart, the said
argument overlooks the fact that the assignment was only sought to be made by the
advertisement/notice issued and did not amount to a completed action on the part of
the Official Liquidator so as to attract the relevant provisions of the Bombay Rent Act
dealing with the consequential liability for eviction. Such argument also belies the
injunctive/prohibitory relief sought for in the company applications, as already
noticed, insofar as the contemplated sale/transfer/assignment of the leased property
by the Official Liquidator is concerned. The arguments advanced on the strength of
the provisions of Section 19 of the Bombay Rent Act would also stand answered on
the above basis."
13.20 It was submitted that, applying the principles enunciated in the above decision to the facts of
the present case, the applicant had issued notice on 02.09.2016 for payment of Rs.10,500/-,
whereafter, Rs.10,000/- was paid on 10.01.2017 and the remaining Rs.500/- was paid subsequent
thereto on 04.04.2017, therefore, there is substantial compliance of the requirements of section
12(2) of the Rent Act. It was submitted that there was no lack of readiness and willingness on the
part of the Official Liquidator to pay the arrears of rent. It was submitted that in respect of the
amount relating to the period 2017 to 2020, such amount has been paid on 16.03.2020 and that, in
any case for non-payment of arrears there is a requirement on the part of the lessor to issue notice
from time to time.
13.21 Reliance was placed upon the decision of the Bombay High Court in Ratanlal Chandiprasad
Jalan v. Raniram Darkhan, AIR 1986 Bom 184, wherein the court has held that a statutory tenant
would continue to possess the same rights and would be under the same obligations which were
available during the subsistence of the contractual tenancy. The question whether a statutory tenant
has a transferable interest or not would depend upon the terms of the contractual tenancy. Such
terms would continue to operate even after the contractual tenancy comes to an end and the tenant
becomes a statutory tenant. But again this would be subject to a contrary provision in the Bombay
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 65Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
Rent Act. Under section 108(j) of the Transfer of Property Act in the absence of a contract to the
contrary the lessee has a right to transfer his tenancy rights absolutely or by way of sub-lease etc.
This right would continue to exist in favour of a statutory tenant but all this would be subject to the
provisions of the Bombay Rent Act. Section 15 of the Bombay Rent Act provides that
notwithstanding anything contained in any law but subject to a contract to the contrary it shall not
be lawful for the tenant to sublet his interest. Thus, it would be necessary to read this provision and
section 108(j) of the Transfer of Property Act together. So read, it would be clear that a tenant,
under the Transfer of Property Act, can sublet his interest if there is contract to the contrary.
However, section 15 (now section 15(1)) of the Rent Act prohibits any sub-lease, assignment or
transfer by a tenant of his interest if there is no contract to the contrary; a breach thereof renders
the tenant liable to eviction under section 13(1)(c). Thus, under the Rent Act, sub-tenancy will be
permissible not when the contract is silent but when the contract specifically permits a sub-lease.
13.22 Reference was made to section 114 of the Transfer of Property Act, which provides for relief
against forfeiture for non-payment of rent and lays down that, where a lease of immovable property
has determined by forfeiture for non- payment of rent, and the lessor sues to eject the lessee, if, at
the hearing of the suit, the lessee pays or tenders to the lessor the rent in arrears, together with
interest thereon and his full costs of the suit, or gives such security as the court thinks sufficient for
making such payment within fifteen days, the court may, in lieu of making a decree for ejectment,
pass an order relieving the lessee against forfeiture; and thereupon the lessee shall hold the property
leased as if the forfeiture had not occurred. It was submitted that in view of the fact that during the
pendency of suit, the rent arrears have been paid, the provisions of section 114 of the Transfer of
Property Act would come into operation and the Official Liquidator is entitled to continue hold the
leased property.
13.23 The learned counsel, next placed reliance upon the decision of a Division Bench of this court
in Virendra Bhogilal Shah (HUF) v. Official Liquidator of Sarangpur Cotton Man. Co. Ltd. (Unit of
GSTC), rendered on 06.04.2018 in O. J. Appeal No. 13 of 2007, wherein, the court held that
considering the terms of the lease deed it appears that the landlord/lessor has carved out absolute
transferable interest in favour of the lessee in the perpetual lease. There is no forfeiture clause.
There is no right to re-entry. The court held that the decision of the Supreme Court in Jabal C.
Lashkari (supra) shall be applicable with full force to the facts of that case.
13.24 The attention of the court was invited to the provisions of sections 105, 106 and 107 of the
Transfer of Property Act. Reference was made to section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act and
more particularly, to part (B) thereof, which provides for "Rights and Liabilities of the Lessee".
Reference was made to clause (j) thereunder, which provides that the lessee may transfer absolutely
or by way of mortgage or sub-lease the whole or any part of his interest in the property, and any
transferee of such interest or part may again transfer it. The lessee shall not, by reason only of such
transfer, cease to be subject to any of the liabilities attaching to the lease. It was submitted that,
therefore, in case of an ordinary lease, the lessor remains the owner for all purposes, for breach he
can exercise ownership rights to take possession; whereas, in case of a permanent lease, he is only
entitled to receive the rent. It was submitted that all the terms and conditions have to be read
together to ascertain whether the lease of 1911 is a permanent lease or an ordinary lease.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 66Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
13.25 The attention of the court was invited to section 111 of the Transfer of Property Act which
provides for determination of lease, to submit that the lease of immoveable property can be
determined only in the eventualities as envisaged thereunder. It was submitted that none of the
contingencies envisaged under section 111 of the Transfer of Property Act are applicable in the facts
of the present case and hence, the applicant is not entitled to determine the lease. Referring to
clause (g) of section 111 of the Transfer of Property Act, it was pointed out that the same provides
that a lease of immoveable property can be determined by forfeiture in case the lessee breaks an
express condition which provides that, on breach thereof, the lessor may re-enter. However, the
clause requires the lessor or his transferee to give notice in writing to the lessee of his intention to
determine the lease. It was submitted that in the facts of the present case, apart from the fact that
the lease deed of 1911 does not provide for determination of the lease by the lessor, even otherwise,
in the facts of the present case, no notice has been issued for determination of the lease.
13.26 It was submitted that section 15 of the Rent Act permits sub-letting if there is a contract to the
contrary. Therefore, the contract between parties has a pivotal role to play. It was submitted that
when the lease is a permanent lease and no forfeiture clause is expressly set out, sections 15 and 13
of the Rent Act will not apply. It was submitted that the applicant claims leasehold rights through
Calico Limited. Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act enables Jubilee Mills to use the
documents which are not registered as a shield to protect possession and hence, the applicant
cannot claim title on the basis that the agreement of 1983 is unregistered. Furthermore,
non-registration of the agreement will not give rise to any right in favour of the original transferor to
take possession from Jubilee Mills.
13.27 Reference was made to the decision of the Supreme Court in Jabal C. Lashkari v. Official
Liquidator (supra) and the decision of Oudh High Court in Bhagwati Prasad v. Balgobind (supra)
and the decision of the Mysore High Court in Ramacharya Narayana Charya Burli v. State (supra). It
was submitted that in this case, the lease is heritable and transferable and not for a fixed period and
therefore, it is in the nature of a permanent lease. Accordingly, the agreement between Jubilee Mills
and Calico Limited is secondary and it is the lease deed of 1911 which governs all the lessees who
come into the picture. Therefore, it is this lease deed which has to be taken into account. If under
that lease deed of 1911, the property is heritable, the lessor cannot claim that he has a right to take
the property back.
13.28 It was submitted that under section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, part performance has
been taken care of and that, one cannot forget the link between lease deeds of 1911 to 1983 and that,
for all purposes, the lessor has remained constant and that, he cannot enforce any rights against
Jubilee Mills to contend that the deed is not registered. It was further submitted that the present
applications are barred under Articles 66 and 67 of the Limitation Act, 1963, insofar as the ground
of non-use of property is concerned.
14. Mr. D.S. Vasavada, learned counsel for the respondent - Textile Labour Association, at the
outset, has adopted the submissions advanced by Mr. Kamal Trivedi, learned counsel for the Official
Liquidator.

14.1 The learned counsel further submitted that the Supreme Court in Jabal C. Lashkari (supra) has
except in the case of Jabal Lashkari, remanded the rest of the OJ Appeals, with a clear direction that
the High Court should examine the clauses of the lease deed in each of the matters. It was submitted
that O.J. Appeal No.1 of 2003 was preferred against the order passed in Company Application No.16
of 1999, wherein a judgment was delivered by the Division Bench, which was challenged before the
Supreme Court in the special leave petition. It was submitted that it was the lease deed dated 4th
August, 1911, which was on the record of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has remanded the
case with a direction to examine the clauses of the lease deed in line with the observations and
principles of law laid down in O.J. Appeals No.64, 65 and 66 of 2006. It was submitted that in view
of this direction, the High Court has to confine itself within the scope and ambit of the judgment
delivered in Jabal C. Lashkari (supra) and that any adjudication beyond that will not be permissible.
It was submitted that the Supreme Court delivered the judgment in March, 2016 and O.J. Civil
Application No.358 of 2016 has been filed to consider the Deed of Assignment which was made by
Calico Mills with Jubilee Mills in 1983. The Deed of Assignment was not on the record of the O.J.
Appeal No.1 of 2013 and, therefore, adjudication of the O.J. Civil Application No.358 of 2016 will be
beyond the scope and purview of the judgment of the Supreme Court.
14.2 Without prejudice to the aforesaid contention, the learned counsel has submitted that a notice,
that is, prior notice before filing the company application has to be given to the lessee which is a
mandatory requirement and it has been held in Jabal C. Lashkari (supra) that issuance of prior
notice to the lessee by the lessor for claiming the possession and arrears of rent is a legal necessity,
whereas, in the present case, in both the matters, that is, Company Application No.16 of 1999 and
OJ. Civil Application No.358 of 2016, prior notice has not been given before filing the proceeding in
the High Court. Therefore, the mandatory requirement is not met with and both the applications
deserve to be dismissed on this ground alone.
14.3 It was further submitted that the issue of transfer of all assets from Calico Limited to Jubilee
Mills has been adjudicated and this court in Company Application No.302 of 1999 has clearly held
that the transfer is complete and it is legal and documents could not be executed or registered
because of legal embargo under the Urban Land Ceiling Act. It was pointed out that this order of the
learned Single Judge was carried in O.J. Appeal and the O.J. Appeal was withdrawn in 2015. Thus,
the order has become final and, therefore, the applicant cannot be heard to contend that the Deed of
Assignment of 1983 is illegal and cannot be looked into for want of registration under the
Registration Act.
14.4 Next, it was submitted that lease is of permanent nature and is perpetual and does not provide
for a forfeiture clause. It was contended that even under the provisions of Transfer of Property Act
and relevant clauses in the lease deed, there is a provision of issuance of prior notice for recovery of
rent and claiming back the possession. However, this mandatory requirement is also not complied
with and, therefore, on this ground also both the matters are required to be dismissed.
14.5 It was submitted that in Jabal C. Lashkari (supra) the Supreme Court has clearly held that the
provisions of the Transfer of Property Act will prevail and the Rent Act will not apply. Therefore, the
arguments advanced by the applicant regarding violation of the provisions of the Rent Act pale into
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 68Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
insignificance.
14.6 Lastly, it was submitted that in any matter under the Companies Act, sections 529 and 529(A)
thereof cannot be ignored by the court hearing company matters. In the present case, Jubilee Mills
(in liquidation) was employing 3287 workmen and their total dues as ascertained by the Chartered
Accountant are more than Rs.25 crores. The workmen have received only Rs.6 crores. The winding
up order was passed in 1989. Even after thirty one years, the workmen have not received their dues
and during this intervening period, more than 1100 workmen have passed away. It was submitted
that the Official Liquidator should be empowered to transfer the leasehold rights for consideration
and he should be allowed to comply with the provisions of sections 529 and 529(A) of the
Companies Act for payment of the workers dues and dues of the secured creditors. The learned
counsel placed on record a statement of the outstanding dues of the workmen in respect of various
mill companies.
14.7 Reliance was placed upon the decision of this court in State Bank of India v. Official Liquidator
of Commercial Ahmedabad Mills Co. & Ors., 2009 (1) GLR 420, wherein the court held thus:-
"15. In fact, when Section 529-A of the Act was proposed to be introduced vide Companies
(Amendment) Bill, 1985, the statement of object and reasons provided as under:-
"Another announcement made by the Finance Minister in his Budget speech relates
to the decision of the Government to introduce necessary legislation so that
legitimate dues of workers rank pari passu with secured creditors in the event of
closure of the company and above even the dues to Government. The resources of the
companies constitute a major segment of the material resources of the community
and common good demands that the ownership and control of the resources of every
company are so distributed that in the unfortunate even of its liquidation, workers,
whose labour and effort constitute an invisible but easily perceivable part of the
capital of the company are not deprived of their legitimate right to participate in the
product of their labour and effort. It is accordingly proposed to amend Sections 529
and 530 of the Companies Act and also to incorporate a new Section in the Act,
namely Section 529A vide clauses 4, 5 and 6 of the Bill)."
16. In case of T.L.A. Vs. Official Liquidator reported in 2004(3) GLH 416, the Apex Court was called
upon to decide the true scope of provisions of Section 529-A of the Act in light of the priority
claimed by Oil and Natural Gas Commission on the basis of an order made by the Apex Court in
favour of ONGC. The Supreme Court has laid down as under:-
"8. The effect of Sections 529 and 529-A is that the workmen of the Company become
secured creditors by operation of law to the extent of the workmen's dues provided
there exists secured creditor by contract. If there is no secured creditor then the
workmen of the company become unsecured preferential creditors under Section
529-A to the extent of the workmen's dues. The purpose of Section 529-A is to ensure
that the workmen should not be deprived of their legitimate claims in the event of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 69Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
liquidation of the Company and the assets of the Company would remain charged for
the payment of the workers' dues and such charge will be pari passu with the charge
of the secured creditors. There is no other statutory provision overriding the claim of
the secured creditors except Section 529-A. This Section overrides preferential claims
under Section 530 also. Under Section 529-A the dues of the workers and debts due
to the secured creditors are to be treated pari passu and have to be treated as prior to
all other dues.
9. Therefore, the law is clear on the matter as held in UCO Bank's case that Section
529-A will override all other claims of other creditors even where a decree has been
passed by a Court.
10. Therefore, claims, if any, of O.N.G.C. will have to be worked out in accordance
with Sections 529 and 529-A of the Companies Act as well. The contention advanced
on behalf of O.N.G.C. by Shri Raju Ramchandran that if a mandamus had been
issued, it will prevail over any law is not tenable and is rejected."
14.8 It was submitted that for all purposes the workmen have a first charge over the property of the
company in liquidation and, therefore, they have a first charge over the leasehold interest in the
subject property. It was submitted that workmen dues get priority over all other dues and this aspect
may not be lost sight of.
15. In rejoinder, Ms. Megha Jani, learned counsel for the applicant submitted that insofar as the
contention of the learned counsel for the respondents that the lease of 1911 is a permanent lease is
concerned, such lease is a periodic lease of one year at a time. Attention was invited to clause (1) of
the lease deed of 1911, to submit that on a consideration of the recitals contained therein, it is
evident that it is a periodic lease of one year at a time, whereby the rent has to be paid before the
commencement of the year, and if not paid, the lessors have a clear right to enter and forfeit the
land. It was submitted that this clause is not a residuary clause but is the first clause and the terms
and conditions of the lease deed start with this clause. It was submitted that thus there is a very
clear forfeiture clause and right of entry in the lease deed.
15.1 The attention of the court was invited to clause (10) of the lease deed of 1911 which provides that
"the rent of the said farmlands shall be payable with effect from 15.6.1911 and if we want to
surrender the farmlands then from the date of taking the same on rent till a period of ten years, we
cannot leave them, despite which if we surrender them, then you, your guardians, heirs shall be
entitled to recover ten years rent at a time from us, our guardians, heirs and in respect of the same
we, our guardians, heirs shall not raise any kind of dispute or objection and if, after a period of ten
years is over, we want to surrender the said farmlands then in the year in which we surrender the
same, we will not raise any claim for the rent paid prior thereto and if we want to surrender the land,
we shall remove the construction on the land from the foundation and level the land and handover
the possession to you, and if you have to do it, you shall be entitled to recover the entire costs from
us".

15.2 It was submitted that thus clause (10) of the lease deed provides for a minimum duration of ten
years and above and that while it is not a fixed term lease, it is a periodic lease. In support of such
submission, the learned counsel placed reliance upon the decision of a Full Bench of this court in
Nanalal Girdharlal and another v. Gulamnabi Jamalbhai Motorwala and others, (1972) 13 GLR 880,
wherein the court held thus:-
"5. We may now proceed to consider the true nature and character of a periodic lease.
It is evident that the duration of the term in a periodic lease is continuous from
period to period. The interest of the lessee does not terminate at the end of the period
but continues indefinitely from period to period until determined by a notice to quit
given by the lessor or the lessee. The characteristics of a periodic tenancy from year to
year have been stated with great clarity and precision by the Court of Exchequer
Chamber in the early case of Grandy v. Jubber, (1868) 9 B. & S. 15:
"There frequently is an actual demise from year to year so long as both parties please.
The nature of this tenancy is discussed in 4 Bac. Abr. Lit. Lease and Terms for years
pp. 838. 839. 7th ed., and the article has always been deemed of the highest
authority. It seems clear that the learned author considered that the true nature of
such a tenancy is that it is a lease for two years certain, and that every year after it is a
springing interest arising upon the first contract and parcel of it so that if the lessee
occupies for a number of years, these years by computation from the time past, make
an entire lease for so many years, and that after the commencement of each new year
it becomes an entire lease certain for the years past and also for the year so entered
on and that it is not a reletting at the commencement of the third and subsequent
years. We think this is the true nature of a tenancy from year to year created by
express words, and that there is not in contemplation of law a recommencing or
reletting at the beginning of each year."
5. When one period comes to an end and the tenancy goes into the next period, it does so by virtue
of the original contract of lease and as a direct consequence of it and not because of any fresh
contract of reletting. There is no common assent between the lessor and the lessee arrived at afresh
for continuing the tenancy into the next period. The tenancy goes on from period to period by force
of the original contract of lease until the contract is determined by notice to quit on the part of either
lessor or lessee. Now where there are two or more co-owners who have granted a periodic tenancy,
the contract of tenancy can be put an end to only by the joint action of all co- owners and the notice
to quit must, therefore, be given by or on behalf of all co-owners. What has commenced under the
common volition of all co-owners can be brought to an end only by a fresh common volition on their
part. Vide the observations of Sir Lallubhai Shah J. in Maganlal v. Bhudar 29 Bom. LR 222 at p. 226
= (AIR 1927 Bom 192). No one co-owner who is a tenant-in-common can also terminate the tenancy
as to his undivided share alone for the contract of tenancy is one and indivisible and it cannot be
split up except by consent of all who are parties to it. Vide Baraboni Coal Concern Ltd. v. Gokul
Anand. 61 Ind.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 71Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
App. 35 at P. 39 = (AIR 1934 PC 58). It is, therefore, obvious on first principle that all co-owners
must join in giving notice to quit determining a periodic tenancy. This would appear to be so also on
a plain reading of Section 108 in cases falling within that Section, Section 106 says that in the
circumstances there mentioned a lease shall be deemed to be a lease from year to year or from
month to month terminable on the part of either lessor or lessee by notice to quit. Now singular
includes the Plural and therefore where there are two or more lessors, the notice to quit must be
given by all lessors. We cannot construe the words "on the part of....--lessor" as if they were "on the
part of...lessor or any one of the lessors where there are more than one lessor." Vide the reasoning of
Warrington. J., in Re Viola's Indenture of Lease (1909) 1 Ch. 244 as explained by Somervell LJ in
(1952) 2 QB 988 (supra)."
It was submitted that, therefore, the lease in question is a periodic lease and not a permanent lease.
15.3 Reliance was also placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Hamidullah (Dead) by his
Legal Representatives and others v. Sheikh Abdullah and others, (1972) 4 SCC 800, wherein the
court held that the mere fact that a uniform fixed rent had been paid for a long time or the fact that
the lessees were in possession of the land for a long time and were making constructions on the land
at their own cost would not, in the circumstances of the case raise a presumption that the tenancies
were of permanent character. The court held that in every case an inference of permanency of
tenancy is a question of fact depending upon the facts of each particular case. The court referred to
its earlier decision in Bejoy Gopal Mukherji v. Praful Chandra Ghose, AIR 1953 SC 153, wherein it
was held that neither possession for generations at uniform rent nor construction of permanent
structures by itself is conclusive proof of permanent tenancy. It is the cumulative effect of these
circumstances coupled with several other facts that may lead to an inference of permanent tenancy.
15.4 It was submitted that on a perusal of the clauses of the lease deed of 1911, it is evident that the
intention of the parties is to create a lease from year to year and not for all times to come. It was
submitted that all the judgments cited by the learned counsel for the respondents deal with fixed
term lease deed and, therefore, those judgments would not be applicable to the facts of the present
case.
15.5 It was submitted that the decision of the Division Bench of this court in Virendra Bhogilal Shah
(HUF) v. O.L. of Sarangpur Cotton Man. Co. Ltd. (Unit of G.S.T.C.) (supra) will not apply to the facts
of the present case because in the facts of that case (i) the lease was a permanent lease;
(ii) there was a concession of the learned advocate for the appellant to the effect that they were not
claiming possession of the land; (iii) they had limited their claim to possession; and
(iv) concession was also to the effect that Rent Act is not applicable. It was submitted that in that
case there were in all four transfers but the middle two transfers were validated by an Act enacted by
the State Legislature and by order of this court. The attention of the court was invited to paragraph
4.4 and 4.18 of the decision, to submit that the matter was not argued on the basis of the provisions
of the Rent Act. Attention was invited to paragraph 8.6 of the judgment, wherein the conditions of
the lease deed have been set out, to submit that there was no clause for re-entry or forfeiture in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 72Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
said lease deed. Moreover, the lease deed does not spell out the purpose for which it was given. It
was submitted that the first condition reproduced in the judgment clearly says that the property has
been leased permanently, condition No.13 also says that the second party has taken the land on
lease permanently from the first party, and the last clause says that the first party do alienate the
land in the name of the second party. It was submitted that the conditions of the lease deed in the
said case being totally different from the conditions of the lease deed in the present case, the said
decision will not apply to the facts of this case.
15.6 Reference was made to section 535 of the Companies Act which provides for disclaimer of
owners property in case of a company which is being wound up. It was submitted that once the
company dissolves, the Official Liquidator can do nothing with the land, inasmuch as, in the present
case the leasehold rights are not an asset of the company, and hence, it is not permissible for the
Official Liquidator to sub-let or sub- lease the same.
15.7 Reference was made to the decision of this court in Uttra Achyut Chinubhai v. O.L. Of
Nanikram Shobhraj Mills (supra), and more particularly to the directions contained in clause (c) of
paragraph 31 thereof which reads as under:-
"(c) Upon any objection received, the OL shall move, within 15 days from the date of
receipt of such objection, report to this Court on the said aspects for appropriate
orders. In absence of objection of any other person or the Court passing orders upon
such report and after removal of super-structure by the offerer/purchaser, whose
offer may be accepted by this Court, whichever is later, the OL would not be required
to retain the property any further.
Hence, within two weeks after the said later date, after drawing proper inventory and panchnama,
the possession of the property shall be handed over by the OL to the applicant."
15.8 Reliance was also placed upon the decision of this court in Anil Private Limited v. O.L. of GSTC
(supra), wherein the court has observed thus: "
14. From the undisputed facts which have come on record, it is apparent that there is
no deed of lease and the company in liquidation had occupied the premises in
question on a monthly tenancy. The nature of the tenancy therefore itself shows that
the tenancy was terminated every month subject to payment of rent. There is no
dispute that the premises in question situated at Mumbai are not of any use so far as
the Official Liquidator is concerned. The premises are not required by the company
for the purpose of business of the company or for the purpose of winding up the
Company in liquidation.
15. In a situation which was more or less identical the Apex Court was called upon to
decide the question raised before me. In the case before the Supreme Court the date
of commencement of lease was not available nor was it claimed on behalf of the
liquidator that the lease was of long duration. It was also an agreed position tht for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 73Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
the purpose of winding up or for business of the Company the liquidator did not need
the premises. In such circumstances when the High Court had permitted the
liquidator to enter into a care taker agreement by virtue of which a third party as put
in possession of the premises, the Supreme Court held that:
"11. The learned Company Judge could not have permitted holding on to possession
of the premises, not needed for efficiently carrying on winding up proceedings. The
only course open to him was to direct the Liquidator to surrender possession to
landlords and save recurring liability to pay rent."
16. Applying the aforesaid ratio to the facts of the case, the liquidator is hereby directed to handover
the vacant and peaceful possession of the premises....."
15.9 Reliance was placed upon the decision of this court in Dhairyasinh P Rajda v. Ahmedabad
Manufacturing & Calico Printing Mills Company Ltd, (supra) whereby the learned Company Judge
directed the Official Liquidator to handover peaceful and vacant possession of the property in
question after removing the seal to the applicant and co- owners, if any.
15.10 Ms. Jani submitted that under section 535 of the Companies Act, the Official Liquidator has
the power to disclaim any property which is onerous. It was submitted that the Official Liquidator
does not have any right to sub-lease or sub-let the property in question nor does he require the
subject property for the purposes of winding up, and hence, the Official Liquidator be directed to
handover the possession of the subject property to the applicant.
15.11 It was submitted that section 23 of the Registration Act provides for the time for presenting
documents and lays down that no document other than a will shall be accepted for registration
unless presented for that purpose to the proper officer within four months from the date of its
execution. It was submitted that the contention advanced on behalf of the Official Liquidator that
the agreement of 1983 can still be registered, being contrary to the provisions of section 23 of the
Registration Act, does not merit acceptance.
15.12 It was submitted that rights of a statutory tenant are not assets of the company and hence, the
bar of section 19 of the Rent Act would apply. It was further submitted that statutory tenant cannot
sub-lease the land. In support of such submission the learned counsel placed reliance upon the
decision of the Bombay High Court in N.M. Nayak v. Chhotalal Hariram (supra).
15.13 It was submitted that section 15 and section 5(1) of the Rent Act refer to the original lessee and
not a sub- lessee. It was submitted that the transfer from Calico Limited to Jubilee Mills is unlawful
as the agreement is not registered. It was submitted that the provisions of section 15 of the Act
which provide that subject to a contract to contrary, are available only to the lessee and not to a
sub-lessee.
15.14 It was submitted that transfer from Calico Limited to Jubilee Mills being unlawful, the
applicants have a right to seek eviction under section 13(e) of the Rent Act. It was submitted that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 74Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
Official Liquidator cannot further assign the subject property as there is no valid contract and that
even if there is a valid contract, he cannot further assign the subject property as he is a sub-lessee.
Moreover, section 19 of the Rent Act prohibits such a transfer. It was urged that only land is lying
and all the buildings, plants and machinery have been removed, therefore, dissolution of the
company is a certainty; the subject property is an asset which the official liquidator does not require;
there are mounting dues and rent has not been paid; and hence, the subject property is required to
be returned to the applicants.
15.15 Reliance was placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Board of Trustees of the Port of
Mumbai v. M/s. Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Pvt. Ltd. , 2011 (5) SCR 157. Reliance was also placed upon
the decision of the Supreme Court in K.K. Krishnan v. M.K. Vijaya Raghavan, (1980) 4 SCC 88,
wherein the court in the context of sub- section (4) of section 11 of Kerala Buildings (Lease and Rent
Control) Act, 1965 held that read plainly and without gloss, the section simply and clearly, means
that a tenant may be evicted on the ground of sub-letting unless such subletting is permitted by a
term of the lease itself or by subsequent consent of the landlord. What is necessary is an application
of the mind and the resulting consensus between the landlord and the tenant.
16. At the time when the matters were initially heard and kept for dictation, Mr. Uday Bhatt, learned
advocate had appeared on behalf of the State Bank of India and had adopted the submissions made
by the learned counsel for the Official Liquidator and Textile Labour Association.
17. In the backdrop of the facts and contentions noted hereinabove, the first question that arises for
consideration is, whether the lease deed dated 4.8.1911 is a permanent/perpetual lease. Considering
the view that the court in inclined to take in the matter, the question as to whether or not the lease is
a permanent lease would pale into insignificance, but having regard to the fact that the learned
counsel for the respective parties have addressed the issue at length, and the Supreme Court has
remanded the case to the High Court to consider the question as to what would be the effect of the
principles underlying its decision in Jabal C. Lashkari (supra) vis-à-vis the specific clauses of the
lease deed between the parties in each of the cases, the court deems it fit to answer this question.
18. Before adverting to the merits of the case, it may be apposite to refer to the principles enunciated
by the Supreme Court as well as other courts in the decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for
the respective parties.
19. In A. Caspersz v. Kader Nath Sarbadhikari, (supra), the Calcutta High Court, was of the opinion
that the facts of the said case viz. long possession by the defendants and their ancestors, the fact of
the landlord having permitted them to build a pucca house upon it, that the house has been there for
a very considerable time; it had been built by successive tenants, and that the tenure had from time
to time been transferred by succession and purchase, in which the landlord is found to have
acquiesced, or of which he could not have been ignorant as he accepted rent from the transferees;
were sufficient to warrant the court in presuming that the tenure was of a permanent nature.
20. In Mt. Afzal un Nissa v. Abdul Karim and others, (supra), the Privy Council referred to the above
referred judgment of the Calcutta High Court.

21. In Sivayogeswara Cotton Press, Devangere v. M. Panchaksharappa, (supra) on the question of
interpretation of the document, the Supreme Court noticed that it was a lease of the demised
premises for a term of twenty years certain, on payment of Rs.350 annual rent in advance, even
though the lessee may not continue to occupy the demised land; that the lessee had been granted a
right to continue the lease of the demised premises as long as the lessee desired to do so; that on his
choosing to continue to enjoy the leasehold, the lessee was obliged to pay annually the enhanced
rent of Rs.400 for the next ten years after October 1, 1934, and after the expiration of the ten years
aforesaid, the rent was further enhanced to the sum of Rs.500 per annum; that the lessee was given
the option to give up the lease at any time after October 1, 1934, without any further liability for
payment of the stipulated rent; that the lessor bound himself not to call upon the lessee at any time
to give up possession of the lease-hold as long as the lessee was prepared to observe the terms of the
lease; that the lessee was fully authorised "to erect, as many buildings, godowns, factories,
bungalows and other structures etc." as also to pull down and re-erect structures or to make any
alterations, as desired by him; that the lessor undertook not to raise any objection to the lessee
making those structures or his using or enjoying the land in any way or for any purposes according
to his desire; that the lessor undertook to pay the annual assessment to the Government in respect
of the demised premises but the lessee was obliged to pay all fines and other taxes which the
Government might impose for granting permission to convert the culturable land into land meant
for building factories and other structures as contemplated between the parties that if the lessee
chose to give up possession of the demised premises, he shall be entitled to take away all machinery,
iron and steel, woodworks etc. of the factories, buildings and other structures that may be standing;
that in the event of a default in the payment of the annual rent fixed as aforesaid, upon notice of
demand served upon the lessee, the lessor reserved the right to retake possession of the demised
land. The lessee was also declared to be always entitled to sub-let or re-let the demised/land to any
person and on any terms. The terms and conditions of the lease which created the rights and
obligations between the lessor and the lessee were specifically declared to be binding on the heirs
and successors-in-interest of the lessor and the lessee.
21.1 The court further noted that on a plain construction of the terms aforesaid of the lease deed, it
should be manifest that the purpose of the transaction was a building lease that though there was
liberty reserved for the lessee or his successor to give up the lease-hold at any time after October 1,
1934, no corresponding right was reserved to the lessor. The court found that the lease was heritable
and assignable and thus there was no room for the contention, on the terms of the lease, that the
parties intended that after the lapse of the first twenty years of the lease, the tenancy will be merely a
tenancy at will. The court held that it was clearly a tenancy for an indefinite period, at the least. The
court held that where the land is let out for building purposes without a fixed period, the
presumption is that it was intended to create a permanent tenancy.
21.2 The court was of the opinion that the presumption raised by the fact that the lease was for
building purposes and, therefore, intended to be permanent is not weakened by the fact that the
lessee had stipulated with the lessor to be entitled to give up possession if and when he decided to do
so. It is a right reserved in favour of the lessee and did not confer, any corresponding right on the
lessor. The court held that such a right in favour of the lessee cannot be converted into a disability or
an obligation which should detract from the grant of a permanent tenancy. Such a stipulation which
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 76Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
gives a right to the tenant to surrender the lease-hold at any time he decided to do so, if it is coupled
with a corresponding right in the landlord to serve notice of ejectment at any time he chose to do so
may have the effect of making the tenancy, a tenancy at will.
21.3 The court agreed with the decision of the Bombay High Court in Bavasaheb Walad
Mansursaheb Korti v. West Patent Press Co. Ltd., AIR 1954 Bom 257, wherein the court held that
the nature of the tenancy created by any document must nevertheless be determined by construing
the document as a whole. If the tenancy is for a building purpose, prima facie it may be arguable that
it is intended for the life-time of the lessee or may in certain cases be even a permanent lease. Prima
facie such a lease is not intended to be, tenancy at will. But whether it is a tenancy for life or a
permanent tenancy must ultimately depend upon the terms of the contract itself. And in construing
the terms of such contracts the courts must look at the substance of the matter and decide what the
parties really intended to do. In the facts of the case before it, the Supreme Court noted that the
lease was intended by the parties to be heritable and assignable. It was a lease for twenty years
certain, and then in terms which were not wholly unequivocal in respect of the period after the lapse
of the initial twenty years. That the lease was not intended to be for the life only of the grantee was
clear not only from the facts already noticed, namely, that it was meant for building purposes, was
heritable and assignable and had not reserved any right to the lessor to terminate the tenancy.
22. In A.H. Forbes v. Hanuman Bhagat (supra), the Patna High Court, upon considering the terms
of the lease found that the lease was for the purpose of gola business and for building houses. It was
also clear that the erection of pucca buildings for the business as well as for the purpose of residence
was in the contemplation of the parties with the condition that permission for erecting pucca
structures will have to be taken from the lessor. The court held that under these circumstances,
inference is not unreasonable that the lease in question was meant to be of a permanent character
and not from year to year.
23. In Chapsibhai Dhanjibhai Danad v. Purushotttam (supra), the Supreme Court, after considering
the principles enunciated in its earlier decision in Sivayogeswara Cotton Press v. M.
Panchaksharappa (supra), in the facts of the case before it held that looking to the document as a
whole, the lease undoubtedly was for building a residential structure. Though it was for thirty years
certain, the lessee was entitled to remain in possession of the land so long as he paid the stipulated
rent which the lessor was not entitled to increase. But, though the lease was for building structure
and the period was indefinite, there were at any rate no express words indicating that the leasehold
rights thereunder were intended to be heritable. On the other hand, it expressly provided for the
right of the lessee to remove the structures, meaning thereby vacating the land, if he so desired. The
clause providing for such removal was not that the lessee would remove the structures on default in
payment of rent, but depended on his own volition, which according to the Supreme Court was a
clause indicative of the parties not having intended the lease to be permanent. The court held that if
it was intended to be permanent, there was no necessity for providing such a right. It was argued
before the court that there were words in the document indicative of the lease having been intended
to be heritable as in the case in Sivayogeswara Cotton Press (supra). The court held that the mere
fact that a lease provides for the interests thereunder to pass on to the heirs of the lessee would not
always mean that it is a permanent lease. Such a provision can be made in two ways resulting in two
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 77Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
different consequences. A lease may provide a fixed period and then include a provision that in the
event of the lessee dying before the expiry of such period, his heirs would be entitled to have the
benefit of the lease for the remainder of the period. In such a case, although the lease may provide
for the heirs to succeed to the interests in the leased land, it would only mean that such heirs
succeed to the rights up to the expiry of the lease period. If the lease, on the other hand, were for an
indefinite period, and contained a provision for the rights thereunder being heritable, then, such a
lease, though ordinarily for the lifetime of the lessee, would be construed as permanent.
23.1 Reference may be made to the contents of the deed in the above case, as referred to in
paragraph 11 thereof, which read thus:-
"11. After reciting the purpose for which it was made, the term of 30 years and the
rent, the deed provides:
"Even after the prescribed time-limit, I shall have a right to keep my structure on the
leased out land, so long as I like, and I shall be paying to you the rent every year as
stated above."
Though the period is 30 years, this part of the document would make the lease for an indefinite
period which would ordinarily mean a lease for the lifetime of the lessee. What follows then,
however, gives scope for the argument that it is not merely for the lifetime of the lessee:
"You will have no right to increase the rent and I shall also not pay it, myself and my
heirs shall also not pay it, myself and my heirs shall use this land in whatever manner
we please. After the lease period, we shall, if we like, remove our building right from
the foundation and vacate your land. In case we remove our structure before the
stipulated period, we shall be liable to pay to you, the rent for all the thirty years, as
agreed to above."
And further.
"In case I were to sell away the buildings, which I shall be constructing on the above
land, to anyone else, then, the purchaser shall be bound by all the terms in this lease
deed."
23.2 The court held that this part of the document undoubtedly gives the lessee the right to transfer
by sale the leasehold interest; but observed that a clause enabling the leasehold interest to be
transferred does not render such interest heritable. The court further held thus:-
"12. The effect of these clauses is that the first part of the document ensures that the
lessor cannot charge rent higher than the agreed rent even if the lessee were to
remain in possession after the period of 30 years. That part is consistent with the
lease being for an indefinite period, which means for the lifetime of the lessee. The
next part provides for the right to remove the structures "after the lease period". The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 78Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
words "after the lease period" mean either at the end of the 30 years, or on the death
of the lessee, because, it also says that if the lessee were to remove the buildings
before the expiry of 30 years, he would have to pay the rent for the remainder of that
period. This part of the document does not show the intention that the lease was to be
a permanent lease. It merely ensures the right to remove the structures if the lessee
or his heirs so desired on the expiry of the lease period i.e. either at the end of 30
years, or after the lifetime of the lessee. The heirs are mentioned here to provide for
the contingency of the lessee dying before the expiry of 30 years and also for the
contingency of his living beyond that period and continuing to occupy the land. In the
event of the first contingency, the lessee's heirs would continue in possession till the
expiry of 30 years and then remove the structures if they wished. In the case of the
second contingency, the heirs of the lessee would have the right to remove the
structures on the death of the lessee. In either event the right provided for is the right
to remove the structures. It is not a provision for the lease being heritable and its
being consequently a permanent lease. Thus, the lease is for a period certain i.e. 30
years and on the expiry of that period if the lessee still were to continue to pay the
rent, for his lifetime. In the event of his dying before that period, the benefit of the
lease would enure to his heirs till the completion of 30 years. They would be entitled
to remove the structures either at the end of the 30 years if the lessee were to die
before the expiry of that period or at the end of the lessee's life were he to continue to
be in possession of the leased property after the expiry of 30 years. But the lease did
not create hereditary rights so that on the death of the lessee his heirs could succeed
to them.
13. In this connection, it is necessary to note that, as translated in English, It would
appear as if the document uses the pronoun 'I' meaning as if the lessee, in the earlier
part and the pronoun 'we' meaning the lessee and his heirs, in the latter part. Such a
translation, however, is not correct. We ascertained from Mr. Ratnaparkhi who after
looking at the original Marathi assured us that the pronoun used throughout is Ami,
which means "we", a term often used in document written in regional language for
the executant instead of the singular 'I'.
14. In our view the lease before us is clearly distinguishable from that in the case of
Sivayogeswara Cotton Press (supra) where the leasehold rights were in clear terms
made heritable and where the court held that clause (14), though placed last in the
document, governed all its terms. There is no provision in the present case
comparable with such a clause. The lease was undoubtedly for an indefinite period
which only means that it was to enure for the lessee's lifetime. Reference in it of the
heirs of the lessee is only for the limited purposes set out earlier and not for making
the leasehold interests heritable. We do not find in the document words such as those
in Sivayogeswara Cotton Press (supra) which would compel us to the conclusion that
the lease was intended to be permanent."

24. In the facts of the present case, on behalf of the respondents, it has been contended that the
lease deed dated 4th August, 2011 is a permanent lease/perpetual lease. In this regard reference has
been made to the clauses contained in the lease deed, to submit that the terms thereof are peculiar
and do not provide for any specific number of years. However, the intention of the parties has to be
gathered from the terms of the lease and the purpose for which it was given and the conduct of the
party. It was submitted that the purpose of the lease appears to be for establishing textile mill or for
any other purpose including putting up building thereon. The lease deed does not have any clause
which permits the lessor to determine the lease and further provides that till the lessee pays the
rent, the lessor has no right to take over the possession and the lessor has no right to increase the
rent. It was submitted that all these clauses go to show that the lease was given on a permanent
basis. It was further submitted that clause (6) of the deed permits the lessee to sell/transfer, etc. its
leasehold rights to any person, which again is a strong indication of the permanent/perpetual lease.
It was contended that a consequence of the lease being a perpetual lease is that the lessors cannot
claim back possession as there is no forfeiture clause as per the lease deed, which is also a ground
mentioned in section 13 of the Rent Act. On the other hand, on behalf of the applicant it has been
contended that considering the clauses contained in the lease deed, it is a lease from year to year
and is a periodic lease and it contains a clear forfeiture clause.
25. For the purpose of ascertaining the nature of the lease, it may be germane to refer to the recitals
contained in the lease deed of 1911, to understand as to what was agreed between the parties and the
nature of the lease.
26. The original lease deed is in the vernacular language and as translated in English and to the
extent it is relevant for the present purpose, reads as under:-
The opening part of the lease deed refers to the parties and below that is a table
showing the description of the land given on lease. Below the table it is stated thus:
"The farmlands within the four boundaries wherein in number 53 there is a well and
along with the well we have kept all the farmlands on rent from you for the purpose
of constructing buildings for textile mill or similar use or for any other purpose or for
use in any other manner. The rent for the same will be Rs.500 per annum payable in
advance. The resolution in that regard is as under:
1. The duration of the rent note is till we pay the said amount of rent every year in
advance, that is, before the commencement of the year and if in this manner we or
our heirs, administrators do not pay the rental amount then you, your heirs,
advocates may give three months notice and if within that period we do not pay the
rent then we shall remove our buildings and if within the notice period we fail to do
so then you, your heirs, advocates may take possession and from then the possession
shall be deemed to be yours and if we, our heirs, administrators etc. continue to pay
the rental amount as stated above, till the time we give the rent, you or your heirs or
administrators shall not have the right to recover possession from us and take
possession of the farmlands at any time, also you shall have no right to increase the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 80Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
rent.
2. Xxx
3. As stated in the first clause till we pay the rental amount, you or your guardians,
heirs cannot take possession of the farmlands and if you or your heirs in any manner
execute any deed in respect of the lands, even then till the rent of the farmlands is
paid, they or their heirs or administrators cannot take possession of the lands from us
and the sole right shall be to recover the rental amount.
4. xxxxxxx ..
5. Upon digging the farmlands, if any mineral is found then it is yours and we, our
guardian, heirs shall not have any right, but if any bricks or stones are found we can
use them.
6. If we keep the building constructed on the farmlands and machines installed
thereon permanently and transfer them by sale or in any other manner then the same
shall be given by retaining all the conditions of the lease deed, whereby the purchaser
shall be deemed to have accepted all the conditions of the lease deed.
7. to 9. xxxxx
10. The rent shall start running from 15th June, 1911 and if we have to surrender the
farmlands then we cannot surrender them before ten years from the date when they
have been kept on rent; despite which if we surrender them then you shall recover ten
years rent at a time from us or our guardians or heirs and we or our guardians or
heirs shall not raise any dispute and if we want to surrender the lands after ten years,
then in the year in which they are surrendered we shall not raise any dispute or seek
any right to refund of the rent paid for that year prior thereto and if we want to
surrender the lands, we shall remove the construction on the lands from the
foundation and level the land and hand over the possession to you and if you have to
do it, you shall be entitled to recover the entire costs from us.
11. & 12. Xxxx
13. Under all the clauses referred to hereinabove, wherever "we" has been written it at
every place it should be understood as, we, our guardians, heirs, administrators and
wherever your has been written there it should be understood as you, your guardian,
heirs , advocates, assignees ..... ...
27. On a perusal of the above clauses of the lease deed, it is manifest that nowhere in the entire lease
deed has it been stated that the lease is a permanent or a perpetual one. Therefore, what has to be
examined is the intention of the parties upon consideration of the agreement as a whole.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 81Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
28. Clause (1) of the lease deed, which is the first condition, provides that the duration of the lease
deed is till the lessee pays the rent annually in advance before the commencement of the year; and in
case of default, the lessor can give three months notice, and upon failure on the part of the lessee to
pay the rental amount within the notice period, the lessor is entitled to take possession and is
deemed to be in possession. Thus, this clause provides for the duration of lease, which is indefinite,
but terminable on the happening of an event, namely, failure to pay the rent. Thus, this condition
can be termed to be a forfeiture clause.
29. It may be noted that while clause 13 of the lease deed says that in the lease deed where 'we' is
mentioned it should be understood as 'we, our heirs, administrators, assignees', and where 'you' is
mentioned it should be understood as 'your guardian, heirs, advocates, assignees'but nowhere does
it say that the lease is heritable.
30. On a perusal of clause (3) of the lease deed, which is the clause which permits transfer of the
leasehold rights, shows that what the parties intended was transfer of the subject property with
building, plant and machinery which were permanent in nature, and not vacant land. Therefore, the
intention of the parties appears to be to permit transfer of leasehold rights as a going concern.
31. Clause 10 of the lease deed provides for a minimum term of the lease, viz. ten years, for which
the lessee is bound to pay the rent, even if he surrenders the land before the expiry of ten years.
Thereafter, there is no terminus as to till when the lease should continue, but it is terminable at the
instance of the lessee, provided that the lessee would not be entitled to recover the amount paid in
advance for the year in which the lease is relinquished. In terms of the decision of the Supreme
Court in Chapsibhai Dhanjibhai Danad v. Purushottam (supra), this can be said to be indicative of
the intention of the parties not to create a permanent lease. Besides, clause 10 further provides that
when the lessee relinquishes the lease, he shall remove all the buildings from the foundation and
level the land. The clause providing for such removal is not that the lessee would remove the
structures on default in payment of rent, but depends on his own volition, which in terms of the
decision of the Supreme Court in Chapsibhai Dhanjibhai Danad v. Purushottam (supra) is a clause
indicative of the parties not having intended the lease to be permanent. For, if it was intended to be
permanent, there was no necessity for providing such a right. In the opinion of this court, having
regard to the terms and conditions of the lease deed of 1911, it is the decision of the Supreme Court
in Chapsibhai Dhanjibhai Danad v. Purushottam (supra) which would more appropriately be
applicable and not the decision in Sivayogeswara Cotton Press (supra).
32. In Hamidullah (Dead) By his Legal Representatives v. Sheikh Abdullah, (supra), the Supreme
Court referred to its earlier decision in the case of Bejoy Gopal Mukherji v. Praful Chandra Ghose,
AIR 1953 SC 153, wherein it was held that neither possession for generations at uniform rent nor
construction of permanent structures by itself is conclusive proof of permanent tenancy. It is a
cumulative effect of these circumstances coupled with several other facts that may lead to an
inference of permanent tenancy.
33. In the light of the above discussion, it appears that while the duration of the lease is indefinite, it
is not permanent in nature.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 82Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
34. On behalf of the applicant, reliance has been placed upon the decision of this court in the case of
Nanalal Girdharlal and another v. Gulamnabi Jamalbhai Motorwala, (supra) for the purpose of
contending that the lease deed of 1911 is a periodic lease. In the above decision, a Full Bench of this
court was considering the true nature and character of a periodic lease. The court observed that it is
evident that the duration of the term in a periodic lease is continuous from period to period. The
interest of the lessee does not terminate at the end of the period but continues indefinitely from
period to period until determined by a notice to quit given by the lessor or the lessee. The court
observed that the characteristics of a periodic tenancy from year to year have been stated with great
clarity and precision by the Court of Exchequer Chamber in the early case of Grandy v. Jubber.
(1868) 9 B. & S. 15, wherein it was held thus:
"There frequently is an actual demise from year to year so long as both parties please.
The nature of this tenancy is discussed in 4 Bac. Abr. Lit. Lease and Terms for years
pp. 838. 839. 7th ed., and the article has always been deemed of the highest
authority. It seems clear that the learned author considered that the true nature of
such a tenancy is that it is a lease for two years certain, and that every year after it is a
springing interest arising upon the first contract and parcel of it so that if the lessee
occupies for a number of years, these years by computation from the time past, make
an entire lease for so many years, and that after the commencement of each new year
it becomes an entire lease certain for the years past and also for the year so entered
on and that it is not a reletting at the commencement of the third and subsequent
years. We think this is the true nature of a tenancy from year to year created by
express words, and that there is not in contemplation of law a recommencing or
reletting at the beginning of each year."
The Full Bench held that when one period comes to an end and the tenancy goes into the next
period, it does so by virtue of the original contract of lease and as a direct consequence of it and not
because of any fresh contract of reletting. There is no common assent between the lessor and the
lessee arrived at afresh for continuing the tenancy into the next period. The tenancy goes on from
period to period by force of the original contract of lease until the contract is determined by notice to
quit on the part of either lessor or lessee.
35. In the opinion of this court, the lease in question cannot be said to be a periodic lease, inasmuch
as, in terms of the above decision, the contract is determinable by notice to quit on the part of either
lessor or lessee, whereas in the facts of the present case, the lessor has no right to issue a notice to
quit except in the case of non-payment of rent.
36. Assuming for the sake of argument that the lease of 1911 is a permanent lease, the next question
that arises for consideration is whether Jubilee Mills through the Official Liquidator is entitled to
the benefit of such lease.
37. From the facts as noted hereinabove, it emerges that the lease deed of 1911 was executed between
the predecessors of the applicant and Ahmedabad Jubilee Spinning and Manufacturing Company
(Ahmedabad Manufacturing Company). Thereafter, Ahmedabad Manufacturing Company executed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 83Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
an agreement dated 29.03.1941 in favour of Ahmedabad Manufacturing and Calico Printing
Company Limited (Calico Limited) by way of a registered deed. Thus, the leasehold rights of
Ahmedabad Manufacturing Company came to be transferred in favour of Calico Limited. Thereafter,
Calico Limited executed an unregistered deed dated 24.06.1983 in favour of Gaurav Chemtex
Industries Limited ( Gaurav Chemtex/Jubilee Mills) whereby the vendor, that is, Calico Limited
transferred to the purchaser one of the divisions of the vendor company viz. Jubilee Mills as a going
concern, together with the assets, property rights and benefit thereof.
38. On behalf of the applicant, it has been contended that the lease deed dated 24.6.1983 being an
unregistered deed, there is no lawful assignment of leasehold rights in favour of Jubilee Mills.
39. The aforesaid contention has to be examined in the light of the provisions of the Transfer of
Property Act and the Registration Act as well as the decisions cited by the learned counsel for the
respective parties.
40. Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act says that a lease of immovable property from year to
year, or for any term exceeding one year or reserving a yearly rent, can be made only by a registered
instrument. All other leases of immovable property may be made either by a registered instrument
or by oral agreement accompanied by delivery of possession. Thus, the mandate under section 107
of the Transfer of Property Act is that in case of a lease of immovable property exceeding one year,
the same can be made only by a registered document.
41. Section 17 of the Registration Act, bears the heading "Documents of which registration is
compulsory". Sub-section (1) of section 17 provides that the documents specified thereunder shall be
registered. The present case falls under clause (d) thereof which reads thus: "leases of immovable
property from year to year, or for any term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent".
42. Section 49 of the Registration Act provides for the effect of non-registration of documents
required to be registered and reads as under:-
"49. Effect of non-registration of documents required to be registered - No document
required by section 17 or by any provision of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of
1882), to be registered shall -
(a) affect any immovable property comprised therein, or
(b) confer any power to adopt, or
(c) be received as evidence of any transaction affecting such property or conferring
such power, unless it has been registered;
Provided that an unregistered document affecting immovable property and required under that Act
or the Transfer of Property Act (4 of 1882) to be registered may be received in evidence of a contract
in a suit for specific performance under Chapter II of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 (3 of 1877), or as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 84Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
evidence of any collateral transaction not required to be effected by registered instrument."
43. On behalf of the Official Liquidator, it has been contended in the light of the proviso to section
49 of the Registration Act, it is permissible for the Official Liquidator to rely upon the unregistered
agreement as evidence of any collateral transaction not required to be effected by registered
instrument, though he may not be able to claim title to the property on the basis of such agreement.
To test this contention, reference may be made to the decision of the Supreme Court in Anthony v. K
C Itoop & Sons (supra), wherein, the court, in the context of section 107 of the Transfer of Property
Act and sections 17 and 49 of the Registration Act and the facts of the said case where the lease deed
was unregistered, held that such an instrument cannot create a lease on account of three-pronged
statutory inhibitions contained in section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act, section 17(1) and
section 49 of the Registration Act. The court further held that the said finding does not exhaust the
scope of the issue whether the appellant therein was a lessee of the building. The court referred to
the definition of lease of immovable property as defined in section 105 of the Transfer of Property
Act and has held once there is a transfer of right to enjoy the property, a lease stands created. The
court referred to the three paragraphs of the first part of section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act
and observed that the first paragraph deals with the mode of creating the particular kinds of leases
mentioned therein and the third paragraph can be read along with the above as it contains a
condition to be complied with if the parties choose to create a lease as per a registered instrument
mentioned therein. All other leases, if created, necessarily fall within the ambit of the second
paragraph. Thus, de hors the instrument parties can create a lease as envisaged in the second
paragraph of section 107 which reads thus:
"All other leases of immovable property may be made either by a registered
instrument or by oral agreement accompanied by delivery of possession."
44. In Samir Mukherjee v. Davinder K. Bajaj (supra), the Supreme Court held that under section 107
of the Transfer of Property Act, parties have an option to enter into a lease in respect of an
immovable property either for a term less than a year or from year to year, for any term exceeding
one year or reserving a yearly rent. If they decide upon having a lease in respect of any immovable
property from year to year or for any term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent, such a
lease has to be only by a registered instrument. In the absence of a registered instrument, no valid
lease from year to year or for a term exceeding one year or reserving a yearly rent can be created.
45. In K.B. Saha & Sons (P) Ltd. v. Development Consultant Ltd. (supra), the Supreme Court culled
out the following principles:-
1. A document required to be registered, if unregistered is not admissible into
evidence under section 49 of the Registration Act.
2. Such unregistered document can however be used as an evidence of collateral
purpose as provided in the proviso to section 49 of the Registration Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 85Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
3. A collateral transaction must be independent of, or divisible from, the transaction
to effect which the law required registration.
4. A collateral transaction must be a transaction not itself required to be effected by a
registered document, that is, a transaction creating, etc. any right, title or interest in
immovable property of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards.
5. If a document is inadmissible in evidence for want of registration, none of its terms
can be admitted in evidence and that to use a document for the purpose of proving an
important clause would not be using it as a collateral purpose.
45. In Anthony v. K.C. Ittoop (supra) the Supreme Court held that since the
instrument of lease was unregistered there was no scope of holding the appellant
lessee by virtue of the said instrument. It was further held that the court is disabled
from using the instrument as evidence and hence it goes out of consideration in that
case, hook, line and sinker. The court however held that the above finding does not
exhaust the scope of the issue whether the appellant was a lessee of the building. The
court observed that when a lease is a transfer of a right to enjoy the property and such
transfer can be made expressly or by implication, the mere fact that an unregistered
document came into existence would not stand in the way of the court to determine
whether there was in fact a lease otherwise than through such deed. The court held
that when it is admitted by both the sides that the appellant was inducted into the
possession of the building by the owner thereof and that the appellant was paying
monthly rent or had agreed to pay rent in respect of the building, the legal character
of the appellant's possession has to be attributed to a jural relationship between the
parties. Such a jural relationship on the fact situation of the case, cannot be placed
anything different from that of lessor and lessee falling within the purview of the
second paragraph of section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act. The court held that
since the lease could not fall within the first paragraph of section 107 it could not
have been for a period exceeding one year. The court observed that the further
presumption is that the lease would fall within the ambit of residuary second
paragraph of section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act and that taking a different
view would be contrary to the reality when parties clearly intended to create a lease
though the document which they executed had not gone into the processes of
registration. That lacuna had affected the validity of the document, but what had
happened between the parties in respect of the property became a reality.
Non-registration of the document had caused only two consequences. One is that no
lease exceeding one year was created. Second is that the instrument became useless
so far as creation of the lease is concerned. Nonetheless the presumption that a lease
not exceeding one year stood created by conduct of parties remains unrebutted.
47. In Park Street Properties (P) Ltd. v. Dipak Kumar Singh (supra) the Supreme
Court relied upon its earlier decision in Anthony v. K.C. Ittoop (supra) and held that
in the absence of registration of a document, what is deemed to be created is a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 86Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
month-to-month tenancy, the termination of which is governed by section 106 of the
Transfer of Property Act.
48. In Suraj Lamp & Industries (P) Ltd. (2) v. State of Haryana (supra), the Supreme
Court has held that a lease can be validly transferred only under a registered
assignment of lease.
49. As to what rights flow in favour of Jubilee Mills under the agreement dated
24.6.1983, it is required to be examined in the light of the above decisions and
statutory provisions,. It is an admitted position that the said agreement is an
unregistered document. Since the agreement of 1983 purports to convey the
leasehold rights under the agreement of 1911, which is for a period exceeding one
year, in the light of the provisions of section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act, such
lease can be created only by a registered instrument. Similarly under section 17(1)(d)
of the Registration Act also, a lease deed of an immovable property for any term
exceeding one year is compulsorily required to be registered.
50. Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act provides for (i) a lease deed of
immovable property exceeding one year to be made only by a registered instrument;
(ii) all other leases of immovable property may be either by a registered instrument
or by oral agreement accompanied by delivery of possession;
(iii) where lease of immovable property is made by a registered instrument, such instrument or
where there are more instruments than one, each such instrument shall be executed by both the
lessor and the lessee. In the present case, since under the agreement of 1983, leasehold rights for a
term exceeding one year under the lease deed of 1911 which relates to immovable property are
transferred, in view of the provisions of section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act and section 17 of
the Registration Act, it is required to be registered. However, as held by the Supreme Court in the
above referred decisions, in the absence of registration no valid lease from year to year or for a term
exceeding one year or reserving a yearly rent can be created. However, as held by the Supreme Court
in Anthony v. K C Itoop & Sons (supra), non-registration of the document causes two consequences:
(i) that no lease exceeding one year is created; and (ii) that the instrument becomes useless so far as
creation of the lease is concerned. Nonetheless, there is a presumption that the lease would fall
within the ambit of residuary second paragraph of section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act. As
held by the Supreme Court in Park Street Properties (P) Ltd. v. Dipak Kumar Singh (supra), in the
absence of registration of a document, what is deemed to be created is a month-to-month tenancy,
the termination of which is governed by section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act.
51. Thus, in the light of the principles enunciated in the above decisions, the unregistered agreement
dated 26th April, 1983 is deemed to create a month-to-month tenancy, termination whereof is
governed by section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act.
52. Another question which is required to be addressed is whether it is permissible for Jubilee Mills
to fall back upon the agreement of 1911 for contending that its rights flow under the said agreement
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 87Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
and that in view of the terms and conditions of the said agreement, the provisions of the Rent Act
would not apply.
53. In this regard, reference may be made to the decision of the Supreme Court in Bajaj Auto Ltd. v.
Behari Lal Kohli, (supra), wherein it was urged on behalf of the appellant therein that in view of the
provisions of section 49 of the Registration Act, it is entitled to rely upon an unregistered document
for "collateral purpose". The court held that the clause in the lease deed could not be looked into for
want of registration of lease deed. Reference was made to the decision of the Supreme Court in
Sachindra Mohan Ghose v. Ramjash Agarwalla, (1988) 1 SCC 70, for the proposition that if a decree
purporting to create a lease is inadmissible in evidence for want of registration, none of the terms of
the lease can be admitted in evidence and that to use a document for the purpose of proving an
important clause in the lease is not using it as a collateral purpose. The court held that the question
whether the lessee is entitled to create a sub-lease or not is undoubtedly a term of the transaction of
lease, and if it is incorporated in the document, it cannot be disassociated from the lease and
considered separately in isolation. If a document is inadmissible for non-registration, all its terms
are inadmissible including the one dealing with landlord's permission to his tenant to sub-let. The
court, accordingly, held that the appellant therein could not be allowed to rely upon the clause in his
unregistered lease deed.
54. In K.B. Saha & Sons (P) Ltd. v. Development Consultant Ltd.(supra), the Supreme Court held
that a document required to be registered, if unregistered is not admissible into evidence under
section 49 of the Registration Act. Such unregistered document can however be used as an evidence
of collateral purpose as provided in the proviso to section 49 of the Registration Act. The court held
that a collateral transaction must be independent of, or divisible from, the transaction to effect
which the law required registration. A collateral transaction must be a transaction not itself required
to be effected by a registered document, that is, a transaction creating, etc. any right, title or interest
in immovable property of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards. If a document is
inadmissible in evidence for want of registration, none of its terms can be admitted in evidence and
that to use a document for the purpose of proving an important clause would not be using it as a
collateral purpose.
55. In the facts of the present case, on behalf of the Official Liquidator of Jubilee Mills, reliance has
been placed upon the clauses of the lease deed of 1911, to submit that the lease is of a permanent
nature and that the same permits the lessee to transfer and further assign the leasehold rights. It
cannot be gainsaid that the condition which permits the lessee to transfer the leasehold rights is an
important condition of the lease deed. The Official Liquidator seeks to place reliance upon the
condition of lease deed of 1911 on the basis of the transfer of leasehold rights under the unregistered
agreement of 1983. Since the condition of transfer of leasehold rights exceeding one year requires a
document to be registered, the agreement of 1983 cannot be looked into for the purpose of
establishing such right inasmuch as it cannot be said to be a collateral transaction. As held by the
Supreme Court, a collateral transaction itself must not be required to be effected by a registered
document. The transaction creating any right, title or interest in immovable property of the value of
hundred rupees and upwards is not a collateral transaction, and hence, cannot be admitted in
evidence. Once the document of 1983 cannot be admitted in evidence, the lease deed of 1911 cannot
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 88Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
be looked into as the rights under the lease deed of 1911 are based upon the agreement of 1983
which is an unregistered document. Hence, the agreement of 1983 or the lease deed of 1911 cannot
be read in evidence in the facts of the present case.
56. On behalf of the respondents, it has been contended that Calico Limited transferred its leasehold
rights of the property to Gaurav Chemtex Industries and the said transfer has been acted upon and
complete, as held by this court in the case of ICICI Limited v. Official Liquidator of Ahmedabad
Manufacturing and Calico Printing Limited (supra), the title of the land has passed in favour of
Jubilee Mills. It is contended that in the light of the observations made in the above decision, and in
the light of the fact that the entire transfer has taken place, the provisions of section 53A of the
Transfer of Property can be invoked and it is not open for anyone to contend otherwise. In this
regard, reference may be made to the above referred decision of this court in ICICI Limited v.
Official Liquidator. In that case, ICICI Limited claimed that Calico Limited had created a charge
over its immovable property in its favour including assets of its Jubilee Mills Division which were
transferred to Gaurav Chemtex Industries. That it was not a party to the agreement dated 24.6.1983
and that Calico Limited continues to be liable and the said property and charge created thereupon
continue to be valid in favour of ICICI Limited. The basic question which was required to be
considered in that case was, whether the property in question could be said to be of Jubilee Mills
and whether ICICI Limited could be said to have any charge over the said property which was in the
possession of the Liquidator of Jubilee Mills. The basic controversy, therefore, was about the right,
title and interest of ICICI Limited in the subject matter. On behalf of ICICI Limited, a contention
was raised that immovable properties owned by Calico could only be transferred by registered
conveyance executed by Calico in favour of Jubilee Mills and in the absence of a registered
conveyance; the immovable properties continue to be owned by Calico. The court held thus:-
"38. Xxxxxxx I agree with the submission of Mr.A.L. Shah, appearing for the O.L. of
the Calico, that the possession of the entire Unit, undertaking, business and
operations and its custody and control was handed over to Jubilee pursuant to the
Agreement in question and most part of the Agreement was actually performed and
in performance of the said Agreement, possession of movable as well as immovable
properties were transferred to and handed over to Jubilee and in view of the
restriction under the Land Ceiling Act, conveyance of the immovable property could
not be executed as the permission and clearance of land ceiling Authorities were
awaited. However, simply because of the fact that no conveyance had taken place, the
present applicant cannot take advantage of that situation and there is nothing on
record to show that there was any subsisting charge in their favour at the relevant
time and in absence of the same, naturally, the applicant would not have any locus
standi to challenge the said transaction especially when the applicant is a stranger to
the said agreement."
However, so far as the facts of the present case are concerned, the question is whether as back as in
1983, the property was transferred by virtue of agreement in favour of Jubilee and whether Jubilee
has become the owner from the aforesaid date of transfer having been put in possession of the
property in question. From 1983 onwards, the property were in the possession of Jubilee and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 89Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
everybody treated Jubilee as its owner. There is nothing on record to show that at any point of time
Calico had ever tried to assert its rights over the property in question. The agreement as such was
acted upon. A Reference to Clause 8 is already made earlier and by virtue of the aforesaid transfer
itself, the Jubilee had become owner of the same. Real owner Calico had never objected at any point
of time asserting any right in their favour in the property in question. The present applicant is not a
party to the said Agreement in question. There is nothing to show that there is any valid registered
charge in their favour at the time when the property was transferred in the year 1983. In that view of
the matter, it is not open for the applicant, therefore, to question the agreement in question or to say
that the property, as such, belongs to Calico and for want of a registered document of conveyance,
the title has not passed on in favour of Jubilee. It is true that a tenant cannot claim adverse
possession. Here, the question is not of adverse possession, but the question is whether Jubilee has
become the owner of the property in question by substantially performing the contractual
obligations as per the agreement. In the facts and circumstances of the case, therefore, it is not
possible to believe that the title has not passed in favour of Jubilee. In any case, it is not open for the
present applicant to challenge the aforesaid transaction or even the title of Jubilee as per the facts
and circumstances stated hereinabove."
57. Examining the facts of the present case in the light of the above decision, in the present case the
applicant is not disputing the transaction between Calico Limited and Jubilee Mills. What is being
contended that in view of the fact that the agreement dated 24.6.1983 is not a registered document,
it is not a valid deed, and hence, no reliance can be placed on the clauses contained therein by the
respondent Jubilee Mills. It is the case of the applicants that section 107 of the Transfer of Property
Act mandates that a lease of immovable property from year to year or for any term exceeding one
year or reserving a yearly rent can be made only by a registered deed. Since the agreement dated
24.6.1983 is not a registered document, in the light of the principles propounded by the Supreme
Court in Anthony v. K.C. Ittoop & Sons (supra) and Park Street Properties (P) Ltd (supra), non
registration of the document has two consequences, one is that no lease exceeding one year is
created; and secondly, the instrument becomes useless so far as creation of the lease is concerned,
but there is a presumption that a lease not exceeding one year stood created by the conduct of the
parties. Thus, in the absence of registration of the agreement, what is deemed to be created is a
month-to-month tenancy, the termination of which is governed by section 106 of the Transfer of
Property Act.
58. The applicant is not disputing that by virtue of the unregistered agreement Calico Limited
transferred its leasehold rights in favour of Jubilee Mills. What is contended is that in view of the
fact that the agreement of 1983 is unregistered, the lease created in favour of Jubilee Mills does not
exceed one year. Besides, as held by the Supreme Court in K.B. Saha & Sons Private Limited v.
Development Consultant Limited (supra), a document required to be registered, if unregistered is
not admissible in evidence under section 49 of the Registration Act. While such document can be
used as evidence of collateral purpose as provided in the proviso to section 49 of the Registration
Act, the collateral transaction must be independent, or divisible from the transaction to effect which
the law required registration. The collateral transaction must be a transaction not itself required to
be effected by a registered document, that is, a transaction creating, any right, title or interest in
immovable property of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards. If the document is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 90Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
inadmissible in evidence for want of registration none of its terms can be admitted in evidence and
that to use the document for the purpose of proving an important clause would not be using it as a
collateral purpose.
59. Adverting to the facts of the present case, the Official Liquidator does not rely upon the
agreement for a collateral purpose but for the purpose of proving the lease hold rights of the
company in liquidation over the subject property, which is required to be effected by a registered
deed. Since the agreement of 1983, being an unregistered document is not admissible in evidence,
none of its clauses, including the clause whereby the leasehold rights of Calico Limited are
transferred to it can be admitted in evidence. Besides, the controversy involved in the case of ICICI
Limited v. Official Liquidator (supra) is confined to the parties to the said dispute and is not a
judgment in rem. The rights decided in that case were between Calico Limited and Jubilee Mills and
not the lessors and Jubilee Mills and hence, the said decision does not in any manner affect the
rights of the applicant. The contention based upon the above referred decision, therefore, does not
deserve acceptance.
60. In the opinion of this court, Calico Limited by executing the agreement of 1983 transferred its
rights over the subject land to Jubilee Mills, but in the light of the fact that the agreement was not
registered, no valid lease from year to year or exceeding one year was created in favour of the
Jubilee Mills and what is deemed to be created is month-to-month tenancy. Accordingly, in the
absence of the tenancy being governed by the conditions of any contract, the tenancy is a statutory
one and would be solely governed by the provisions of the Rent Act.
61. It has been contended on behalf of the respondents that section 53A of the Transfer of Property
Act envisages the doctrine of part performance. Ahmedabad Manufacturing has transferred its
leasehold rights in the subject property to Calico Limited, which is turn has transferred its leasehold
rights to Gaurav Chemtex/Jubilee Mills under the agreement of 1983. Jubilee Mills Ltd. has
performed its part of contract under the agreement of 1983, and hence, the doctrine of part
performance would be attracted in the present case. Therefore, considering the fact that the
agreement of 1983 is not a registered document, while Jubilee Mills may not be in a position to file a
suit based on the agreement, it can certainly rely upon the document in its defence under the
proviso to section 49 of the Registration Act. It was contended that section 53A of the Transfer of
Property Act enables Jubilee Mills to use the deed of 1983 as a shield to protect its possession,
though it may not be able to claim title on that basis. Therefore, non-registration of the agreement of
1983 will not give rise to any right in favour of the original lessor to take possession from Jubilee
Mills.
62. Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act reads thus:
53-A. Part performance.--Where any person contracts to transfer for consideration
any immovable property by writing signed by him or on his behalf from which the
terms necessary to constitute the transfer can be ascertained with reasonable
certainty:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 91Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
and the transferee has, in part performance of the contract, taken possession of the
property or any part thereof, or the transferee, being already in possession, continues
in possession in part performance of the contract and has done some act in
furtherance of the contract, and the transferee has performed or is willing to perform
his part of the contract, then, notwithstanding that, where there is an instrument of
transfer, that the transfer has not been completed in the manner prescribed therefor
by the law for the time being in force, the transferor or any person claiming under
him shall be debarred from enforcing against the transferee and persons claiming
under him any right in respect of the property of which the transferee has taken or
continued in possession, other than a right expressly provided by the terms of the
contract: Provided that nothing in this section shall affect the rights of a transferee
for consideration who has no notice of the contract or of the part performance
thereof.
63. Thus, section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act bars the transferor or any person claiming
under him any right in respect of the property of which the transferee has taken or continued to be
in possession, from enforcing against the transferee and persons claiming under him any right in
respect of the property other than a right expressly provided by the terms of the contract. Insofar as
the unregistered agreement of 1983 is concerned, the transferor is Calico Limited and the transferee
is Jubilee Mills. Therefore, Calico Limited or any person claiming under it any right in respect of the
subject property, for example ICICI Limited which claimed a charge on the subject property through
Calico Limited, is barred from claiming any right other than a right expressly provided by the terms
of the contract. Thus, the doctrine of part performance under section 53A of the Transfer of Property
Act would be applicable to the parties to the agreement and those claiming under them. In the
present case, the applicant does not claim any right in the subject property through either the
transferor or transferee, and hence, the provisions of section 53A would not be applicable. This view
is bolstered by the decision of the Supreme Court in Rambhau Namdeo Gajre v. Narayan Bapuji
Dhotra, (2004) 8 SCC 614:
"8. It is seen that many a times a transferee takes possession of the property in
part-performance of the contract and he is willing to perform his part of the contract.
However, the transferor somehow or the other does not complete the transaction by
executing a registered deed in favour of the transferee, which is required under the
law. At times, he tries to get back the possession of the property. In equity, the courts
in England held that it would be unfair to allow the transferor to take advantage of
his own fault and evict the transferee from the property. The doctrine of
part-performance aims at protecting the possession of such transferee provided
certain conditions contemplated by Section 53-A are fulfilled. The essential
conditions which are required to be fulfilled if a transferee wants to defend or protect
his possession under Section 53-A of the Act that have been culled out by this Court
in Shrimant Shamrao Suryavanshi v. Pralhad Bhairoba Suryavanshi, (2002) 3 SCC
676 are:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 92Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
"16. (1) there must be a contract to transfer for consideration of any immovable
property; (2) the contract must be in writing, signed by the transferor, or by someone
on his behalf; (3) the writing must be in such words from which the terms necessary
to construe the transfer can be ascertained;
(4) the transferee must in part-performance of the contract take possession of the
property, or of any part thereof;
(5) the transferee must have done some act in furtherance of the contract; and (6) the
transferee must have performed or be willing to perform his part of the contract."
9. If these conditions are fulfilled then in a given case there is an equity in favour of the proposed
transferee who can protect his possession against the proposed transferor even though a registered
deed conveying the title is not executed by the proposed transferor. In such a situation equitable
doctrine of part-performance provided under Section 53-A comes into play and provides that:
"the transferor or any person claiming under him shall be debarred from enforcing
against the transferee and persons claming under him any right in respect of the
property of which the transferee has taken or continued in possession, other than a
right expressly provided by the terms of the contract".
10. Protection provided under Section 53-A of the Act to the proposed transferee is a shield only
against the transferor. It disentitles the transferor from disturbing the possession of the proposed
transferee who is put in possession in pursuance of such an agreement. It has nothing to do with the
ownership of the proposed transferor who remains full owner of the property till it is legally
conveyed by executing a registered sale deed in favour of the transferee. Such a right to protect
possession against the proposed vendor cannot be pressed into service against a third party."
[Emphasis supplied.
Thus, the Official Liquidator of Jubilee Mills cannot press into service the right to protect possession
against Calico Limited against the applicant herein.
64. Since the applicant seeks possession of the subject property from the Official Liquidator,
reference may be made to the relevant provisions of the Rent Act. Sub-section (8) of section 5 of the
Rent Act defines "premises"inter alia to mean any land not being used for agricultural purposes.
Sub-section (11) of section 5 of the Rent Act defines "tenant" to mean any person by whom or on
whose account rent is payable for any premises and inter alia includes,-
(a) such sub-tenants and other persons as have derived title under a tenant before the
commencement of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control (Amendment)
Ordinance,1959
65. Part II of the Rent Act is comprised of sections 6 to 31A.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 93Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
Section 6 of the Rent Act bears the heading "Application". Sub- section (1) of section 6 provides that
in areas specified in Schedule I, that Part shall apply to premises let for residence, education,
business, trade or storage and also to open land let for building purposes. A perusal of the Schedule
I of the Rent Act shows that the suit property is located in an area falling under the said Schedule.
66. Section 12 of the Rent Act, to the extent the same is relevant for the present purpose, reads as
under:
"12. No ejectment ordinarily to be made if tenant pays or is ready and willing to pay
standard rent and permitted increases. - (1) A landlord shall not be entitled to the
recovery of possession of any premises so long as the tenant pays, or is ready and
willing to pay, the amount of the standard rent and permitted increases, if any, and
observes and performs the other conditions of the tenancy, in so far as they are
consistent with the provisions of this Act.
xxxxxxx (2) No suit for recovery of possession shall be instituted by a landlord against
a tenant on the ground of non-
payment of the standard rent or permitted increases due, until the expiration of one month next
after notice in writing of the demand of the standard rent or permitted increases has been served
upon the tenant in the manner provided in section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (IV of
1882).
3(a) xxxx
(b) In any other case, no decree for eviction shall be passed in any such suit if, on the first day of
hearing of the suit or on or before such other date as the Court may fix, the tenant pays or tenders in
Court the standard rent and permitted increases then due and thereafter,-
(i) continues to pay or tender in Court such rent and permitted increases till the suit is finally
decided; and
(ii) pays costs of the suit, as directed by the Court."
67. Section 13 of the Rent Act to the extent the same is relevant for the present purpose reads as
under:
"13. When landlord may recover possession. - (1) Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Act [but subject to the provisions of Section 15] a landlord shall be
entitled to recover possession of any premises if the Court is satisfied.-
(a) xxxxx
(b) xxxxx
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 94Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
(c) xxxxx
(d) xxxx
(e) that the tenant has, since the coming into operation of this Act lawfully [sub-let]
the whole or part of the premises or assigned or transferred in any other manner his
interest therein; or
(f) xxxx
(g) that the premises are reasonably and bona fide required by the landlord for
occupation by himself or by any person for whose benefit the premises are held
[where the landlord is a trustee of a public charitable trust that the premises are
required for occupation for the purpose of the trust; or
(h) xxxx
(i) xxxx
(k) that the premises have not been used without reasonable cause for the purpose
for which they were let for a continuous period of six months immediately preceding
the date of the suit"
68. Thus, the Bombay Rent Act envisages recovery of possession by the landlord under the two
provisions, namely, section 12 and section 13 thereof. On behalf of the Official Liquidator, it has
been contended that sub-section (1) of section 13 of the Rent Act provides that the same is subject to
the provisions of section 15. Referring to section 15, it was submitted that the same provides that
notwithstanding anything contained in any law, but subject to any contract to the contrary.
Therefore, if there is a contract to the contrary permitting the lessee to sublet the transfer the
premises, clause (e) of sub-section (1) of section 13 of the Rent Act cannot be invoked. Reliance was
placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Laxmidas Bapudas Darbar v. Smt. Rudravva
(supra, wherein the court observed that in V. Dhanapal Chettiar v. Yesodai Ammal, AIR 1979 SC
1745, it has nowhere been held that by virtue of the provisions of the Rent Act the contract of term
lease is completely obliterated in all respects. The effect of the Rent Act on tenancy under contract
has been considered only to a limited extent, confining it to the necessity of giving notice under
section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. The court, in the context of section 21 of the Karnataka
Rent Control Act, observed that the Rent Acts have primarily been made, if not wholly, to protect the
interest of tenants, to restrict charging of excessive rent and their rampant eviction at will. In that
view of the matter, section 21 of the Karnataka Rent Act provides that notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in any contract, no order for eviction of a tenant shall be made by the court
or any other authority. The court held that the non obstante clause contained under section 21 of the
Act, will override any condition in any contract which may provide a ground for eviction other than
those enumerated in clauses (a) to (p) of sub-section (1) of section 21. Such an additional ground in
a contract shall be rendered ineffective. The court observed that the use of the word "only" in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 95Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
proviso is significant to emphasise that it relates to grounds alone which cannot be added over and
above as provided. The whole contract or other conditions not related to eviction or grounds of
eviction shall not be affected. So far as a fixed term lease is concerned, it shall be affected only to the
extent that even after expiry of period of the lease the possession cannot be obtained by the lessor
unless one or more of the grounds contained in section 21 of the Act are available for eviction of the
tenant. There is nothing to indicate nor has it been held in any case that in view of section 21 of the
Karnataka Rent Act a contract of fixed term tenancy stands obliterated in totality. The court
observed that as indicated in the earlier part of the judgment in the case of Dhanapal Chettiar
(supra) it has been observed in paragraph 5 that none of the State Rent Acts have abrogated or
affected the provisions of section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act which provides for lease of
immovable property from year to year or for a term more than a year or reserving a yearly rent. The
court held that the proviso to sub-section (1) of section 21 of the Karnataka Rent Act limits the
grounds on which a landlord can seek eviction of a tenant. The court further held thus:
"18. The effect of the non obstante clause contained under Section 21 of the
Karnataka Rent Act on the fixed term contractual lease may be explained as follows:
(i) On expiry of period of the fixed term lease, the tenant would be liable for eviction
only on the grounds as enumerated in clauses (a) to (p) of sub- section (1) of Section
21 of the Act.
(ii) Any ground contained in the agreement of lease other than or in addition to the
grounds enumerated in clauses (a) to (p) of sub-section (1) of section 21 of the Act
shall remain inoperative.
(iii) Proceedings for eviction of a tenant under a fixed term contractual lease can be
initiated during subsistence or currency of the lease only on a ground as may be
enumerated in clauses (a) to (p) of sub-
section (1) of Section 21 of the Act and it is also provided as one of the grounds for forfeiture of the
lease rights in the lease deed, not otherwise.
(iv) The period of fixed-term lease is ensured and remains protected except in the cases indicated in
the preceding paragraph."
69. In the opinion of this court, the above decision of the Supreme Court would be applicable
provided there is a contract to the contrary as contemplated under sub-section (1) of section 15 of
the Rent Act. In the light of what is held hereinabove, in the absence of any valid contract assigning
leasehold rights in favour of Jubilee Mills, the decision of the Supreme Court in Laxmidas Bapudas
Darbar v. Rudravva (Smt) (supra) does not in any manner support the case of the Official
Liquidator.
70. On behalf of the Official Liquidator it was submitted that none of the grounds under sub-section
(1) of section 13 of the Rent Act, on which Jubilee Mills is sought to be evicted from the subject
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 96Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
property are made out in the present case. It was submitted that clause (e) of sub-section (1) of
section 13 the Rent Act would not be applicable as there is no forfeiture clause in the lease deed
dated 04.08.1911. On the other hand, the applicant seeks eviction of the respondent-Jubilee Mills on
the ground that the sub-lease in favour of the Jubilee Mills is unlawful because it violates the
provisions of the Registration Act and the Transfer of Property Act because it is not registered and it
also violates the provisions of the Rent Act because Calico Limited itself was a sub-lessee and the
original lessee was Ahmedabad Manufacturing Company, which assigned it to Calico Limited in
1941. Therefore, the status of the Calico was that of a sub-lessee and a sub-lessee cannot further
sublet under the provisions of the Rent Act. It was also contended that the premises have not been
used without any reasonable cause for the purpose for which they were let for a continuous period of
six months immediately preceding the date of the application as contemplated under clause (k) of
section 13(1) of the Rent Act. It was also contended that by a notice dated 02.09.2016, the
respondent-Jubilee Mills had been called upon to pay Rs.10,500/- towards pending arrears of rent
within a period of one month from the date of such notice. However, despite expiration of one
month after such notice in writing of demand of the rent came to be issued to it, such amount had
not been paid, and that an amount of Rs.10,000/- came to be paid only on 10.01.2017 and Rs.500/-
came to be paid on 04.04.2017, therefore, in view of the provisions of sub-section (2) of section 12 of
the Rent Act, the Official Liquidator is required to be evicted from the subject property.
71. Insofar as non-payment of rent is concerned, it has been contended on behalf of the Official
Liquidator that on account of nonpayment of rent, no action can be taken for eviction of the tenant
as section 13 of the Rent Act does not envisage eviction on the ground of nonpayment of rent. In this
regard, reliance has been placed on the decision of the Full Bench of the Karnataka High Court in Sri
Ramakrishna Theatres Ltd. (supra) which was approved by the Supreme Court in Laxmidas
Bapudas Darbar v. Rudravva (supra). The decision in Sri Ramakrishna Theatres Ltd. was rendered
in the context of section 21 of the Karnataka Rent Act, which reads thus:
"21. Protection of tenants against eviction.-- (1) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in any other law or contract, no order or decree for the recovery of
possession of any premises shall be made by any Court or other authority in favour of
the landlord against the tenant :
Provided that the court may on an application made to make an order for the
recovery of possession of a premises on one or more of the following grounds only,
namely :
(a) Xxx to (p)"
Clauses (a) to (p) enumerate the grounds enabling the landlord to recover possession
of the premises from the tenant.
The court inter alia held thus:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 97Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
"9. A plain reading of the opening sentence of Section 21 would show that it imposes
a general ban against the recovery of possession by the landlord of any premises by
evicting the tenant. The substance of the main clause in Section 21(1) is to direct that
"no order or decree for the recovery of possession of any premises shall be made in
favour of the landlord against the tenant". But this clause is not to be read in
isolation. It will have to be read along with the opening clause. In other words it says
that, even though any other law or contract enables the landlord to recover
possession of the premises by an order or decree, no order or decree shall be made by
any court of authority. The bar is actually against the court or the authority from
making an order or decree for the recovery of possession of any premises in favour of
the landlord against the tenant even though any other law or contracts provides for
making such an order or decree. Nowhere this main provision has expressed an
intention to enlarge, the right of the landlord to get an order or decree for the
recovery of possession of the premises. This ban imposed under Sec. 21(1) is lifted
under certain circumstances;
that is to say, if the grounds enumerated in any one of the clauses (a) to (p) are available, the bar
against recovery of possession as stated in Section 21(1) stands lifted.
Thus, the main part of Section 21(1) bars the enforcement of the landlord's right to recover
possession from the tenant; the latter is protected from eviction absolutely. This normal rule of a
ban against eviction and the protection afforded to the tenant against evictions has to give way only
when any one of the grounds enumerated in clauses (a) to (p), exists. In other words, a landlord who
is otherwise entitled to evict his tenant, can recover possession from his tenant, only, under any of
the circumstances falling under clauses (a) to (p) of the Proviso to Section 21(1).
10. Thus a plain reading of the main provision of Section 21 along with its proviso shows that its
object is not to enlarge the rights of the landlord in any manner but actually it is restrictive of his
right to recover possession. For example, if the lease is for a fixed term, under general law, the said
contract of lease would enable the landlord to seek an order or decree for the recovery of possession
of the leasehold on the expiry of the lease period. Such a right is completely taken away by the main
provision of S. 21(1) because the said right is a right, which is contrary to the ban imposed by the
section. The ban would operate at the time recovery of possession is to be sought and it will be lifted
only when any one of the grounds stated in clauses (a) to (p) are proved. The grounds stated in
clauses (a) to (p) of the proviso do not enlarge the rights of the landlord but give him cause, or
causes of action to seek possession of the premises."
72. In this regard, it may be germane to refer to sub-section (1) of section 13 of the Rent Act, which,
to the extent the same is relevant for the present purpose, reads thus:
13. When landlord may recover possession. - (1) Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Act but subject to the provisions of section 15, a landlord shall be entitled to
recover possession of any premises if the Court is satisfied-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 98Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
(a) that, the tenant has committed any act contrary to the provisions of clause (o) of
section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (IV of 1882); or -
(b)xxxx; or
(c) xxxxx; or
(d) xxxxx; or
(e) that the tenant has, since the coming into operation of this Act lawfully sub-let the
whole or part of the premises or assigned or transferred in any other manner his
interest therein; or (ee) xxxx; to (hh) or
(k) that the premises have not been used without reasonable cause for the purpose
for which they were let for a continuous period of six months immediately preceding
the date of the suit; or
(l)xxxxx.
73. Thus, section 21 of the Karnataka Rent Control Act makes provision for protection of tenants
against eviction, whereas section 13 of the Bombay Rent Act provides for the grounds under which a
landlord may recover possession. Moreover, section 21 of the Karnataka Rent Act provides that
recovery of possession can be made on one or more of the grounds enumerated thereunder only. In
other words, it limits eviction under the said Act to the contingencies mentioned in section 21 only.
Whereas, sub-section (1) of section 13 of the Bombay Rent Act does not employ the expression 'only'
and, therefore, does not limit eviction under the said Act to the grounds mentioned thereunder.
Therefore, the sub-section (1) section 13 cannot be read to mean that eviction under the Rent Act
can be only on the grounds laid down therein as is sought to be contended on behalf of the
respondents. In the opinion of this court, while invocation of section 13 of the Rent Act may be
restricted to the grounds specifically provided thereunder, it would still be permissible for a landlord
to seek eviction of the tenant under section 12 of the Rent Act, if the requirements of sub-section (2)
thereof are satisfied. The contention of eviction cannot be sought on the ground of nonpayment of
rent because section 13 of the Act does not envisage recovery on such ground, therefore, does not
merit acceptance.
74. Examining the issue from another angle, if such contention were to be accepted, the same would
render the provisions of sub-section (2) of section 12 of the Rent Act nugatory, which could not have
been the intention of the legislature.
75. The next question that arises for consideration is whether the present case falls under any of the
clauses enumerated in sub-section (1) of section 13 of the Rent Act.
76. It has been contended on behalf of the applicant that clause (11) of section 5 of the Act which
defines "tenant" to include sub tenants and other persons as have derived title under a tenant before
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 99Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
the commencement of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control (Amendment)
Ordinance, 1959 and hence, Ahmedabad Manufacturing Company being a tenant, Calico Limited
was a sub-tenant and a sub-tenant has no right to further sub-let the premises under the provisions
of section 15 (1) of the Act. In this regard, it may be noted that under condition (6) of the lease deed
of 1911, it was permissible for the lessee to transfer the subject property with the buildings and
machinery thereon. Accordingly, Ahmedabad Manufacturing Company, by a registered agreement
dated 29th March, 1941, sold its entire undertaking along with the leasehold rights in the subject
property in favour of Calico Limited. Moreover, the assignment of leasehold rights in favour of
Calico Limited was prior to the commencement of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House
Rates Control (Amendment) Ordinance, 1959. Therefore, in terms of section 5(11) of the Rent Act,
Calico Limited would be the tenant and not Ahmedabad Manufacturing Company as it sought to be
contended on behalf of the applicant.
77. Under sub-section (1) of section 15 of the Rent Act, there is no prohibition against the tenant
subletting the premises subject to the any contract to the contrary. Since the Calico Limited under
the agreement of 1941 was assigned the rights under the lease deed of 1911, which contained a clause
permitting transfer of the subject property, the transfer from Calico Limited in favour of Jubilee
Mills cannot be said to be in breach of the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 15 of the Rent Act.
78. Insofar as the contention that as the agreement of 1987 is not a registered one, it is contrary to
the provisions of section 17 of the Registration Act and is, therefore, unlawful and, therefore, the
applicant is entitled to recover possession under section 13(1)(e) of the Rent Act is concerned, in the
opinion of this court, the mere fact that the agreement of 1983 was unregistered, would not amount
to the sub-letting being unlawful. As held by the Supreme Court in Anthony v. K.C. Ittoop & Sons
(supra), where the lease deed is unregistered, the presumption is that it would fall within the ambit
of the residuary second paragraph of section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act, viz. that it is a lease
for a period not exceeding one year. The ingredients of section 13(1)(e) of the Rent Act are,
therefore, not established in the present case.
79. Insofar as non user of the premises in question is concerned, as contemplated under clause (k) of
section 13(1) of the Rent Act is concerned, in Jabal Lashkari (supra), the Supreme Court, in the facts
of that case has held that clause (5) of the lease deed which deals with non user of the lease land
does not contemplate eviction on account of such non user, but merely entitles the lessor to receive
rent for the period of such non user of the land. In the facts of the present case, a perusal of the
terms and conditions of the lease deed of 1911 indicates that the same does not contemplate any
specific purpose for which the subject land was leased and permits user of the land for any purpose.
There is no condition providing for eviction of the lessee on the ground of non user. Besides, it has
been held hereinabove that the agreement of 1983 not being registered, the clauses of the said
agreement as well as the lease deed of 1911 cannot be read in evidence in this case. Consequently, in
the absence of any condition prescribing the purpose for which the premises are to be used or for
eviction on the ground of non user, the provisions of clause (k) of section 13 (1) of the Rent Act
cannot be invoked.

80. The next question that arises for consideration is whether the applicant is entitled to recover
possession of the subject property under sub-section (2) of section 12 of the Rent Act. Under
sub-section (2) of section 12 of the Rent Act, if the tenant does not pay the rent, then the landlord
may issue notice in writing demanding payment of such rent and serve the same on the tenant in the
manner provided in section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. If till the expiration of one month
from the date of service of such notice, the tenant does not pay the rent, the landlord is entitled to
institute a suit for recovery of possession.
81. However, the benefit bestowed on the tenant under the Rent Act is not limited to entitlement to
a notice as referred to in sub-section (2) of section 12; the tenant is granted further protection under
clause (b) of sub-section (3) of section 12, to the effect that if on the first day of hearing of the suit or
on or before such other date as the court may fix, the tenant pays or tenders in the court the rent and
thereafter continues to pay and tender in court such rent till the suit is finally decided and pays costs
of the suit as directed by the court, no decree of eviction shall be passed in such suit.
82. Examining the facts of the present case in the light of the above statutory provisions, the
applicant company filed Company Application No.16 of 1999 before this court seeking recovery of
possession of the subject property as well as for arrears of rent etc. However, prior to filing the said
application, the applicant had not issued any notice as contemplated under sub-section (2) of
section 12 of the Rent Act and, therefore, he was not entitled to institute a suit for recovery of
possession on the ground of default in payment of rent on the part of Jubilee Mills. The said
application came to be rejected by the learned Company Judge. Against the order of the learned
Company Judge, the applicant preferred O.J. Appeal No.1 of 2003, which came to be decided by a
judgment and order dated 23.10.2008 passed by the Division Bench, whereby the court dismissed
the appeal, but clarified that the secured creditors will provide necessary finance for payment of rent
by the Official Liquidator to the lessors of the property in question, in case the Official Liquidator is
not having the adequate funds for payment of such rent to the lessors. Despite the aforesaid order,
the Official Liquidator did not make any payment of the arrears of rent to the applicant. After the
Supreme remanded the matter to this court for deciding the same afresh, the applicant filed OJ (CA)
No.358 of 2003, once again seeking possession of the subject property and arrears of rent, etc. Such
application came to be filed on or about 5.8.2016. At this point of time also, the Official Liquidator
had still not paid the arrears of rent in terms of the order dated 23.10.2008 passed by the Division
Bench. Thereafter, the applicant issued a notice dated 02.09.2016 to the Official Liquidator of
Jubilee Mills for payment of the arrears of rent, bringing to his attention the order dated 23.10.2008
passed in OJ Appeal No.1 of 2003. The applicant called upon the Official Liquidator to pay the
arrears of rent payable since 1996 within a period of one month from receipt of the notice and also
called upon him to pay the arrears of municipal taxes amounting to Rs.14.11 crores. After receipt of
such notice, the Official Liquidator paid Rs.10,000/- on 10.01.2017 and Rs.500/- was paid on
04.04.2017. Thereafter, the Official Liquidator did not make any further payment till the matter
came up for hearing when once again when during the course of hearing of the matters the issue
regarding non- payment of rent for the subsequent period was raised, whereupon, on 17.03.2020, a
statement was made that the amount of arrears has been paid. Thus, in this case no notice as
contemplated under sub-section (2) of section 12 of the Rent Act, has been issued to the Official
Liquidator of Jubilee Mills prior to filing the application. Under the circumstances, without
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 101Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
satisfying the requirements of under sub-section (2) of section 12 of the Rent Act, the applicant is
not entitled to seek eviction of the Official Liquidator by taking recourse to the said sub-section.
83. On behalf of the applicant, it is contended that the Official Liquidator does not need the subject
property for the purpose of winding-up and hence, the property should be returned back to the
applicant. On the other hand, on behalf of the respondents, it has been contended that the tenancy
rights are an asset of the company in liquidation and, therefore, it is permissible for the Official
Liquidator to transfer such leasehold rights. Strong reliance has been placed in this regard on the
decision of the Supreme Court in case of Jabal C Lashkari v. Official Liquidator (supra). Therefore, it
may be germane to refer to the said decision somewhat in detail.
83.1 In Jabal C Lashkari v. Official Liquidator (supra), while the return of the leased land was sought
on the twin grounds that in view of the winding-up order, the Company no longer required the land
and furthermore default in payment of rent had occurred, for the second relief sought, it was urged
that the Official Liquidator is not authorised to transfer/alienate the lease property in view of the
provisions of the Bombay Rent Act. The Court observed that the Division Bench of the High Court
took note of the fact that the non- obstante clause in section 13 of the Rent Act gave the said section
13 an overriding effect over the other provisions of the Act. Section 13 was also made subject to the
provisions of section 15 of the Bombay Rent Act. This is in contrast of section 21 of the Karnataka
Act which has an overriding effect over any other law or contract to the contrary. Section 15 deals
with the authority of the lessee to sub-lease or assign the leased rights /property, though, gives an
overriding effect over any other law has been made subject to any contract to the contrary.
Therefore, the terms of the lease and other cognate provisions of law is not obliterated. The Supreme
Court observed that in view of the above provisions of the Bombay Rent Act, the Division Bench
went on to hold that the ratio of the decision of the three Judge Bench of the Apex Court in
Laxmidas Bapudas Darbar v. Rudravva (supra) would apply with much greater force for the benefit
of the lessee under fixed long term lease in the State of Gujarat. It was further observed that it is on
the aforesaid basis that the Division Bench came to the conclusion that the Rent Act did not
obliterate the effect of the provisions of section 108 (j) of the Transfer of Property Act which would
vest a right in the lessee not only to sublet but also to assign the subject matter of the lease granted
to him by the original lessor. So far as the contention of the appellants that as company has been
wound up, it no longer required the leased land for its use is concerned, the Supreme Court noted
that the High Court in the impugned judgment, disagreed with the aforesaid proposition as a viable
and acceptable proposition of law. Furthermore, it was held that the liability/obligation to pay rent
for the lease land does not constitute an onerous obligation on the company in liquidation so as to
justify surrender of the leased land by the Official Liquidator or any direction to the said effect under
section 525 of the Companies Act.
83.2 On the question of liability of the Official Liquidator to a decree of eviction on the ground
contemplated under section 13(1)(e) of the Rent Act, the Supreme Court held that the non- obstante
clause of section 13(1) overrides only the other provisions of the Bombay Rent Act and is also subject
to the provisions of section 15. Section 15 which deals with the subletting and transfer, though
overrides the provisions contained in any other law, is subject to any contract to contrary. It was
observed that though in that case, the lease deed, (clause 7) was capable of being read as permitting
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 102Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
subletting and not assigning, but what has been held by the High Court by virtue of the decision of
the Supreme Court in Laxmidas Bapudas Darbar v. Rudravva (supra) is that in view of the limited
operation of the non obstante clause in section 15 of the Bombay Rent Act, unlike section 21 of the
Karnataka Act, the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act [section 118(o)] will not become
irrelevant to the relationship between the parties in which event assignment may also be permissible
notwithstanding the specific content of clause 7 of the lease deed in question.
83.3 Insofar as the relief under section 13(1)(k) of the Bombay Rent Act is concerned, the Supreme
Court observed that what is to be noticed is the requirement of unjustified non- user for a period
exceeding 6 months which evidently was not attracted to the case before it in view of the pendency
of the liquidation proceeding. The court further noted that, that apart from, clause (5) of the lease
deed which deals with non-user of the leased land does not contemplate eviction on account of such
non-user but merely entitles the lessor to receive rent for the period of such non-user of land. The
court held that the mere fact that the company has been ordered to be wound-up cannot be a ground
to direct the Official Liquidator to hand over the possession of the land to the owners, inasmuch as
the company in liquidation continues to maintain its corporate existence until it stands dissolved
upon completion of the liquidation proceeding in the manner contemplated by the Companies Act.
It was further observed that in the case before it, it had been repeatedly submitted before the court
by both the sides that presently revival of Prasad Mills is a live issue pending before the Gujarat
High Court, which was a fact which could not be ignored by the court in deciding the above issue
against the appellants before it.
84. Thus, insofar as invocation of section 13(1)(k) of the Rent Act is concerned, this case would be
squarely covered by the above referred findings recorded by the Supreme Court in Jabal C. Lashkari
(supra).
85. However, insofar as the right of the Official Liquidator to sublet and transfer the subject
property is concerned, in the opinion of this court, the decision of the Supreme Court in Jabal C.
Lashkari (supra), would not be applicable to the facts of the present case. In that case the Supreme
Court was dealing with a case where there was a registered deed in favour of the company in
liquidation, whereas in the facts of the present case, as discussed hereinabove, the lease deed of
1983 being an unregistered deed, none of the conditions contained therein can be read into evidence
in favour of the lessee. Once the conditions of agreement of 1983 cannot be looked into, the question
of considering the conditions of lease deed of 1911 does not arise, inasmuch as it is under the
agreement of 1983 that the leasehold rights under the lease deed of 1911 have been transferred in
favour of Jubilee Mills. Therefore, in effect and substance, in the facts of the present case, there is no
contract to the contrary as envisaged in sub- section (1) of section 15 of the Rent Act. Consequently,
in view of the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 15 of the Rent Act, it shall not be lawful for the
Official Liquidator to sublet the whole or any part of the premises let to the company in liquidation
or to assign or transfer in any manner his interest therein. The contention that it is permissible for
the Official Liquidator to sublet the subject property on the basis of the clauses contained in the
lease deed of 1911, therefore, does not merit acceptance.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 103Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
86. On behalf of the Official Liquidator it has been contended that section 19 of the Rent Act makes
an exception in the case of the proviso to section 15(1) thereof which permits sub- letting in case
where the State Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, permits in any area the transfer
of interest in premises held under such leases or class of leases and to such extent as may be
specified in the notification. It was submitted that since the State Government has issued
notification under section 15(1) of the Rent Act, it is lawful for the Official Liquidator to sell the
leasehold rights. It may be noted that no such notification has been produced on record for the
perusal of this court. However, such notification does find mention in the decision of this court in
Neon Motor Stores & Ors. v. Alliance Stores Trading Co. Ltd., [1974] XV GLR 272, whereby transfer
or assignment incidental to the sale of a business as a going concern together with the stock-in-trade
and the goodwill thereof was permitted provided that the transfer or assignment is of the entire
interest of the transferor or assignor in such leasehold premises together with the business and
stock-in-trade and goodwill thereof. Thus, in terms of the said notification, the leasehold premises
have to be sold as a going concern, whereas in the facts of the present case, the subject property is
vacant land, therefore, the said notification issued under the proviso to sub-section (1) of section 15
of the Rent Act would have no applicability to the facts of the present case.
87. Thus, the applicant has not made out any case for eviction of the respondent - Jubilee Mills from
the subject property on any of the grounds contained in sub-section (1) of section 13 or under
sub-section (2) of section 12 of the Rent Act. At the same time, the Official Liquidator does not need
the subject property for the purpose of winding-up, and for the reasons recorded hereinabove, is
also not in a position to sublet or transfer the subject property in view of the bar contained in
sub-section (1) of section 15 of the Rent Act. Not only that, section 19 of the Rent Act provides that
save in cases provided for under the proviso to section 15, it shall not be lawful for the tenant or any
person acting or purporting to act on behalf of the tenant to claim or receive any sum, or any
consideration as a condition of the relinquishment, transfer or assignment of his tenancy of any
premises. Therefore, transfer of the premises in question for a consideration is hit by sub-
section (1) of section 19 of the Rent Act, which makes such transfer unlawful. Sub-section (2) of
section 19 makes contravention of the provisions of sub-section (1), an offence punishable with
imprisonment and fine as provided therein. Therefore, not only is subletting of the subject property,
barred by sub-section (1) of section 15 of the Rent Act, such subletting is unlawful under sub-section
(1) thereof of section 19 and is an offence punishable with imprisonment and fine under sub-section
(2) thereof. Therefore, in any event, the Official Liquidator cannot sublet or transfer the tenancy
rights in the subject property for a consideration as a condition of such transfer of the tenancy rights
of Jubilee Mills in the subject property.
88. A situation has therefore been created wherein the subject property remains with the Official
Liquidator as the applicant is not entitled to a decree of eviction on any of the grounds enumerated
in sub-section (1) of section 13 or under sub-section (2) of section 12 of the Rent Act. However, the
Official Liquidator neither needs the subject property for the winding-up, nor can he sublet or
transfer the same, but at the same time, he is required to pay the rent for the said premises as well as
the municipal taxes. As noticed earlier the outstanding tax dues payable to the Ahmedabad
Municipal Corporation keeps on increasing and from an amount of approximately Rs.14 crores

which was outstanding when OJ CA.358 of 2016 came to be filed, the outstanding amount has
increased to more than Rs.20 crores.
89. At this juncture, reference may be made to certain precedents on which reliance has been placed
by the learned counsel for the appellant.
89.1 In Uttra Achyut Chinubhai v. O.L. of Nanikram Shobhraj Mills (supra), the learned Company
Judge directed the Official Liquidator after drawing proper inventory and panchnama to hand over
the possession of the property to the applicant.
89.2 In Anil Private Ltd. v. O.L. of G.S.T.C. (supra) the learned Company Judge observed that it was
apparent that there was no deed of lease and the company in liquidation had occupied the premises
in question on a monthly tenancy basis. It shows that the tenancy was terminated every month
subject to payment of rent. There was no dispute that the premises in question situated at Mumbai
were not of any use so far as the Official Liquidator is concerned. The said premises were not
required by the company for the purpose of business of the company or for the purpose of
winding-up of the company in liquidation. The court placed reliance on the decision of the Supreme
Court in Ravindra Ishwardas Shethna (supra). In the facts before the Supreme Court, the date of
commencement of the lease was not available nor was it claimed on behalf of the liquidator that the
lease was of long duration. It was also an agreed position that for the purpose of winding-up or for
business of the company, the liquidator did not need the premises. In such circumstances, the High
Court had permitted the liquidator to enter into a caretaker agreement by virtue of which a third
party was put in possession of the premises. The Supreme Court held that the Company Judge could
not have permitted holding on to possession of the premises, not needed for efficiently carrying on
winding up proceedings and that the only course open to him was to direct the liquidator to
surrender possession to landlords and save recurring liability to pay rent. Applying the aforesaid
ratio to the facts of the case, the learned Company Judge directed the liquidator to hand over the
vacant and peaceful possession of the premises in question.
89.3 In Dhairyasinh P. Rajda v. Ahmedabad Manufacturing & Calico Printing Co Ltd (supra)., the
learned Company Judge directed the Official Liquidator to hand over the peaceful and vacant
possession of the property in question after removing the seal to the applicant and co- owners, if
any, within period of eight weeks from the date of receipt of that order.
89.4 In Ravindra Ishwardas Sethna (supra), the Supreme Court held that the Rent Act is no doubt
enacted for protecting the tenants, and indisputably its provisions must receive such interpretation
as to advance the protection and thwart the action of the landlord in rendering tenants destitute. But
this does not imply that the court should lend its aid to flout the provisions of the Rent Act so as to
earn money by unfair and impermissible use of the premises. And that is what the Liquidator sought
to do and the court extended its help to the Liquidator. The court further held that the learned
Company Judge could not have permitted holding on to possession of the premises, not needed for
efficiently carrying on winding up proceedings. The only course open to him was to direct the
Liquidator to surrender possession to landlords and save recurring liability to pay rent.

90. In the present case, learned advocate for the respondent has placed reliance upon the decisions
cited hereinabove as well as on the provisions of section 535 of the Companies Act which provides
for disclaimer of onerous property in case of a company which is being wound up. Sub-section (1)
thereof provides that where any part of the property of a company which is being wound up consists
of (a) land of any tenure, burdened with onerous covenants, the liquidator of the company
notwithstanding that he has endeavoured to sell or has taken possession of the property, or
exercised any act of ownership in relation thereto, or done anything in pursuance of the contract,
may, with the leave of the Court and subject to the provisions of the section, by writing signed by
him, at any time within twelve months after the commencement of the winding up or such extended
period as may be allowed by the Court disclaim the property. It has been submitted that the Official
Liquidator does not require the subject property for the purpose of winding up and that the same
has become onerous as the Official Liquidator is required to continue paying rent as well as
municipal taxes.
91. In the opinion of this court, payment of an annual rent of Rs.500/-, cannot by any means be
termed to be an onerous covenant, at the same time, the fact that arrears of municipal taxes are
mounting cannot be ignored. In light of the factual position as referred to hereinabove, it is evident
that the Official Liquidator does not require the subject property for the purpose of winding up and
in light of what is held hereinabove, is not empowered to sublet or transfer the subject property for
consideration. Under the circumstances, except that the Official Liquidator is entitled to hold the
subject property till the dissolution of the company, no useful purpose would be served if the Official
Liquidator retains the possession of the subject property.
92. In the aforesaid premises, applying the decision of the Supreme Court in Ravindra Ishwardas
Sethna (supra) to the facts of the present case, the only course open to this court is to direct the
Official Liquidator to surrender the subject property to the landlord, namely, the applicant herein
and save recurring liability to pay rent.
93. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Textile Labour Association had submitted that
the Supreme Court in Jabal C. Lashkari (supra) has except in the case of Jabal Lashkari, remanded
the rest of the OJ Appeals, with a clear direction that the High Court should examine the clauses of
the lease deed in each of the matters. O.J. Appeal No.1 of 2003 was preferred against the order
passed in Company Application No.16 of 1999, wherein a judgment was delivered by the Division
Bench, which was challenged before the Supreme Court in the special leave petition. It was the lease
deed dated 4th August, 1911, which was on the record of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has
remanded the case with a direction to examine the clauses of the lease deed in line with the
observations and principles of law laid down in O.J. Appeals No.64, 65 and 66 of 2006, and,
therefore, the High Court has to confine itself within the scope and ambit of the judgment delivered
in Jabal C. Lashkari (supra) and that any adjudication beyond that will not be permissible.
94. In the considered opinion of this court, the above argument fails to take into consideration the
fact that the lease deed of 1911 is executed in favour of Ahmedabad Manufacturing Company, and
does not vest any right in Jubilee Mills. Any right, title or interest in the subject property insofar as
Jubilee Mills is concerned is based solely on the unregistered agreement of 1983. Therefore, if it is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 106Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
only the lease deed of 1911 which is required to be taken into consideration, Jubilee Mills would not
be able to take any benefit thereunder. It appears that therefor, the learned counsel for the Official
Liquidator has rightly not raised any such contention inasmuch as under the lease of 1911 the
leasehold rights had been transferred in favour of Ahmedabad Manufacturing Company, which is
not defunct and stands dissolved.
95. The learned counsel for the Textile Labour Association has further submitted that in any matter
under the Companies Act, sections 529 and 529(A) thereof cannot be ignored by the court hearing
company matters. It was pointed out that Jubilee Mills (in liquidation) was employing 3287
workmen and their total dues as ascertained by the Chartered Accountant are more than Rs.25
crores. The workmen have received only Rs.6 crores. The winding up order was passed in 1989.
Even after thirty one years, the workmen have not received their dues and during this intervening
period, more than 1100 workmen have passed away. It was submitted that the Official Liquidator
should be empowered to transfer the leasehold rights for consideration and he should be allowed to
comply with the provisions of sections 529 and 529(A) of the Companies Act for payment of the
workers dues and dues of the secured creditors.
96. In the opinion of this court, the above contention would be squarely covered by the decision of
the Supreme Court in Ravindra Ishwardas Sethna v. Official Liquidator (supra) wherein it was
submitted on behalf of the respondent that the creditors and members of the Company in
liquidation have suffered huge losses and if the Liquidator would have been permitted to enter into
an agreement with the second respondent therein, it would fetch a steady income which would have
gone towards mitigating the hardships of the creditors and members of the Company. The court,
however, observed that neither had the accounts of the Company in liquidation been brought to its
notice, nor could it permit violation of law howsoever laudable the object of such act may be.
97. The provisions of section 529 and 529A of the Companies Act, the workmen of the company
become secured creditors by operation of law to the extent of workmen's dues as provided
thereunder. The purpose of section 529A of the Companies Act is to ensure that the workmen should
not be deprived of their legitimate claims in the event of liquidation of the company and the assets
of the company would also remain charged for the payment of workers' dues and such charge will be
pari passu with the charge of the secured creditors. Under section 529A of the Companies Act the
dues of the workers and debts due to the secured creditors are to be treated as pari passu and have
to be treated as prior to all other dues. Thus, section 529 and 529A provide for the assets of the
company remaining charged for the payment of workers' dues, and give the workers' dues priority
over all other dues. However, such charge is on the assets of the Company in liquidation. When it is
not permissible for the Official Liquidator to sublet or assign the leasehold land, any direction issued
by this court empowering the Official Liquidator to transfer the leasehold rights for consideration
and comply with the provisions of section 529 of 529A of the Companies Act would be in violation of
the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 15 and sub- section (1) of section 19 of the Rent Act,
which is also an offence under punishable under sub-section (2) of section 19. Thus, while it is true
that in any matter under the Companies Act, sections 529 and 529(A) thereof cannot be ignored by
the court hearing company matters, it is equally true that the court cannot give any directions that
are contrary to law.

98. In O.J. Civil Application No.358 of 2016, the applicant has also sought substitution of the
Liquidator of Jubilee Mills in place of Ahmedabad Manufacturing Company. Since Ahmedabad
Manufacturing Company had become defunct and stands dissolved, and it is the Liquidator of
Jubilee Mills who seeks benefit of leasehold rights over the subject property under the lease deed
executed in favour of Ahmedabad Manufacturing Company, and has been heard through the learned
Counsel representing him in this case, granting of such relief is a mere formality.
99. To summarise:
- While the duration of the lease deed dated 4th August, 1911 is indefinite, it is not
permanent in nature.
- The lease of 1911 cannot be said to be a periodic lease inasmuch as in case of a
periodic lease the contract is determinable by notice to quit on the part of either
lessor or lessee, whereas in the facts of the present case, the lessor has no right to
issue a notice to quit except in the case of non-payment of rent.
- The agreement of 1983 being an unregistered document, cannot be considered to be
valid for a lease exceeding one year and has to be considered to be for a lease for a
period less than one year as contemplated under second part of Section 107 of the
Transfer of Property Act. The agreement of 1983 is, therefore, deemed to create a
month-to-month tenancy, termination whereof is governed by section 106 of the
Transfer of Property Act.
- The unregistered agreement dated 26th April, 1983 is not a valid document and
none of its clauses, including the clause whereby the leasehold rights of Calico
Limited are transferred to it can be read in evidence.
- Once the agreement of 1983 cannot be admitted in evidence, the lease deed of 1911
cannot be looked into as the rights under the lease deed of 1911 are claimed by the
Official Liquidator under the agreement of 1983. Hence, neither can the agreement of
1983 nor the lease deed of 1911 be read in evidence.
- Since the document of transfer of leasehold rights exceeding one year requires a
document to be registered, the agreement of 1983 cannot be looked into for the
purpose of establishing such right inasmuch as it cannot be said to be a collateral
transaction.
- In the absence of the tenancy being governed by the con- ditions of any contract, the
tenancy is a statutory one and would be solely governed by the provisions of the Rent
Act.
- The controversy involved in the case of ICICI Limited v. Official Liquidator (supra)
is confined to the parties to the said dispute and is not a judgment in rem. The rights
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/155465251/ 108Anilkumar Vaikuthlal Patel vs O.L.Of A'Bad Jubili Spinning & Mfg. ... on 26 March, 2020
decided in that case were between ICICI Limited claiming through Calico Limited
and Jubilee Mills and hence, the said decision does not in any manner affect the
rights of the applicant.
- The doctrine of part performance under section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act
would be applicable to the parties to the agreement and those claiming under them.
In the present case, the applicant does not claim any right in the subject property
through either the transferor or transferee, and hence, the provisions of section 53A
would not be applicable. The Official Liquidator, there- fore, cannot press into service
the right to protect pos- session against Calico Limited against the applicant herein.
- Sub-section (1) section 13 of the Rent Act does not em- ploy the expression 'only'
and therefore, does not limit eviction under the said Act to the grounds mentioned
thereunder. Therefore, sub-section (1) of section 13 can- not be read to mean that
eviction under the Rent Act can be only on the grounds stated down therein. While
invoc- ation of section 13 of the Rent Act may be restricted to the grounds specifically
provided thereunder, it would still be permissible for a landlord to seek eviction of
the tenant under section 12 of the Rent Act, if the require- ments of sub-section (2)
thereof are satisfied.
- Calico Limited falls within the ambit of the expression "tenant" as defined in section
5(11) of the Rent Act.
- Since under the agreement of 1941, Calico Limited was assigned the leasehold rights
over the subject property under the lease deed of 1911, which contained a clause
permitting transfer of the subject property, the transfer from Calico Limited to
Jubilee Mills, is not violative of the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 15 of the
Rent Act.
- In the absence of any condition prescribing the purpose for which the premises are
to be used or for eviction on the ground of non user, the provisions of clause (k) of
section 13 (1) of the Rent Act cannot be invoked.
- No ground for eviction has been made out by the applicant for recovery of
possession under any of the grounds envisaged under section 13 of the Bombay Rent
Act.
- In this case no notice under sub-section (2) of section 12 of the Rent Act has been
issued by the applicant to the Official Liquidator of Jubilee Mills prior to filing either
of the two applications. Consequently, in the absence of the requirements of
sub-section (2) of section 12 of the Rent Act being satisfied, the applicant is not
entitled to seek eviction of the Official Liquidator by taking recourse to the said
sub-section.

- In the present case there is no contract to the contrary as envisaged under section
(1) of section 15 of the Rent Act. Consequently, in view of the provisions of
sub-section (1) of section 15 of the Rent Act, it shall not be lawful for the Official
Liquidator to sublet the whole or any part of the premises let to the company in
liquidation or to assign or transfer in any manner his interest therein;
- In terms of the notification issued under the proviso to sub-section (1) of section 15
of the Rent Act, the leasehold premises can be sold as a going concern; whereas in the
facts of the present case, the buildings and plant and machinery have been removed
from the subject property which is now comprised of vacant lands, therefore, the said
notification would have no applicability to the facts of the present case.
- In the absence of a contract to the contrary, subletting of the subject property is
barred by sub-section (1) of section 15 of the Rent Act; sub-letting of any premises in
violation of section 15(1) of the Rent Act is unlawful under sub-section (1) of section
19 and is an offence punishable with imprisonment and fine under sub-section (2)
thereof. Therefore, in any event, the Official Liquidator cannot sublet or transfer the
tenancy rights in the subject property for a consideration as a condition of such
transfer of the tenancy rights of Jubilee Mills in the subject property.
- Since it is not permissible for the Official Liquidator to sublet or assign the leasehold land, any
direction issued by this court empowering the Official Liquidator to trans- fer the leasehold rights
for consideration and comply with the provisions of section 529 of 529A of the Companies Act would
be in violation of the provisions of sub-section (1) of section 15 and sub-section (1) of section 19 of
the Rent Act, which is also an offence under punishable un- der sub-section (2) of section 19.
- Since the Official Liquidator neither needs the subject property for efficiently carrying on
winding-up proceedings, nor is he in a position to sub-let or transfer the subject property for
consideration, as held by the Supreme Court in Rajendra Ishwardas Sethna v. Official Liquidator
(supra), the only course open to this court is to direct the Official Liquidator to surrender possession
of the subject property to the applicant and save recurring liability to pay rent.
100. In the light of above discussion, the applications succeed and are accordingly allowed to the
following extent. It is hereby ordered that the Official Liquidator of the Ahmedabad Jubilee
Spinning and Manufacturing Company Limited be deleted and in place thereof, the name of the
Official Liquidator of Ahmedabad Jubilee Mills Limited (in liquidation) be substituted. The Official
Liquidator is directed to hand over peaceful and vacant possession of the lands bearing Survey
No.53 admeasuring 4 acres 16 gunthas and Survey No.55 admeasuring 0 acres 16 gunthas of Village
Dariapur-Kazipur of Town Planning Scheme No.14 bearing Final Plot No.41, District and
Sub-District Ahmedabad to the applicant within a period of four months from the date of receipt of
a copy of this judgment. Insofar as the payment of arrears of rent is concerned, such amount has
already been paid during the pendency of these proceedings. Insofar as payment of monthly taxes,
mesne profit, etc. is concerned, the applicant may claim the same in the winding up proceedings.

101. On behalf of the Official Liquidator as well as Textile Labour Association, a request has been
made to stay the operation of this judgment for a period of ten weeks so as to enable them to
approach the higher forum. Since this court has directed the Official Liquidator to hand over the
possession of the subject land within a period of four months from the date of receipt of this
judgment, the above request is taken care of.
102. In the light of the above order, OJ Civil Applications No.2, 3 and 4 of 2016 also stand disposed
of.
