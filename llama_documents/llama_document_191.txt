[1]. Defendants are in second appeal against the concurrent judgments and decrees passed by the
Courts below.
[2]. Plaintiff-Wakf Dera Mahant Purshotam Dass Chela Mahant Sehdev Dass filed suit for
possession on the ground that Mahant Sehdev Dass Chela Mahant Ramji Dass owner of Wakf Dera
in terms of compromise between the parties, leased out the suit land for 99 years vide registered
lease deed No.3678 dated 23.09.1977. According to said lease deed, defendants lessee were to pay

Rs.10/- annually to the plaintiff as lease amount. Mahant Sehdev Dass died on 21.12.1991 and after
his death, Mahant Purshotam Dass became PRINCE SAINI Mahant of said Dera as per custom and
tradition of the plaintiff-Dera.
Mehant Purshotam Dass is managing affairs of the Dera in respect of immovable and movable
properties. Plaintiff alleged that defendants have violated the condition of lease deed and have made
themselves liable for dispossession and cancellation of lease deed. Plaintiff sought possession of the
land to be delivered to the plaintiff on the ground that defendants are not paying the lease money
regularly against the valid receipt. Defendant No.1 without any written consent of the plaintiff
subjected the land to sublet in respect of 8 kanals being 160/2105 share out of the land in favour of
defendant No.5 vide registered lease deed No.3333 dated 13.09.2000 on the basis of which mutation
No.2803 dated 17.10.2010 has been sanctioned. Plaintiff claimed that the mutation is not binding
upon the rights of the plaintiff and plaintiff- Dera is entitled to get possession of the land measuring
8 kanals comprised in Kila No.7 which has been illegally leased out in favour of defendant No.5.
Plaintiff also alleged that the suit land was leased out for agricultural purposes but the defendants
have illegally sub-letted and transferred the suit property and are changing the nature by
construction of houses and colonization and defendants are not paying any rent. Therefore,
defendants are liable to be evicted from the suit land by cancelling the lease. The suit came to be
filed with this back ground.
[3]. Defendants contested the suit by taking all customary pleas. Defendants alleged that Mahant
Purshotam Dass has no right or authority to file the suit, nor he has any locus standi and cause of
action to file the present suit. Plaintiff has not come to the Court with clean hands and has
suppressed the material facts. Civil court has no PRINCE SAINI jurisdiction to try the suit. The
defendant No.1 admitted that the suit land was given on lease for 99 years by previous Mahant
Sehdev Dass. Defendant No.2 alleged that plaintiff-Dera is the owner of suit land measuring 105
kanals 5 marlas as shown in the written statement and the said land was leased out to defendants
No.1 to 3 by registered lease deed dated 23.09.1977 upto 22.09.2076 and defendants No.1 to 3 were
put in possession of the land. Defendant No.2 is in possession to the extent of 2/3rd share and
defendant No.1 is in possession to the extent of 1/3rd share. Defendant No.1 had already transferred
lease rights in favour of defendant No.5 and his sons. Lease deed dated 23.09.1977 is claimed to be
legal and valid. Defendant No.5 alleged that Ramesh Kumar, Suresh Kumar, Vijay Kumar sons of
Hira Lal have not been impleaded as necessary parties and also admitted factum of lease deed
executed in favour of defendants No.1 to 3 and defendant No.1 being lessee to the extent of 1/3rd
share has transferred lease rights qua 8 kanals 10 marlas in favour of Ramesh Kumar, Suresh
Kumar, Vijay Kumar sons of defendant No.5 from 05.12.2002 to 22.09.2076 for a lease amount of
Rs.40,000/- through registered lease deed No.4780 dated 05.12.2002 and the possession of the
land was handed over to aforesaid Ramesh Kumar etc. Defendants alleged that they have not
violated the terms and conditions of the lease deed. Defendant No.1 has every right to transfer the
lease rights in respect of 8 kanals of land in favour of Ramesh Kumar etc. Defence of defendant No.1
was struck off on 07.09.2007 as he failed to file amended written statement. Replication was not
filed.
[4]. Parties went to trial on following issues:-

"1. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to decree for possession of the land measuring 105 kanal 5
marlas, detailed in the heading of the plaint as prayed for? OPP
2. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to decree for permanent injunction as consequential relief as
prayed for? OPP
3. Whether the suit has been filed through authorized competent person?OPD
4. Whether the suit of the plaintiff is not maintainable in the present form? OPD
5. Whether the plaintiff has no cause of action and locus standi to file and maintain the present suit?
OPD
6. Whether the suit has not been valued properly for the purpose of court fee and jurisdiction? OPD
7. Relief."
[5]. Parties led their respective evidence to prove their case. Trial Court decreed the suit vide
judgment and decree dated 29.04.2011. Only heirs of Hira Lal-defendant No.5 filed appeal before
the Lower Appellate Court which was dismissed vide judgment and decree dated 02.09.2014 passed
by Additional District Judge, Sirsa. That is why present appeal came to be filed.
[6]. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
[7]. Appellants have framed following substantial questions of law in the grounds of appeal:-
"(a) Whether the lease for a period of 99 years would get terminated with the afflux of
time in the absence of any express term or condition for termination of lease in the
lease deed?
(b) Whether sub-lease created during subsistence of original lease would get
automatically termination along with the original lease?
(c) Whether a Notice under Section 106 read with Section 111 of the Transfer of
Property Act was mandatory for termination of lease?
(d) Whether provisions of Sections 106 and 111 of the Transfer of Property Act are
applicable to the case in hand?
(e) Whether the suit was liable to be dismissed for non-
joinder of necessary parties?

(f) Whether the suit was liable to be dismissed as against appellants No.3 to 5 on the ground that the
Regd. Lease- Deed No.4780 dated 05.12.2002 created in their favour was never challenged in the
suit by the contesting respondent?
(g) Whether it is incumbent upon the Ld. First Appellate Court to discussed the relevant evidence
and record findings on all the contentious issues independently of the view taken by the Ld. Trial
Court?
(h) Whether the findings of the two courts below made on the basis of random observations and
without proper appreciation of the material evidence on record do not enjoy the sanctity of
concurrent findings which can be treated as immune to challenge and interference in the second
appeal?
[8]. Admittedly, plaintiff-Dera was the owner in possession of 105 kanals 5 marlas of land as
detailed in the plaint. Concededly the said land was leased out by the then Mehant Sehdev Dass vide
registered lease No.3678 dated 23.09.1977 for 99 years. The said land was leased out to defendants
on payment of Rs.10/- as annual lease amount but the defendants did not pay the same and have
violated the terms and conditions of the lease deed. On the other hand, defendants have denied that
the land was leased out on the basis of any lease money of Rs.10/- per annum. Perusal of lease deed
dated 23.09.1977 Ex.PW5/A reveals that 105 kanals 5 marlas of land comprised in sq. No.61 and 62
out of 120 kanals 5 marlas was given to defendants namely Ram Chand, Bhagwan Dass and Des Raj
sons of Sabu Ram in equal share for Rs.990/- for a period of 99 years from 23.09.1977 to
20.09.2076 and the said payment was fixed as Rs.10/- per annum against proper receipt.
[9]. Defendants could not demonstrate that no such condition was imposed upon them, rather, Des
Raj DW-3 has admitted in his cross examination that they did not pay any rent of the disputed land,
nor he could produce any receipt of payment of said annual amount of Rs.10/-. Defendant No.1
Bhagwan Dass had created sub lease of the land measuring 8 kanals 10 marlas out of his share to
defendant No.5 Hira Lal vide registered lease No.3333 dated 13.09.2000 for a lease money of
Rs.40,000/- for the period from 13.09.2000 to 20.09.2076. Perusal of this lease deed dated
13.09.2010 Ex.PW3/A and mutation Ex.PW4/A evidently proved that defendant No.1 had sub-letted
the land to defendant No.5. Hira Lal DW1 has also admitted this fact in his affidavit Ex.DW1/A that
defendant No.1 being lessee of 1/3rd share transferred the land measuring 8 kanals 10 marlas being
170/2105 share in favour of Ramesh Kumar, Suresh Kumar, Vijay Kumar who are his sons vide
registered lease deed No.4780 dated 05.12.2002 and defendant No.5 and his sons are in possession
of land measuring 8 PRINCE SAINI kanals 10 marlas on the spot. Defendant No.1 failed to appear in
the witness box to deny the fact that land was not given by him to defendant No.5 on lease. Defence
of defendant No.1 was struck off on 07.09.2007. Learned counsel for defendant No.1 argued that the
land was not given to defendant No.1 by the then Mahant Sehdev Dass on lease, rather it was a
compromise between the parties because whole of the land of plaintiff i.e. 120 kanals 5 marlas was
in possession of defendants No.1 to 3 and out of which they had returned about 15 kanals to Dera in
the said compromise. Even as per this contention, it cannot be observed in the absence of any
documentary evidence or compromise that any compromise was effected between the plaintiff and
defendants in respect of land of the plaintiff. In the lease deed dated 23.09.1977 Ex.PW5/A
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/174028658/ 4Hira Lal (Deceased) Th His Lrs Bhagan Bai ... vs Wakf Dera Mahant Purshottam Dass & Ors on 11 January, 2016
undoubtedly, it has been recited that plaintiff-Dera was owner of 120 kanals 5 marlas and
defendants namely Ram Chand, Bhagwan Dass and Des Raj were in cultivating possession of the
said land as 'Gair maurusian'. A compromise was effected between the parties in order to avoid
litigation and all the rights of defendants as tenants over the said land were dissolved and land
comprised in sq. No.61 and 62 as shown in the lease deed was given to them on lease for 99 years on
payment of Rs.10/- per annum. Defendants have not placed on record any receipt regarding
payment of said amount.
[10]. Perusal of Ex.PW6/B sale deed dated 06.01.1997 in respect of return of land i.e. 15 kanals to
the plaintiff on receipt of compensation of Rs.2000/- proved the aforesaid fact and this has been
admitted by the learned counsel for the defendants during course of arguments. The land which
remained on lease came out to be 105 PRINCE SAINI kanals 5 marlas. Defendant No.1 Bhagwan
Dass had sub-letted 8 kanals 10 marlas of his share to defendant No.5 without any consent of the
plaintiff. Under the lease deed, no right was given to the lessee to create further lease. Plaintiff never
ratified the conduct of lessee nor accepted the rent from sub-lessee.
[11]. During pendency of first appeal, Des Raj and Bhagwan Dass respondents No.2 and 3 therein
made statements to the effect that they have no concern with the suit property and they have denied
the possession as per decision of the trial Court dated 29.11.2011. They admitted that no consent of
co-owners was obtained while sub- letting the land. LRs of respondent No.4 Ram Chand namely Jai
Chand, Lekh Raj, Ramesh Kumar, Channo Bai and respondent No.5 Jammu Ram were already
proceeded against ex parte before the lower Appellate Court. The point for consideration between
LRs of Hira Lal and the plaintiff is that whether sub lease created by defendant No.1 out of his share
to the extent of 8 kanals 10 marlas in favour of defendant No.5 for a lease amount of Rs.40,000/-
vide registered lease No.4780 dated 05.12.2002 can be protected or not? Admittedly land measuring
105 kanals 5 marlas was leased out by the plaintiff-Wakf Dera to defendants No.1 to 3 for a period of
99 years for a lease amount of Rs.990 w.e.f 23.09.1977 to 22.09.2076. It was recited in the lease
deed that defendants would pay lease money of Rs.10/- per year to the plaintiff against proper
receipt. There would be no change in the amount of rent in terms of the lease deed. Section 111 of the
Transfer of Property Act deals with determination of lease. According to provision of Section 111 of
Transfer of Property Act, a lease of immovable property determines by certain modes i.e. by implied
PRINCE SAINI surrender and by forfeiture i.e in case the lessee breaks an express condition which
provides that, on breach thereof, the lessor may re- enter or in case lessee renounces his character as
such by setting up a title in a third person or by claiming title in himself. In view of Section 111(g) of
Transfer of Property Act for determination of lease by forfeiture, certain conditions must be fulfilled
i.e there must be an express condition in the lease deed which provides that in case of breach of said
condition, the lessor may re-enter and the lessee breaks such express condition, the lessor issues
notice in writing to the lessee of his intention to determine the lease.
[12]. Learned counsel for the appellants also relies upon Section 106 of Transfer of Property Act to
contend that notice in terms of Section 106 of Transfer of Property Act has been given to the lessee
for determination of lease and the lease cannot be determined in the absence of such clause in the
lease deed. On the strength of Section 91 and 92 of Evidence Act, learned counsel sought to argue
that the lessor has not given any notice of determination of lease nor there is any clause of forfeiture
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/174028658/ 5Hira Lal (Deceased) Th His Lrs Bhagan Bai ... vs Wakf Dera Mahant Purshottam Dass & Ors on 11 January, 2016
in the lease deed, therefore for violation of any condition of lease by the defendants no such
inference can be drawn on record. In nutshell, the argument is that a lease cannot be determined
unless and until there is a forfeiture clause. [13]. In view of facts on record, it has to be seen whether
admission made by defendants No.2 and 3 in favour of plaintiff binds defendants No.1 and 4 or not?
The admission made by a party may operate as an estoppel but not as a conclusive proof. Such an
admission may be relieved and binding upon other party if they have community in interest i.e.
common interest and was made prior to the controversy. Any such admission made during the
controversy may not be binding on the other party. Since defendants No.2 and 3 have made their
statements through their Advocate and have denied their possession, such admission does not bind
defendants No.1 and 4. The question arises for consideration is whether provisions of Transfer of
Property Act are applicable to agriculture lease or not? The contention of learned counsel for the
appellants based on Raja Mohammad Amir Ahlmad Khan Vs. Municipal Board of Sitapur and
another, AIR 1965 Supreme Court, 1923 (V 52 C 329) and Hotel Gudur represented by M.N.
Narayanana Vs. K.Radha Krishnaiah and others, AIR 1989, Supreme Court, 1510 are required to be
tested on the threshold of applicability of Section 117 of Transfer of Property Act. In Raja
Mohammad Amir Ahlmad Khan (supra) the Apex Court held that the principles embodied in
Section 111(g) are equally applicable to tenancies to which the Transfer of Property Act does not
apply, because they are in consonance with justice, equity and good conscience.
[14]. Apparently in view of Section 117 of Transfer of Property Act none of the provisions of this
Chapter apply to lease for agricultural purposes except insofar as State Government may by
notification published in the Official Gazette declare all or any of such provisions to be so applicable.
Such notification shall not take effect until the expiry of six months from the date of its publication.
No such notification has come on record from either side. Aforesaid judgments relate to non-
agriculture land. It is a settled principle of law that the Courts cannot add or subtract anything in the
expressed provisions of the statute in PRINCE SAINI the absence of any ambiguity. As such, the
Court has to interpret the law or provision as it is unless and until the ambiguity in the provision
requires the Court to interpret the law or the provision in such a way to advance real import statute
so as to prevent failure of justice and eschew that any such ambiguity may not defeat the purpose of
the statute. Court may apply golden rule of interpretation. Section 117 of Transfer of Property Act
envisages that none of the provision of this chapter apply to the agricultural purposes except in the
case of notification by the competent Government. Since no such notification has come forth on
record, therefore, in view of mandate of Constitution of India in terms of Article 141, the law
declared by the statute shall be binding upon the Courts. Since no notification of the Government in
the context of applicability of Transfer of Property Act has come on record, therefore, in the absence
of such notification, Section 117 of Transfer of Property Act would not apply to the lease of
agricultural land which are exempted from the provisions of the Act. Therefore, neither the
provisions of Section 106 nor of Section 111 of Transfer of Property Act are applicable to the instant
case, even otherwise only equitable principles of the provisions are applicable. Above all, subsequent
lessee has not taken the plea that he is a lessee in his own right and the plaintiff and other
defendants have included so as to ousting. [15]. The arguments raised by the learned counsel for the
appellants on the basis of Yashpal Lala Shiv Narain Vs. Allatala Tala Malik Waqf Ajakhan Mus,
2006(2) RCR (Civil) 712, M/s Amar Promoters, Bangalore and another Vs. J.S.A Gajendra Reddy
and others, 2005(3) RCR (Civil) 776, Braham Raj Singh Vs. Smt. Braham Raj Devi and others, 1982

AIR (H.P.) 57, Dharma Vs. Smt. PRINCE SAINI Harbai, 1976 PLJ 617, Ram Sarup Vs.
Commissioner, Ambala Division, 1991 PLJ 489 and Kusum Enterprises and others Vs. Vimal
Kochhar and another, 2014(3) CivCC 23 have no universal application on the facts of the present
case. In the instant case, the admission of Bhagwan Dass is claimed to be not binding upon the
appellants. The aforesaid contention of learned counsel for the appellants does not distract the
Court from noticing the fact that since there is no notification produced on record to make the
provisions of Section 106 and 111 of Transfer of Property Act applicable, therefore, in terms of
Section 117 of Transfer of Property Act the case does not fall under the extraction created therein in
the absence of any such notification produced on record. The principles initiated in Raja
Mohammad Amir Ahlmad Khan Vs. Municipal Board of Sitapur and another (supra) and Hotel
Gudur represented by M.N. Narayanana Vs. K.Radha Krishnaiah and others (supra) are not
applicable as question of applicability of Section 111 and its Sub- Clause does not arise at all. The
case remains simple violation of condition of lease deed in respect of agriculture land, therefore,
there cannot be any ratification of conduct of lessee in the absence of acceptance of land by the
plaintiff from sub lessee. Moreover, in lease deed, no right was given to the lessee to create sub lease.
[16]. In view of overall assessment of facts and circumstances of the case, this Court is of the
considered view that no indulgence can be given to the appellants on the basis of questions as
formulated in the grounds of appeal. Questions No.(a to d) are directly answered by the aforesaid
analogy in the context of no applicability of the provision in terms of Section 106 and 111 of Transfer
of Property Act for want of PRINCE SAINI notification on record. In terms of Section 117 of Transfer
of Property Act, question No.(e) does not arise at all because necessary parties to the lis were before
the Court. Moreover, issues No.3 to 6 were not pressed by the defendants before the trial Court.
Even no issue was claimed in respect of suit being bad on account of non-joinder of necessary
parties. Once there was no issue, nor any attack has been made in the grounds of appeal before the
lower Appellate Court, no such question can be treated to be substantial question of law at this
stage. Question No.(f) does not arise inasmuch as that the sub-lessee have no independent right to
retain the land, once there was no ratification of conduct of lessee, nor the land from the sub-lessee
was ever accepted by the plaintiff. Since the provisions of Transfer of Property Act have no
application, therefore, this question has to be answered in negative. Question No.(g) does not arise
inasmuch as that the judgment and decree passed by the Appellate Court is based on proper
appreciation of facts and evidence on record. Question No.(h) is a question of fact and both the
Courts below have decided the suit on proper appreciation of evidence. The judgments and decrees
passed by the Courts below cannot be held to be the result of misreading of evidence and having
suffered with any perversity. [17]. Having considered the arguments, this Court does not find any
substance in this appeal. Accordingly this appeal is dismissed.
