ABBOT INDIA LTD. ..... Appellant
Through: Mr. Sandeep Sethi, Sr. Adv. with Mr.
Darpan Wadhwa, Mr. Nakul Sachedev
& Ms. Saloni Chowdhry, Advs.
Versus
RAJINDER MOHINDRA & ANR. ..... Respondents
Through: Mr. Shankar Vaidialingum, Adv. for
R-1.
CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJIV SAHAI ENDLAW
RAJIV SAHAI ENDLAW, J.
1. The appeal impugns the judgment and decree (dated 21 st April, 2012 of the Court of the
Additional District Judge (ADJ) (Central)-12, Tis Hazari Courts, Delhi in CS No.39/2004 (Unique
Case ID No.02401C60492004) filed by the two respondents/plaintiffs against the
appellant/defendant) on admissions of ejectment of the appellant/defendant, after determination of
tenancy, from property No.E-44/10, Okhla Industrial Area, Phase-II, New Delhi-110020.
2. The appeal is accompanied with an application for condonation of 285 days delay in filing thereof.
Notice only of the application for condonation of delay was issued and the counsel for the
respondents/plaintiffs has filed reply thereto. On 11th July, 2013, while adjourning hearing on the
application on request of the counsel for the appellant/defendant, the counsels were asked to,
subject to the outcome of the application for condonation of delay, also come prepared for
arguments on the merits of the appeal. Since the enquiry into mesne profits/damages was then still
underway before the Trial Court and by requisitioning the Trial Court record the said enquiry would
have got stalled, on the statement of the counsel for the appellant/defendant that the copies of the
entire Trial Court record had been filed and giving liberty to the counsel for the
respondents/plaintiffs to file copies of any other document on Trial Court record, the matter was
adjourned.
3. On the next date i.e. 24th September, 2013, following order was passed:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/51153749/ 1Abbot India Ltd. vs Rajinder Mohindra & Anr. on 17 January, 2014
"1. This appeal is preferred against the judgment on admissions, of ejectment of the
appellant from the premises earlier in its tenancy.
2. The senior counsel for the appellant states that the appellant had also entered into
an agreement to purchase the tenancy premises and had filed a suit for specific
performance of the said agreement and which suit has been dismissed on merits;
however a first appeal, being RFA(OS) No.39/2011 against the said dismissal is
pending consideration and vide interim order dated 23rd March, 2011 confirmed on
5th October, 2011 therein, the appellant has been restrained from parting with
possession of the property without leave of the Court and the respondents have also
been restrained from creating third party interest in the property without leave of the
Court. He states that the same amounts to an order of status quo qua possession and
thus the hearing of the present appeal be adjourned awaiting the outcome of
RFA(OS) No.39/2011.
3. It has been enquired from the senior counsel for the appellant, whether in part
performance of the agreement to sell, the possession of the property was delivered to
the appellant.
4. The senior counsel for the appellant answers that the appellant, without prejudice
to its rights and contentions had continued to pay the rent after the agreement to sell
also.
5. The aforesaid is indicative of the tenancy having continued and the agreement of
sale being distinct from the agreement of tenancy.
6. In that view of the matter, in my view, the outcome of the present appeal is not
dependent upon the outcome of the appeal preferred against the dismissal of the suit
for specific performance. I have recently in Sunil Kapoor Vs. Himmat Singh 167
(2010) DLT 806 had an occasion to discuss in detail the said aspect and where it has
been held that the ejectment in such cases cannot await the decision in a claim for
specific performance of an agreement of sale of the property.
7. As far as the contention of the senior counsel for the appellant, of the interim
orders in RFA(OS) No.39/2011 is concerned, the same in my view, do not come in the
way of ejectment in accordance with law of the appellant as a tenant from the
property. The appellant if successful in the claim for specific performance, would be
entitled to possession in accordance therewith.
8. It has thus been informed that the appellant can continue in possession only if it
arrives at mutually acceptable terms with the respondents of payment of market rent
till the decision of the claim for specific performance.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/51153749/ 2Abbot India Ltd. vs Rajinder Mohindra & Anr. on 17 January, 2014
9. The senior counsel for the appellant at this stage states that the matter be
adjourned by two weeks to enable the appellant to obtain clarification from the Bench
before which RFA(OS) No.39/2011 is listed.
10. Though the counsel for the respondents opposes but it is deemed appropriate to
give such opportunity to the appellant.
11. It may be noted that the aforesaid is without prejudice to the application of the
appellant for condonation of 285 days delay in filing the appeal and also without
prejudice to other arguments which may be addressed by the appellant against the
order of ejectment.
12. List on 22nd October, 2013."
4. On 22nd October, 2013, the senior counsel for the appellant/defendant stated that the
appellant/defendant had decided not to obtain clarification from the Bench before which RFA(OS)
No.39/2011 is pending and the appellant/defendant wanted to press the appeal. In the
circumstances, the senior counsel for the appellant/defendant as well as the counsel for the
respondents/plaintiffs, were heard on the application for condonation of delay as well as on the
merits of the appeal and judgment reserved.
5. The respondents/plaintiffs instituted the suit from which this appeal arises, pleading:
(i) that the respondents/plaintiffs are the owners of the property aforesaid;
(ii) that the appellant/defendant was inducted as a tenant in the said property vide
registered Lease Deed dated 8th April, 1986 which had expired by efflux of time on
31st March, 2001;
(iii) that the tenancy of the appellant/defendant had also been terminated vide notice
dated 7th March, 2001 duly served on the appellant/defendant;
(iv) that the appellant/defendant was thus in unauthorized use and occupation of the
premises;
(v) that the appellant/defendant was last paying rent to the respondents/plaintiffs of
Rs.32,199/- per month besides Rs.5,367/- per month towards hire charges of fittings
and fixtures provided in the premises;
(vi) that both the respondents/plaintiffs were settled in United States of America
(USA) and in the year 1987 acquired citizenship of USA and on making enquiries
from the Reserve Bank of India were informed that they were violating the Foreign
Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 and were bound to dispose of the property to an
Indian citizen;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/51153749/ 3Abbot India Ltd. vs Rajinder Mohindra & Anr. on 17 January, 2014
(vii) that the appellant/defendant offered to purchase the property and an Agreement
dated 20th November, 1989 of sale of property by the respondents/plaintiffs to the
appellant/defendant was executed;
(viii) that the respondents/plaintiffs (for the reasons which is not necessary to
burden this judgment with) opted to exit from the said Agreement to Sell and vide
their letter dated 28 th December, 1993 to the appellant/defendant cancelled the
Agreement to Sell and returned the sum of Rs.3 lakhs received from the
appellant/defendant;
(ix) that the appellant/defendant filed a suit for specific performance of the said
Agreement to Sell and by an interim order in the said suit, the parties were directed
to maintain status quo qua possession and title and the appellant/defendant was
directed to continue to pay the admitted amount of rent to the
respondents/plaintiffs; the said suit was pending at the time of institution of the suit
(in or about October, 2001) from which this appeal arises;
(x) that the pendency of the suit for specific performance of the
Agreement to Sell did not come in the way of the
respondents/plaintiffs seeking ejectment of the appellant/defendant from the
premises as a tenant as the appellant/defendant admittedly continued as a lessee till
the expiry on 31st March, 2001 of the Lease Deed dated 8th April, 1986;
(xi) that though the tenancy of the appellant/defendant had expired by efflux of time
but by way of abundant caution, a notice dated 7th March, 2001 of determination of
tenancy had also been served on the appellant/defendant.
Accordingly, the suit for the reliefs of ejectment after determination of tenancy of the
appellant/defendant and for recovery of mesne profits/damages for use and occupation of the
premises was filed.
6. The appellant/defendant contested the suit by filing a written statement, on the grounds:
(a) "that the defendant herein is in possession of the suit property by virtue of an
indenture of lease dated 8.11.1986 whereby the plaintiff gave to the defendant the
property in question on the terms and conditions contained in the indenture of
lease.";
(b) that though the appellant/defendant as per the Agreement to Sell, had under
cover of its letter dated 9th June, 1993 forwarded a sum of Rs.3 lakhs vide demand
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/51153749/ 4Abbot India Ltd. vs Rajinder Mohindra & Anr. on 17 January, 2014
draft to the respondents/plaintiffs as earnest money but the respondents/plaintiffs
unilaterally and illegally terminated the Agreement and returned the said demand
draft;
(c) that the appellant/defendant was entitled to specific performance of the
Agreement to Sell;
(d) that the suit for ejectment had been filed as a counterblast to the suit for specific
performance filed by the appellant/defendant;
(e) that the Lease Deed dated 8th April, 1986 had not expired by efflux of time and
the appellant/defendant was not in unauthorized occupation;
(f) that the appellant/defendant vide its letters dated 7 th April, 2001, 27th June,
2001 and 7th August, 2001 had called upon the respondents/plaintiffs to renew the
lease in terms of Clause 3 thereof;
(g) "it is submitted that the defendant is in possession of the suit property by virtue of
the specific terms and conditions of the registered Lease Deed dated 8.4.1986 and
thereafter by virtue of the Court orders passed in Suit No.705/1994 filed by the
defendant herein."
(h) that the request of the appellant/defendant for extension of the lease had been
rejected by the respondents/plaintiffs without giving any reasons whatsoever;
(i) that as per the terms and conditions of the Hire Agreement dated 8th April, 1986
also, the right of the appellant/defendant as lessee to continue to occupy the premises
even after 15 years and to extension of the lease was made out;
(j) "In terms of Clause 3 of the Lease Deed dated 8 th April, 1986, the defendant
sought extension of the Lease for a further period of 5 years on an increased rent of
25% and thereafter for further periods of 5 years each as provided therein. This is
without prejudice to the contention of the defendant that they are entitled to remain
in use and occupation of the suit premises in terms of the Agreement for Sale dated
20th November, 1989 and in terms of the order dated 25th March, 1994 in Suit
No.705/1994.";
(k) that the action of the respondents/plaintiffs of refusing to extend the lease and to execute a fresh
lease deed without giving any reasons for the same, is in flagrant violation of Clause 3 of the Lease
Deed.
7. Though the respondents/plaintiffs filed replication to the written statement aforesaid but need is
not felt to advert thereto.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/51153749/ 5Abbot India Ltd. vs Rajinder Mohindra & Anr. on 17 January, 2014
8. In the aforesaid state of affairs, the respondents/plaintiffs applied under Order XII Rule 6 of the
Civil Procedure Code (CPC), 1908 for a decree for ejectment on admissions and which application
has been allowed by the learned ADJ vide the impugned judgment and decree,
finding/observing/holding:
(I) that in a suit seeking relief of possession on the basis of termination of tenancy,
the Court has to look into three aspects:
(i) Whether the relationship of landlord and tenant is admitted;
(ii) Whether the rent was above Rs.3,500/- or not;
(iii) Whether the lease has been terminated by serving a notice
or not.
If the answer to all the above factors is in affirmative, the Court has to venture into an
enquiry if the defences raised by the defendant have any bearing upon the above
factors;
(II) that there is categorical admission of the appellant/defendant that its entry into
the premises in question was as a lessee; (III) that there was nothing to suggest that
the nature of possession had ever changed despite the execution of an Agreement to
Sell; (IV) that the possession of the appellant/defendant of the premises continued to
be as a lessee as was evident from letters dated 7 th April, 2001, 27th June, 2001 and
7th August, 2001 of the appellant/defendant seeking extension/renewal of the lease,
the term whereof had expired on 31st March, 2001;
(V) that there was nothing on record to indicate that possession of the property was
handed over to the appellant/defendant pursuant to the Agreement of Sale and
Purchase;
(VI) that thus the relationship of landlord and tenant subsisted between the parties;
(VII) that it was also not in dispute that the last rent paid by the appellant/defendant
to the respondents/plaintiffs was of Rs.32,199/-
per month besides hire charges; thus the premises were outside the ambit of the Delhi Rent Control
Act, 1958;
(VIII) that the appellant/defendant in admission/denial of documents had admitted the notice of
termination, though denied the contents thereof; similarly the AD Cards filed by the
respondents/plaintiffs to show service of the said notice had also been admitted; thus, there was an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/51153749/ 6Abbot India Ltd. vs Rajinder Mohindra & Anr. on 17 January, 2014
admission of receipt of notice of determination of tenancy; (IX) that even otherwise, as per the dicta
of this Court in Jeevan Diesels & Electricals Ltd. Vs. Jasbir Singh Chadha (HUF) 183 (2011) DLT
712, service of summons of a suit for ejectment amounted to termination of tenancy;
(X) that the appellant/defendant even otherwise vide letters dated 7th April, 2001, 27th June, 2001
and 7th August, 2001 had admitted expiry of the Lease on 31st March, 2001; in view thereof, notice
of termination of tenancy was not necessitated;
(XI) that the doctrine of part performance did not come to the aid of the appellant/defendant.
Accordingly, finding the appellant/defendant to have admitted the relationship of landlord and
tenant, the premises being outside the ambit of the Rent Act and determination of tenancy, a decree
for ejectment on admissions, has been passed.
9. The senior counsel for the appellant has argued:
(aa) that the appellant / defendant in the written statement had pleaded agreement
for purchase of the property and that the appellant / defendant is entitled to remain
in use and occupation of the premises in terms of the said Agreement of Sale;
(bb) that the appellant / defendant being an agreement purchaser of immovable
property cannot under Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 be ejected
therefrom;
(cc) that the learned ADJ in the impugned order has not recorded that the appellant /
defendant has made an admission that it is not liable to the protection under said
Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882;
(dd) that the appellant / defendant though in the written statement filed had not
expressly taken a defence of Section 53A of Transfer of Property Act but had applied
for amendment of the written statement to take the said plea and which application
for amendment of the written statement was dismissed by the Trial Court vide order
dated 27.07.2007; that the appellant / defendant had preferred CM (M)
No.1418/2007 to this Court against the said order and which was disposed of vide
order dated 26.11.2008 observing that the "preliminary objection sought to be
introduced is purely legal in nature. It is settled law that in pleadings parties are not
required to plead law and evidence. Parties are only required to plead facts affecting
their case. The law can be pleaded at the final stage when the arguments are
heard............ At the final stage when evidence has been led, both the parties are at
liberty to plead before the Court all legal issues and factual matrix of the case.
Learned Trial Court at the time of deciding this case, shall not be prejudiced by any
interim order passed earlier and the decision shall be given on merits of the case.";
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/51153749/ 7Abbot India Ltd. vs Rajinder Mohindra & Anr. on 17 January, 2014
(ee) that according to the aforesaid order of this Court, evidence was required to be
recorded in the suit and the appellant / defendant after recording of evidence was
entitled to argue the defence of Section 53A of the Act and the learned ADJ in the
impugned order has failed to notice the said direction of this Court;
(ff) that in the order dated 22.02.1993 in Civil Writ No.310/1990 of this Court,
challenging the order of the Appropriate Authority under the Income Tax Act, 1961 of
compulsory purchase of the said property in exercise of powers under the then
Chapter XXC of the Income Tax Act, it is recorded "The petitioner was a lessee of the
premises, which were later on purchased by it from the landlord.......Moreover the
purchaser as an erstwhile lessee for a long period of 15 years. This matter is also to be
kept in view while passing an order of acquisition. Therefore, it is a case in which the
Appropriate Authority has to pass a fresh order and to decide whether it is subject to
encumbrances or not."; that the respondents / plaintiffs were the parties to the said
writ petition and from the said order it is evident that the appellant / defendant in
the said proceedings was referred to as „ex-lessee(cid:129) of the premises, meaning that the
possession then of the appellant / defendant was not as a lessee but as a purchaser;
(gg) that the letters dated 07.04.2001 and 27.06.2001 of the appellant / defendant to
the respondents / plaintiffs for renewal of lease and which the learned ADJ in the
impugned order has considered to be clinching evidence to negate the applicability of
Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act were "without prejudice to the rights and
contentions that the appellant / defendant was entitled to remain in use and
occupation of the premises pursuant to the Agreement to Sell(cid:129) as expressly stated in
both the letters";
(hh) that the authorized representative of the appellant / defendant in the statement
under Order 10 of the CPC recorded by the learned ADJ on 23.04.2010 and on
06.07.2010 had also stated that the appellant / defendant after the Agreement to Sell
remained in the property as a tenant purchaser under the Agreement to Sell;
(ii) that the appellant / defendant after the institution of the suit for specific
performance, was paying rent to the respondents / plaintiffs in accordance with the
condition imposed on the appellant / defendant by the Court while granting the
interim order of status quo to be maintained, to continue to pay the admitted amount
of rent to the respondents / plaintiffs till further orders and the said order was
without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the appellant / defendant and thus
the mere fact of the appellant / defendant having continued to pay the rent cannot be
construed as an admission on the part of the appellant / defendant of continuing as a
lessee and not as an agreement purchaser in possession of the property; (jj) that thus
there were questions arising for adjudication in the suit on which there were no
admissions of the appellant / defendant;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/51153749/ 8Abbot India Ltd. vs Rajinder Mohindra & Anr. on 17 January, 2014
(kk) that as per the dicta in Jeevan Diesels & Electricals Ltd. Vs. Jasbir Singh Chadha
(Huf) (2010) 6 SCC 601, the admissions have to be clear and to be such as would
show that the plaintiff is clearly entitled to the relief asked for and Order 12 Rule 6
does not apply when there is a serious question of law to be argued;
(ll) that as per the dicta in Ram Kumar Agrawal Vs. Thawar Das (1999) 7 SCC 303 a plea under
Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act is a mixed question of law and fact and there being no
clear admission of the appellant / defendant of Section 53A of the Act being not applicable, no order
of ejectment under Order 12 Rule 6 of the CPC could have been passed;
(mm) that the defence of Section 53A against dispossession is available even after dismissal of a suit
for specific performance as held in Balasaheb Manikrao Deshmukh Vs. Rama Lingoji Warthi AIR
2000 Bom 337;
(nn) that the judgment of dismissal of the suit for specific performance of the Agreement of Sale of
immovable property (and which judgment is under appeal) though holds the appellant / defendant
to have been ready and willing to perform its part of the Agreement to Sell has denied the appellant
/ defendant the relief of specific performance in exercise of discretion implicit in the grant of relief
of specific performance and holding the Agreement to Sell to be terminable;
(oo) that the learned ADJ for denying the benefit of Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act has
considered only the three letters dated 07.04.2001, 27.06.2001 and 07.08.2001 and none of the
other material available on record;
(pp) that the finding of the learned ADJ that there are clear, specific, unambiguous and unequivocal
admissions is contrary to the written statement of the appellant / defendant.
10. Per contra, the counsel for the respondents / plaintiffs has argued:
(i) that there was no pleading of the appellant / defendant being in possession of the
premises in part performance of the Agreement to Sell, in the written statement of
the appellant / defendant;
(ii) that this is evident from the application filed by the appellant / defendant for
amendment of the written statement and which application was dismissed;
(iii) that none of the observations in the order dated 27.07.2007 in CM(M)
No.1418/2007 preferred by the appellant / defendant against the dismissal of the
application for amendment can be relied upon as the CM(M) petition was ultimately
dismissed;
(iv) that there is no plea in the plaint in the suit for specific performance filed by the
appellant / defendant also of the appellant / defendant being in possession of the
property in part performance of the Agreement to Sell;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/51153749/ 9Abbot India Ltd. vs Rajinder Mohindra & Anr. on 17 January, 2014
(v) that the appellant / defendant has nowhere pleaded that its possession of the
premises, admittedly initially as a lessee, changed to that as of a purchaser;
(vi) that the appellant / defendant in its written statement in the suit from which this
appeal arises had clearly admitted being in possession of the property as lessee;
(vii) that there is long delay of 285 days in preferring the appeal and there is no cause
least sufficient cause for condonation thereof;
(viii) that the reason given for condonation of said delay, of pendency of review
before the learned ADJ, is no reason as there is no affidavit of any advocate who may
have advised the appellant / defendant of there being good ground for review.
11. The senior counsel for the appellant / defendant in rejoinder has argued that review of the
impugned judgment was sought before the learned ADJ on the ground of the learned ADJ having
not taken note of the plea of the appellant / defendant of Section 53A of the Transfer of Property
Act, 1882 and notice of the review application was issued which remained pending and the
pendency of the review is sufficient ground for condonation of delay in preferring the appeal.
12. I have considered the rival contentions.
13. As would be evident from the aforesaid, the senior counsel for the appellant / defendant has not
challenged insofar as the learned ADJ finds no factual adjudication to be required on the aspect of
existence of relationship of landlord and tenant, the premises being outside the purview of the Rent
Act and determination of tenancy (I may notice that the judgment of this Court in Jeevan Diesels &
Electricals Ltd. supra relied upon by the learned ADJ for the principle of determination of tenancy
by service of summons of a suit for ejectment and expiry of 15 days therefrom was indeed based on
the dicta of the Supreme Court in Nopany Invetsments (P) Ltd. Vs. Santokh Singh (HUF) (2008) 2
SCC 728)
14. The only questions thus for determination are:
(i) Whether the appellant / defendant had taken a plea of Section 53A of the Transfer
of Property Act;
(ii) The effect of the order dated 27.07.2007 in CM(M) No.1418/2007 supra preferred
by the appellant / defendant;
(iii) if the plea of Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act is found to have been
taken by or available to the appellant / defendant, whether the adjudication of the
said plea requires any trial.
15. I have examined the record from the aforesaid perspective.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/51153749/ 10Abbot India Ltd. vs Rajinder Mohindra & Anr. on 17 January, 2014
16. The Agreement to Sell dated 20.11.1989 which is an admitted document, records:
(A) that the appellant / defendant was a lessee under the respondents / plaintiffs in
the property;
(B) the agreement of the respondents / plaintiffs to sell the property to the appellant
/ defendant after obtaining the requisite permissions;
(C) the agreement of the parties for payment by the appellant / defendant to the
respondents / plaintiffs of a sum of Rs.3,00,000/- as earnest money within a week of
the respondents / plaintiffs obtaining the necessary permission from the RBI;
(D) the agreement of the respondents / plaintiffs to after receipt of other approvals /
permissions, execute a Deed of Conveyance / Assignment in favour of the appellant /
defendant, presenting the same for registration with the registering authority and
"handing over possession of the said premises" to the appellant / defendant and
provides that upon such completion, appellant / defendant shall pay to the
respondents / plaintiffs the balance consideration after adjusting the earnest money;
(E) that the respondents / plaintiffs shall refund the deposit of Rs.2,15,000/- placed
by the appellant / defendant with the respondents / plaintiffs pursuant to the Lease
Agreement dated 08.04.1986 simultaneously upon receipt of balance sale
consideration.
17. Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act provides that where any person contracts to transfer
for consideration any immoveable property by writing signed by him or on his behalf from which the
terms necessary to constitute the transfer can be ascertained with reasonable certainty and the
transferee has in part performance of the contract taken possession of the property or any part
thereof or the transferee being already in possession continues in possession in part performance of
the contract and has done some act in furtherance of the contract and the transferee has performed
or is willing to perform his part of the contract then notwithstanding that the transfer has not been
completed in the manner prescribed therefor by the law, the transferor shall be debarred from
enforcing against the transferee any right in respect of the property of which the transferee has
taken or continued in possession other than a right expressly provided by the terms of the contract.
It is thus evident that for Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act to be invoked, the transferee
should have in part performance of the contract of transfer taken possession of the property or if
already in possession of the property should after the contract of transfer continue in possession in
part performance of the contract of transfer. Section 53A cannot be invoked wherever there is an
agreement of sale of immovable property, unless possession of the property has been
taken/delivered in part performance of agreement to sell.
18. The appellant / defendant was at the time of Agreement to Sell already in possession of the
property as a tenant. What has to be determined is whether the appellant / defendant under the
Agreement to Sell was entitled to thereafter continue in possession in part performance of the said
Agreement to Sell i.e. as a purchaser in possession or the possession of the appellant / defendant
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/51153749/ 11Abbot India Ltd. vs Rajinder Mohindra & Anr. on 17 January, 2014
even after the Agreement to Sell was to be that of a lessee / tenant only. As would be evident from
above, there is no clause in the Agreement to Sell though formally drafted, indicating that the nature
and character of the possession of the appellant / defendant of the property was to change after the
Agreement to Sell or delivering possession of the property to the appellant / defendant in pursuance
thereto or to the effect that the possession of the appellant / defendant of the property after the
Agreement to Sell was to be as an agreement purchaser and not as a lessee / tenant as prior thereto.
On the contrary, the agreement expressly provids that the respondents / plaintiffs were to handover
possession of the property to the appellant / defendant at the time of execution of the sale deed. If
the intent of the parties was for the possession of the property to be delivered to the appellant /
defendant in part performance of the Agreement to Sell, at the time of execution thereof, there
would have been no occasion for the agreement to provide for handing over of possession of the
property at the time of execution of the sale deed. Not only so, the Agreement to Sell provided for
refund by the respondents / plaintiffs to the appellant / defendant of the security deposit made by
the appellant / defendant with the respondents / defendants as per the lease deed only against
receipt of balance sale consideration. Again, had the intent of the parties been to determine the
relationship of lease deed at the time of execution of the Agreement to Sell, there was no occasion
for providing for refund of the security deposit paid under the lease deed only at the time of
execution of the sale deed.
19. Also, there is no clause in the Agreement to Sell that the payment of rent by the appellant /
defendant to the respondents / plaintiffs under the Lease Deed would cease after the signing of the
Agreement to Sell. There is no such plea also of the appellant / defendant that it stopped payment of
rent on the signing of the Agreement to Sell. On the contrary, it is the express plea of the
respondents / plaintiffs in the plaint in the suit from which this appeal arises and which is not
controverted in the written statement that the appellant / defendant after the Agreement to Sell
dated 20.11.1989, on expiry of the first five years of lease on 31.03.1991 exercised option for renewal
of the lease and increased the rent and hire charges by 25% and upon expiry of another five years on
31.03.1996 again exercised the option of renewal of lease and further increased the rent by 25%. If
the relationship of landlord and tenant under the Lease Deed had come to an end upon the signing
of the Agreement to Sell, there would have been no occasion for the appellant / defendant to
exercise the option of renewal of the lease. It has thus but to be held that the Agreement to Sell does
not provide for the appellant / defendant as purchaser, either being delivered possession of the
property in part performance of the Agreement to Sell or being already in possession as a lessee,
continuing in possession thereof thereafter in part performance of the Agreement to Sell.
20. Section 91 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1972 provides that when the terms of a contract or any
other disposition of property have been reduced to the form of a document and in all cases in which
any matter is required by law to be reduced in the form of a document, no evidence in proof of the
terms of such contract, grant or disposition of property except the document itself shall be given.
Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act is available only where the Agreement to Sell is in
writing. Thus the present is a case where for a plea of Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act to
be available, the Agreement to Sell is required by law to be in writing. Reception of any other
evidence of such Agreement to Sell in writing except the document itself is prohibited and no
adjudication is thus required. The Agreement to Sell is admitted and does not require any trial to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/51153749/ 12Abbot India Ltd. vs Rajinder Mohindra & Anr. on 17 January, 2014
interpret the terms thereof.
21. Thus, on a reading of the terms of the Agreement to Sell, no plea of Section 53A of the Transfer
of Property Act is found to be available to the appellant / defendant for the reason of the same not
providing for delivery of possession of the property to the appellant / defendant in part performance
of the Agreement to Sell or of the appellant / defendant being already in possession as lessee, after
the Agreement to Sell, continuing in possession in part performance of the Agreement to Sell.
22. The appellant / defendant by its admissions in response to paras No.11&12 of the plaint, of
renewal of lease with effect from 01.04.1991 and thereafter with effect from 01.04.1996 has also
admitted the case of the respondents / plaintiffs of continuing in possession of the property after the
Agreement to Sell also as a lessee and not in part performance of the Agreement to Sell. The
appellant / defendant has also admitted continuing payment of rent and increased rent on each
renewal, after the Agreement to Sell. Had the relationship of landlord and tenant come to an end
and the possession after the Agreement to Sell of the appellant / defendant been as an agreement
purchaser in part performance, there would have been no question of the appellant / defendant
paying any rent. Not only so, the respondents / plaintiffs have also pleaded the letters dated 7th
April, 2001, 27th June, 2001 and 7th August, 2001 being written by the appellant / defendant for
renewal of lease and the appellant / defendant in the written statement has admitted the same.
Though undoubtedly in the said letters, it is the case of the appellant / defendant that further
renewal of lease was without prejudice to its right to continue in possession under the Agreement to
Sell but the question of continuing in possession under the Agreement to Sell would arise only if the
appellant / defendant in pursuance to the Agreement to Sell been delivered possession or continued
in possession in part performance of the Agreement to Sell and not otherwise.
23. The appellant / defendant instituted the suit for specific performance in or about March, 1994
i.e. long prior to the suit from which this appeal arises and after availing of the first renewal of the
lease in 1991 i.e. after the Agreement to Sell. During the hearing, I enquired from the senior counsel
for the appellant / defendant whether the appellant / defendant in the plaint in the said suit for
specific performance took the plea of being in possession of the property in part performance of the
Agreement to Sell. Though the senior counsel for the appellant / defendant invited attention to the
said plaint but could not point out therefrom any such plea. Rather, the specific performance of the
Agreement to Sell, which provides for delivery of possession at the time of execution and
registration of the Sale Deed, was sought. Thus, it has but to be held that the appellant / defendant,
in the plaint in the suit for specific performance also impliedly admitted that it was not in possession
of the property in part performance of the Agreement to Sell.
24. As far as the reliance by the senior counsel for the appellant / defendant on the interim order in
the said suit for specific performance, making the order of status quo regarding possession and title
subject to payment of admitted amounts by the appellant / defendant is concerned, in the face of the
appellant / defendant in the plaint in that case having not set up a case of being not liable to pay rent
as lessee and in fact from the factum of, from the date of the Agreement to Sell till the filing of the
suit for specific performance continuing to pay the rent, it cannot be said that the payment of rent
thereafter is only owing to a direction of the Court and not owing to the liability otherwise of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/51153749/ 13Abbot India Ltd. vs Rajinder Mohindra & Anr. on 17 January, 2014
appellant / defendant under the Lease Deed. Not only so, after the institution of the said suit for
specific performance also, renewal of lease which was not subject matter of that suit was availed of
and it was not the case of the appellant / defendant that the same was in pursuance of any order in
the suit for specific performance.
25. That takes me to the aspect of effect of the order dated 27.07.2007 in CM(M) No.1418/2007
supra. In the written statement as originally filed in the suit for ejectment from which this appeal
arises, again there is no plea of appellant / defendant having been delivered possession of the
property in part performance of the Agreement to Sell or continuing in possession of the property in
part performance of the Agreement to Sell. The Division Benches of this Court in Kanhya Lal Vs.
Birdhi Chand Girdhari Lal MANU/DE/0333/1972 and in State Bank of India Vs. Pushpa Arora 64
(1996) DLT 557 have held that a plea of part performance which necessarily involves questions of
fact cannot be permitted to be raised in appeal, when it was not taken in the written statement in the
Trial Court though when a defendant in the written statement states all the essential facts without
stating the effect of those facts, the benefit of Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act cannot be
denied to him merely on the ground that there is no specific mention of Section 53A of the Transfer
of Property Act. The Supreme Court also in Williams Vs. Lourdusamy (2008) 5 SCC 647 held that it
is one thing to say that a person is in possession of the property and it is another thing to say that he
has a right to possess pursuant to or in furtherance of an agreement for sale and that for application
of Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, requisite ingredients must be pleaded.
26. The filing of the application by the appellant / defendant for amendment of the written
statement to take the plea of Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act is also an admission of the
said plea being non existent in the written statement as originally filed. The said application for
amendment was dismissed by the learned ADJ and though the appellant / defendant preferred the
CM(M) No.1418/2007 supra but the end result thereof was also of dismissal. Undoubtedly, this
Court while dismissing the CM(M) No.1418/2007 observed that the said plea would be available to
the appellant / defendant if established. The said observations appear to have come to be made in
the light of the dictas aforesaid of the Division Benches of this Court laying down that even without
naming Section 53A, if the necessary ingredients thereof are pleaded, the said plea would be
available. However the appellant / defendant in the present case has not only not pleaded the
necessary ingredients of Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act but as aforesaid admitted other
facts which run counter to the possession of the premises having been delivered to the appellant /
defendant in part performance of the Agreement to Sell.
27. I am unable to accept that a stray observation made by this Court in the said order in the CM(M)
petition while ultimately dismissing the said CM(M) petition would confer a right on the appellant /
defendant to lead evidence when there is no plea in the pleadings on which the evidence is sought to
be led. Apart from the fact that a party cannot be permitted to lead evidence on an aspect for which
no foundation has been laid in the pleadings (see Bachhaj Nahar Vs. Nilima Mandal (2008) 17 SCC
491), it is pertinent to note that even this Court while dismissing the CM(M) petition of the appellant
/ defendant was of the view that the issue sought to be raised was „purely legal in nature(cid:129). It was in
this light, that the contention under Section 53A was made available to the appellant / defendant at
the time of final arguments. The appellant / defendant cannot thus, on the one hand rely on the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/51153749/ 14Abbot India Ltd. vs Rajinder Mohindra & Anr. on 17 January, 2014
aforesaid order to contend that such a plea is available to it, and on the other hand, argue that part
performance being a mixed question of law and fact, it be permitted to lead evidence and no
judgment on admissions should be passed.
28. The same is the position with respect to the observations in the order dated 22.02.1993 in CW
No.301/1990. This Court in the said proceeding was not concerned with the question whether the
lease had come to an end or not. All that this Court was concerned with was of the property agreed
to be sold to being encumbered by way of a tenancy in favour of the purchaser itself. Thus, merely
because the order records the appellant / defendant as an „erstwhile lessee(cid:129) cannot change the
agreement between the parties. Moreover, even after that order as aforesaid, the appellant /
defendant continued to deal with the property as a tenant by paying rent thereof and by availing of
renewal thereof.
29. Undoubtedly, the plea under Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act is a mixed question of
law and fact but the question of adjudication of such question of fact by giving an opportunity to
lead evidence arises only when the plea is taken or the ingredients thereof pleaded and which is not
the case in the present case. A mere plea of having agreed to purchase the property does not
tantamount to taking the plea under Section 53A.
30. The Supreme Court in D.S. Parvathamma Vs. A. Srinivasan (2003) 4 SCC 705 was concerned
with whether the appellant in that case was entitled to protect his possession under Section 53A and
hence not liable to suffer eviction based on landlord-tenant relationship which had ceased to exist
on account of subsequent events. It was held that one of the essential features of the equitable
doctrine of part performance as statutorily modified and incorporated in Section 53A is that the
transferee has, in part performance of the contract, taken possession of the property or any part
thereof, or the transferee being already in possession, continues in possession in part performance
of the contract and has done some act in furtherance of the contract. It was further held that since
the appellant had failed to allege that he was delivered possession in part performance of the
contract or having already been in possession as lessee, continued in possession in part performance
of the agreement to purchase i.e. by mutual agreement between the parties, his possession as lessee
ceased and commenced as that of a transferee under the contract and further since the appellant
inspite of entering into a contract of purchase had not disowned his character as lessee and was
treated as such by the parties, the defence of Section 53A was not available to him. It was yet yet
further held that when a person already in possession of the property in some other capacity enters
into a contract to purchase the property, to confer the benefit of protecting possession under the
plea of part performance, his act effective from that day must be consistent with the contract alleged
and also such as cannot be referred to the preceding title. The Supreme Court further held that the
appellant having entered into possession as a tenant and having continued to remain in possession
in that capacity, cannot be heard to say that by reason of agreement to sell his possession was not
that of a tenant.
31. The procedure prescribed in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 for disposal of suits provides for
issues to be framed only on material propositions of law or fact which a plaintiff must allege in order
to show a right to sue or a defendant must allege in order to constitute his defence. Else, Order 15
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/51153749/ 15Abbot India Ltd. vs Rajinder Mohindra & Anr. on 17 January, 2014
provides that where the parties are not found at issue on any question of law or fact, the Court
should at once pronounce judgment. Once it is found that there is no defence as alleged of Section
53A of the Transfer of Property Act, merely because a bogey thereof is raised at the stage of framing
of the issues or upon the respondents / plaintiffs filing an application for decree on admissions,
would not call for framing of an issue. It has been held in T. Arivandandam Vs. T.V. Satyapal AIR
1977 SC 2421, Liverpool & London S.P. & I Association Vs. M.V. Sea Success I (2004) 9 SCC 512 and
ITC Ltd. Vs. Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunal (1998) 2 SCC 70 that the pleadings have to be read
meaningfully and if on such a reading, it is found that there is no lis to be tried and the claim or
defence is ultimately one destined to doom, the Courts should not waste their time on trial of such
cases, to the prejudice of deserving cases. I have in Kawal Sachdeva Vs. Bala Rana
MANU/DE/1050/2013 dealt in detail the said aspect and need is thus not felt to elaborate further.
32. In the present case the argument raised by the appellant / defendant of the defence of Section
53A of the Transfer of Property Act is but a bogey or an illusion intended to delay the ejectment of
the appellant / defendant from the property and cannot be allowed to come in the way of immediate
disposal of the suit. There is nothing worth adjudication neither on the factual pleas nor on legal
pleas so as to deprive the respondents / plaintiffs from a decree of ejectment under Order 15 or
under Order 12 Rule 6 of the CPC.
33. I have besides in Sunil Kapoor supra also in M/S ASV Industry Vs. Surinder Mohan
MANU/DE/2060/2013 held that unless the nature of possession is found to have been changed
from that of a tenant to an agreement purchaser in part performance, as per dicta of this Court in
Jiwan Das Vs. Narain Das AIR 1981 Del. 291 an agreement purchaser simpliciter has no rights in the
property not only till the passing of a decree for specific performance of the agreement but even till
the execution of the conveyance in pursuance thereto, and a tenant is not entitled to continue in
possession merely for the reason of having filed a suit for specific performance of the Agreement to
Sell.
34. There is another aspect of the matter. If it were to be the case of the appellant / defendant that
possession was indeed agreed to be delivered and delivered to it in part performance of the
Agreement to Sell and which is not borne out from a bare reading of the Agreement to Sell itself then
it would be a case of an agreement from which the terms cannot be ascertained with reasonable
certainty and in which case also the defence of Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act is not
available.
35. No merit is thus found in the appeal which is dismissed with costs. Counsels fee assessed at
Rs.20,000/-.
Decree sheet be drawn up.
