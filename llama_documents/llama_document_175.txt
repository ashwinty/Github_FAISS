THE HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE A.V.SESHA SAI
AND
THE HON'BLE MS JUSTICE J.UMADEVI
COM.CA No.11 OF 2019
JUDGMENT:
(per AVSS,J.) Challenge in the present Commercial Court Appeal is to the order and decree dated
16.08.2019 passed by the Court of the Special Judge for trial and disposal of the Commercial
Disputes, Visakhapatnam, in CAOP No.38 of 2017 (Old AAP No.306 of 2017). The petitioner in the
said CAOP No.38 of 2017 is the appellant in the instant appeal. The appellant herein filed the said
CAOP No.38 of 2017 before the Special Court under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation
Act, 1996, praying to set aside the Award dated 15.12.2016 passed by the Arbitral Tribunal
(respondents 2 to 4 herein) on the claims made by respondent No.1 herein and the counter claims of
the appellant herein.
2. Briefly stated, the facts and circumstances, leading to filing of the present Commercial Court
Appeal, are as under:-
The appellant herein, i.e., Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited, Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, floated a
tender for structural steel plant works for Sinter Plant No.3 and in the said process, respondent No.1
herein emerged as the successful tenderer and the appellant herein awarded the contract in favour
of respondent No.1 and issued letter of acceptance on 05.04.2007. An agreement was also entered
into on 02.05.2007 and the contract value being Rs.3,49,00,000/-, including all taxes and duties,
but excluding service tax. The initial period of contract was 13 months from the date of letter of
acceptance and the said period came to an end on 28.04.2008. The appellant herein granted
extension for six times up to 30.06.2010.
Subsequently, a portion of the work was withdrawn by respondent No.1 and the same was awarded
in favour of M/s. Hindustan Steel Works Construction Limited on 05.08.2010 by undertaking
tender process. For the balance work of the 1st respondent herein, the appellant herein extended the
period up to 31.08.2010 and respondent No.1 herein requested further extension till 31.10.2010 by
way of a letter dated 07.09.2010, which was declined by the appellant herein, vide letter dated
08.09.2010. Thereafter, vide notice dated 14.12.2010, the appellant herein informed respondent
No.1 that the contract stood terminated by efflux of time and instructed respondent No.1 to vacate
the site.
On 15.06.2012, respondent No.1 herein did put forth claims worth Rs.5.45 crores and the appellant
herein gave a reply on 09.07.2012, turning down the same except the final bill amount and certain
extra items. Thereafter, the issues landed before the Arbitral Tribunal and respondent No.1 herein
laid claims for a total sum of Rs.5.45 crores.

3. Before the Arbitral Tribunal, respondent No.1 herein made 15 claims, whereas the appellant
herein made six counter claims. The Arbitral Tribunal, vide Award dated 15.12.2016, granted
amount under 12 claims and disallowed three claims laid by respondent No.1 and allowed one
counter claim and rejected five counter claims made by the appellant herein out of six counter
claims. Assailing the said Award, to the extent the same went against the appellant, the appellant
herein, by invoking the provisions of Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, filed
CAOP No.38 of 2017 on the file of the Court of the Special Judge for trial and disposal of the
Commercial Disputes, Visakhapatnam.
Learned Special Judge, by way of an order and decree dated 16.08.2019, dismissed the CAOP No.38
of 2017, confirming the Award dated 15.12.2016 rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal.
4. In the above background, challenging the validity and legal sustainability of the said order and
decree dated 16.08.2019, the present Commercial Court Appeal came to be preferred.
5. Heard Sri V.Ravinder Rao, learned Senior Counsel, representing Sri W.B.Srinivas, learned
counsel for the appellant and S/Sri P.V.Krishnaiah and M.Ramdas, learned counsel for respondent
No.1, apart from perusing the entire material available on record.
6. Submissions/Contentions of Sri V.Ravinder Rao, learned Senior Counsel:
(1) The order passed by the learned Special Judge, confirming the award of the Arbitral Tribunal is
highly erroneous, without jurisdiction, contrary to law, weight of evidence and probabilities of the
case and opposed to the very spirit and object of the provisions of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short, 'the Act, 1996') and the Micro, Small and Medium
Enterprises Development Act, 2006 (for short, 'MSMED Act').
(2) The order impugned is full of assumptions and presumptions and in total disregard of the
documentary evidence available on record and the basic principles of law.
(3) The claims made by respondent No.1 are beyond the terms and conditions of the contract, more
particularly, Clauses 17.2 and 18 of the General Conditions of Contract.
(4) The Arbitral Tribunal has no jurisdiction to award interest by invoking the provisions of the
MSMED Act and the claimant ought to have approached the appropriate forum for the said relief, if
so advised, by raising a dispute before the Facilitation Council under Sections 15 to 18 of the
MSMED Act, 2006.
(5) The reasoning given by the Tribunal that the appellant committed breach of contract is highly
perverse as the claimant himself breached the contract by not completing the work within the
extended period.
(6) The appellant herein did not commit any breach of contract, as such, respondent No.1 herein
would not be entitled for any compensation.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 2Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
(7) The appellant herein terminated the contract as per the terms and conditions of the contract, as
such, the termination of the contract cannot be faulted, and the Award, on the basis of the findings
arrived at, contra is neither sustainable nor tenable in the eye of law.
(8) The Tribunal granted claims 5 and 8 in violation of the terms and conditions of the contract and
substantive law and the same are not permissible in view of Clauses 23.1 and 18.5.1 of the General
Conditions of Contract read with Clause-15 of the Special Conditions of Contract.
(9) As per Clause 15.3 of the Special Conditions of Contract, if the delay is not attributable to the
contractor, the contractor is entitled for price variation only and not for damages as per Clauses 23.1
and 18.5.1 of the General Conditions of Contract read with Annexure-4.
(10) The Tribunal ought not to have awarded Claims 5 and 8 in view of Section 28(3) of the Act,
1996 and the phrase compensation as stipulated in Section 28(3) of the Act, 1996, is required to be
treated as liquidated damages.
(11) The judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Associate Builders Vs. Delhi Development
Authority 1 cannot be made applicable for claiming claims 5 and 8, since the clauses akin to clause
18.5.1 of the General Conditions of Contract was not there in the said reported case.
(12) All extensions were granted without liquidated damages, which the contractor already claimed
under Claim No.1 in the form of release of due payment of final bill (Rs.75,26,745-91 ps), labour
escalation bill (Rs.9,16,194-15 ps), POL escalation bill (Rs.35,383-65 ps) and material escalation bill
(Rs.16,38,044-72 ps), as such, the contractor is not entitled to claims 5 and 8 separately.
(13) Vide letters dated 20.04.2009 and 15.03.2010, contractor sought the extension and asked for
price escalation but not damages, but, for the first time, before the Arbitral Tribunal, the contractor
asked for damages. Price variation is in the form of liquidated damages, as such, grant of claims 5
and 8 is nothing but duplication and the said claims are in the nature of general damages and are
not (2015) 3 SCC 49 permissible in view of Clause 18.5.1 of the General Conditions of Contract.
(14) According to Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 contractor is only entitled for
reasonable compensation, i.e., price variation, already covered under claim No.1, as such, the
claimant is not entitled for amount covered by claims 5 and 8 and the price variation needs to be
treated as liquidated damages.
In support of his submissions and contentions, as regards claims 5 and 8, learned Senior Counsel
takes the support of the following judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court:
(1) Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited Vs. Tata Communications Limited2;
(2) Kailash Nath Associates Vs. Delhi Development Authority and another3;
(3) Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited Vs. Reliance Communication Limited4;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 3Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
(4) Union of India Vs. Raman Iron Foundry5;
(5) Fateh Chand Vs. Balkishan Dass6;
(2019) 5 SCC 341 (2015) 4 SCC 136 (2011) 1 SCC 394 (1974) 2 SCC 231 AIR 1963 SC 1405 (15)
According to the learned Senior Counsel, claims 4 and 7 are excepted matters in view of Clause 21.3
of the General Conditions of Contract, as such, these claims are not tenable.
(16) Proviso to Clause 21.3 of the General Conditions of Contract mandates the contractor to make
claim for extra works within 30 days to the Engineer supported by documents, but in the instant
case, contractor made a claim for extra works, i.e., under Claim No.4 on 05.01.2012, though the
contract was terminated on 31.08.2010, i.e., 1½ years after termination of the contract, i.e., during
the contractual period, the contractor did not raise the claim.
But however, the Executive Engineer allowed the claims 2, 4 to 10, but disallowed the claims 1, 3, 11
and 12, which are set out under claim No.4. Since the claims 4 and 7 are the accepted matters, they
are not tenable and the Arbitral Tribunal has no jurisdiction under Clause 28 of the General
Conditions of Contract.
In support of his contentions on claims 4 and 7, learned Senior Counsel places reliance on the
judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in M/s. Mitra Guha Builders (India) Company Vs. Oil and
Natural Gas Corporation Limited7 (Paras 16 to 29).
(2020) 3 SCC 222 (17) On Claim No.13, it is contended that as per Clause 9.3 of the General
Conditions of Contract, the contractor is not entitled for the said claim and it would not be open for
the contractor to claim anything under this head.
(18) On Claim No.14, it is contended by the learned Senior Counsel that in view of Clause 28.4 of
General Conditions of Contract, the Arbitral Tribunal has no jurisdiction to award interest.
(19) Arbitral Tribunal is the creature of the statute, and while exercising jurisdiction under the Act,
1996, the Arbitral Tribunal erred in awarding interest as per the MSMED Act, 2006.
In support of his contentions on claim No.14, learned Senior Counsel places reliance on the
following judgments:
(1) In Union of India v. Ambica Construction8 ;
(2) In Sri Chittaranjan Maity v. Union of India9 ;
(20) The Arbitral Tribunal is prohibited under Section 31(7) (a) of the Act, 1996 read with Clause
28.4 of the General Conditions of Contract. Once the Arbitral Tribunal is barred under Section 31(7)
(a) of the Act, 1996, read with Clause 28.4 of the General Conditions of Contract, the Arbitral
Tribunal cannot fall back on the provisions of the (2016) 6 SCC 36 (2017) 9 SCC 611 MSMED Act,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 4Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
2006 and the said provision of law will not confer jurisdiction on the Arbitral Tribunal to award
interest, and Sections 18 and 24 of the MSMED Act, 2006, would not come to the aid of the
appellant herein.
(21) Alternatively, it is the submission of Sri V.Ravinder Rao, learned Senior Counsel that the benefit
of Section 15 of the MSMED Act, 2006, is available only to the goods supplied by the contractors and
the services rendered to the buyer, but not for contractual works.
(22) The violation of the orders of the Constitutional Courts are required to be treated as the
decisions taken against the public policy (Referring Associate Builders Vs. Delhi Development
Authority's case reported in (2015) 3 SCC
49).
7. Submissions and contentions of S/Sri P.V.Krishnaiah and M.Ramdas, learned counsel for
respondents:
(1) The Award passed by the learned Arbitral Tribunal and the order passed by the learned Special
Judge under Section 34 of the Act, 1996, are strictly in accordance with the provisions of the said
legislation and that there are no errors, nor there exists any infirmities, in the impugned order of the
learned Special Judge, as such, the same does not warrant any interference of this Court under
Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
(2) The jurisdiction of the Courts is limited only to the extent of the grounds set out in sub-section
(2) of Section 34 of the Act, 1996 and in the instant case, there are no such grounds existing.
(3) Award of the Arbitral Tribunal cannot be impeached unless the same is contrary to the
provisions of the Act, 1996, and the terms of the contract and the said contingencies are
conspicuously absent in the case on hand.
(4) At no point of time, respondent No.1-contractor failed in fulfilling the obligations and the delay
in executing the contractual work was due to the attitude of the appellant and not due to the conduct
of respondent No.1-contractor.
(5) The grounds now sought to be pressed into service by the learned counsel for the appellant were
neither raised before the Arbitral Tribunal nor before the Special Court nor before this Court in the
Memorandum of Grounds of Appeal, as such, the same do not warrant any consideration by this
Court.
(6) The findings of the team of Arbitrators, in the absence of any person with judicial knowledge, are
not fatal to the Award in view of law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and in the instant
case, the First Arbitrator was appointed by the contractor and second Arbitrator by the appellant,
who in turn jointly elected the third Arbitrator.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 5Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
Learned counsel takes the support of the following judgments in support of the submissions:
(1) Municipal Corporation of Delhi Vs. M/s. Jagan Nath Ashok Kumar and another10
(2) P.R.Shah, Shares and Stock Brokers Private Limited Vs. B.H.H.Securities Private
Limited and others11 (7) In the absence of any fault on the part of any contractor, the
prohibition contained in Clause 19.1 cannot be applied for denying the claims 5 and
8.
(8) The decision in Kailash Nath Associates Vs. Delhi Development Authority and another (3 supra)
is applicable only in the cases where there is breach of contract and since there is no breach of
contract committed by the contractor, the said decision cannot be made applicable.
(9) Learned counsel places reliance on a decision in Associate Builders Vs. Delhi Development
Authority case (1 supra), to sustain the Award on claims 5 and 8.
(10) The contention as regards the liquidated damages was not raised before all the lower fora nor
raised in the Memorandum of Grounds of Appeal in the present appeal, as (1987) 4 SCC 497 (2012)
1 SCC 594 such, the same cannot be raised now orally for the first time during the course of
arguments.
(11) As per the appellant, claims 5 and 8 are also contrary to law, but the same cannot be sustained
and when there is a delay on the part of the appellant, clause 18.4 of the General Conditions of
Contract would not come to the rescue of the appellant herein. Learned counsel places reliance on
the judgment in Central Bank of India Vs. Virudhunagar Steel Rolling Mills Limited and others12.
(12) In view of Clause 17.1 of the Special Conditions of Contract and Clause 26.3 of the General
Conditions of Contract, contentions of the learned counsel for the appellant as regards claims 4 and
7 are not sustainable and he relies on a decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kalpraj Dharamshi
and another Vs. Kotak Investment Advisors Ltd., and another13.
(13) The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant as regards the claim-14 cannot be
sustained in view of the law laid down by the Bombay in M/s. Steel Authority of India Ltd., and
another Vs. Micro, Small Enterprise Facilitation Council, through Joint Director of Industries,
Nagpur Region, Nagpur14.
(2015) 16 SCC 207 2021 SCC Online SC 204 AIR 2012 Bombay HC 178 Both the learned counsel
have filed written arguments also.
8. In the above background, now, the issues which this Court is called upon to answer in the present
Commercial Court Appeal are:-
(1) Whether the order of the learned Special Judge, confirming the award passed by the Arbitral
Tribunal is in accordance with the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, the
Indian Contract, 1872 and the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 6Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
whether the contentions of the learned counsel for the appellant as regards claims 5 and 8 are
sustainable and tenable?
(2) Whether the findings of the learned Arbitral Tribunal, as confirmed by the learned Special
Judge, on claims 4 and 7 warrant any interference of this Court under Section 37 of the Arbitration
and Conciliation Act, 1996?
(3) Whether the Arbitral Tribunal is justified in granting relief covered by claim No.13 ?
(4) Whether the Arbitral Tribunal and the Special Judge are justified in granting interest to the
respondent- contractor on claim No.14 in view of the conditions of contract and Whether the
Tribunal and the Special Court are justified in invoking the provisions of the Micro, Small and
Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006?
9. Anterior to the process of examining, analyzing and adjudicating various issues that have cropped
up in the present Commercial Court Appeal, it may be highly essential and apposite to refer to the
provisions of Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, which read as follows:
" 34. Application for setting aside arbitral award.
1. Recourse to a Court against an arbitral award may be made only by an application
for setting aside such award in accordance with sub-section (2) and subsection (3).
2. An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court only if-
a. the party making the application furnishes proof that-
i. a party was under some incapacity, or ii. the arbitration agreement is not valid
under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon,
under the law for the time being in force; or iii. the party making the application was
not given proper notice of the appointment of an arbitrator or of the arbitral
proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his case; or iv. the arbitral award
deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the
submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the
submission to arbitration:
Provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated
from those not so submitted, only that part of the arbitral award which contains
decisions on matters not submitted to arbitration may be set aside; or v. the
composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance
with the agreement of the parties, unless such agreement was in conflict with a
provision of this Part from which the parties cannot derogate, or, failing such
agreement, was not in accordance with this Part; or b. the Court finds that-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 7Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
i. the subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under
the law for the time being in force, or ii. the arbitral award is in conflict with the
public policy of India.
[(2A) An arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than international
commercial arbitrations, may also be set aside by the Court, if the Court finds that the
award is vitiated by patent illegality appearing on the face of the award:
Provided that an award shall not be set aside merely on the ground of an erroneous
application of the law or by reappreciation of evidence.] (3) An application for setting
aside may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the
party making that application had received the arbitral award or, if a request had
been made under section 33, from the date on which that request had been disposed
of by the arbitral tribunal: Provided that if the Court is satisfied that the applicant
was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the said period
of three months it may entertain the application within a further period of thirty
days, but not thereafter.
(4) On receipt of an application under sub-section (1), the Court may, where it is
appropriate and it is so requested by a party, adjourn the proceedings for a period of
time determined by it in order to give the arbitral tribunal an opportunity to resume
the arbitral proceedings or to take such other action as in the opinion of arbitral
tribunal will eliminate the grounds for setting aside the arbitral award.
(5) An application under this section shall be filed by a party only after issuing a prior
notice to the other party and such application shall be accompanied by an affidavit by
the applicant endorsing compliance with the said requirement.
(6) An application under this section shall be disposed of expeditiously, and in any
event, within a period of one year from the date on which the notice referred to in
sub-section (5) is served upon the other party.]"
10. It is very much lucid and candid from a reading of the above provisions of law that the
application for setting aside an arbitral award is maintainable only in the contingencies stipulated
under Section 34(2)(a) (i to v) and Section 34(2)(b) and Section 34(2A) and Section 34(3) of the Act,
1996. The issues in the instant Commercial Court Appeal are required to be examined, analyzed and
resolved within the parameters of the above said provisions of law.
11. Respondent No.1 herein filed a claim statement, claiming as many as 15 claims and the
particulars of the same including the amounts awarded by the Arbitral Tribunal, vide Award dated

preferred CAOP No.38 of 2017 on the file of the Court of the Special Judge, and the Special Judge,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 11Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
by way of the questioned order and decree dated 16.08.2019, dismissed CAOP No.38 of 2017,
confirming the Award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal.
14. Though the present appeal came to be preferred against the entire Award, as confirmed by the
learned Special Judge, learned Senior Counsel, Sri V.Ravinder Rao, during the course of arguments,
mainly confined and advanced arguments on claims 4, 5, 7, 8, 13 and 14 only and did not press the
appeal in respect of the other claims and the counter claims. Therefore, this Court deems it
appropriate to deal with the said claims only.
15. Findings on Claims 5 and 8:
Claims 5 and 8 are as follows:
Claim No.5: Compensation for breach of contract such as non-issue of drawings, materials and
non-availability of fronts, etc. by the respondent, resulting in the time of completion getting
extended. The claim is on account of compensation of loss of profits and over-heads on the balance
works as on 29.04.2008; claim amount: Rs.68,25,022/- + Service Tax + interest.
Claim No.8: Revision of rates of the BOQ (Bill of Quantities) due to increase in all input costs for the
period beyond the original schedule date of completion till the claimant was allowed to execute the
work (i.e. from 29.04.2008 to 31.08.2010). Claim amount Rs.54,83,040/- (+) service tax (+)
interest as applicable to SSI Units.
Against the amounts so claimed, the Arbitral Tribunal, vide Award dated 15.12.2016, granted
Rs.40,95,013/- + service tax of Rs.6,14,252/- and Rs.36,49,047/- + service tax of Rs.5,47,357/- +
interest, respectively, against the claim Nos. 5 and 8.
16. While attacking the grant of claims 5 and 8, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant, Sri
V.Ravinder Rao, maintains that having allowed claim No.1, which pertains to release of final bill,
labour wage escalation, POL escalation and material escalation, the Arbitral Tribunal grossly erred
in granting claims 5 and 8 and the same tantamounts to duplication in granting the reliefs. It is the
further submission of learned Senior Counsel that the Tribunal totally ignored clauses 18.5.1, 21.1,
21.3 and 23.1 of the General Conditions of Contract, while awarding the claims and also condition
No.15 of the Special Conditions of Contract and Annexure-4 thereof. In this context, it may be apt to
extract the said conditions of contract.
17. Clause 18.5.1 of the General Conditions of Contract reads thus:
Extension of time for Completion: Should the quantum of extra or additional work of
any kind or other special circumstances of any kind whatsoever which may occur be
such as fairly entitle the Contractor to an extension of time for the completion of the
Work, the Engineer shall decide the amount of such extension. However the Engineer
is not bound to take into account any extra or additional work or other special
circumstances, unless the Contractor has within thirty (30) days after such work has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 12Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
been commenced or such circumstances have arisen or as soon thereafter as is
practicable but not later than thirty (30) days delivered to the Engineer full and
detailed particulars of any claim for extension of time to which he may consider
himself entitled in order that such claim may be investigated at that time. In my case,
the Contractor shall not be entitled to Revision of Price, any compensation or
damages on account of such extension of completion period."
18. Clause 21.0 deals with alterations, additions and omissions and the same read as infra:
"Clause 21.1: Variations: The Engineer/Consultant shall have the right to make any variations of the
form, quality or quantity of the Work or any part thereof that may in his opinion be
necessary/required for the completeness of the Work and for any other reasons which in his opinion
be desirable/required, he shall have right to order the Contractor to do any of this following:-
a) increase or decrease the quantity of any work/ works included in the Contract.
b) omit any such work/works.
c) change the character or quality or kind of any such work/works.
d) change the levels, lines, position and dimensions of any part the work/works.
e) execute additional work of any kind necessary for the completion of the work/works.
and no such variation shall in any way vitiate or invalidate the Contract but the value of all such
variations shall be taken into account in ascertaining the amount of the Contract Price and
adjustment of time for completion, if required.
Clause 21.2 : Orders for variations to be in writing: No such variation shall be made by the
Contractor without an order in writing of the Engineer/Consultant. Provided that no order in
writing shall be required for increase or decrease in the quantity of any work where such increase or
decrease is not the result of any order given order this Clause, but is the result of the quantities
exceeding or being less than those stated in the Bill of Quantities.
Provided also that if for any reason, the Engineer/ Consultant shall consider it desirable to give any
such order, verbally, the Contractor shall comply with such order and confirmation by the
Contractor in writing of such verbal order given by Engineer / Consultant shall be deemed to be an
order in writing subject to Clause No.5.3 hereof."
19. Clause 23.1 of the General Conditions of Contract reads as follows:
"Clause 23.1: Prices or the Rates for the Work stipulated in the Contract, shall remain
firm and binding during the Contract Period subject to the variations stipulated in
the Special Conditions of the Contract."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 13Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
20. Clause 15.0 of the General Conditions of Contract reads as under:
"Clause 15.0: Price Variation:
Clause 15.1: The price variation on accepted rates of the Bill of Quantities will be
permissible to the extent given in Annexure-4 enclosed. The rates quoted by the
Tenderer shall be inclusive of all taxes, levies, duties, etc., but exclusive of Service tax
and Education Cess thereon prevailing on the date of opening of Envelop-2.
Clause 15.2 : During tenure of the Contract, if any new taxes, duties/levies, etc., are
imposed or tax rates undergo changes as notified by the Govt. and become applicable
to the subject works, the same shall be reimbursed by the Employer on production of
documentary evidence in respect of payment of the same. Benefits accruing to the
Contractor on account of withdrawal/reduction in any existing taxes and duties, the
same shall be passed on to the Employer.
Clause 15.3 : The variations due to 15.1 and 15.2 above shall not be permissible during
the extended period of contract, if the delay is attributable to the Contractor."
21. Annexure-4 of the Special Conditions of Contract which deals with Price Variation Formula
reads as follows:
"ANNEXURE-4 (As per Clause No.15.0 of Special Conditions of Contract) PRICE
VARIATION FORMULA The following clause relating to variation in wages shall be
applicable. No other claim on account of any other variation either statutory or
otherwise shall be applicable.
(CLARIFICATION: In case of revision of rates of materials, wages & POL prices with
effect from any date in a month say March, 2006. The work done with effect from
subsequent month (i.e., April, 2006) only will qualify for price variation as per the
above formula.) 1.0. PRICE VARIATION DUE TO LABOUR:
1.1 Price variation on account of wages for fabrication of steel structures/pipe work:
For every rupee per month of 208 hours by which the wage structure of minimum
rates workers varied from the base month as a result of Government action (direct or
indirect), adjudication (legislative or otherwise), the selling price, exclusive of
escalation claims shall be adjusted by Rs.2.0 (Rupees two only) per tonne and such
adjustment shall be applied to such selling prices in respect of structures inspected
and accepted after the first day of the subsequent month of such wage revision.
i) For the purpose of this order, the base date shall be the date of opening of the
Envelope-2.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 14Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
For the purpose of this clause the wage structure of minimum rated workers shall be defined as
comprising:

4) Employees State Insurance Contribution.
1.2 Escalation for erection in the composite rate of fabrication and erection:
For the purpose of calculating the price variation for erection work, the erection cost component in
the awarded composite rates of fabrication and erection shall be taken as 30% of the relevant items.
Against this 30% value, representing the erection cost, the labour component in the erection cost
shall be taken as 40%. On this basis, the payable/deductible price variation towards erection shall be
computed as per the following formula:

say March, 2006, the work done with effect from the first day ofsubsequent month (i.e., 15 April,
2006) only will qualify for price variation as per the above formula.
ii) In case of more than one revision in the rate of Ordinary High Speed Diesel Oil, in a month, the
latest revision in the rates shall be considered for payment of escalation."
22. In this context, it may be apt to refer to the observations of the Arbitral Tribunal while dealing
with claim No.5. The Tribunal, on the basis of the material available came to a conclusion that the
RINL/appellant herein did not provide any fronts till 28.04.2008 for erection of fabricated
structures thereby committed breach of contract and the Tribunal also took into consideration
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 17Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 which reads as follows:
"73. Compensation for loss or damage caused by breach of contract.--When a
contract has been broken, the party who suffers by such breach is entitled to receive,
from the party who has broken the contract, compensation for any loss or damage
caused to him thereby, which naturally arose in the usual course of things from such
breach, or which the parties knew, when they made the contract, to be likely to result
from the breach of it. Such compensation is not to be given for any remote and
indirect loss or damage sustained by reason of the breach.
COMPENSATION FOR FAILURE TO DISCHARGE OBLIGATION RESEMBLING
THOSE CREATED BY CONTRACT- When an obligation resembling those created by
contract has been incurred and has not been discharged, any person injured by the
failure to discharge it, is entitled to receive the same compensation from the party in
default, as if such person had contracted to discharge it and had broken his contract.
Explanation: In estimating the loss or damage, arising from a breach of contract, the
means which existed of remedying the inconvenience caused by the non-performance
of the contract must be taken into account."
It is very much manifest from a reading of the above provision of law that when there is a breach of
contract, the party who commits such breach, shall compensate the person who suffers by such
breach by way of paying compensation for any loss or damage caused.
23. The Tribunal also took into account the letters of the claimant dated 16.04.2008 and 26.04.2008
and found that the extension of time granted to the claimant was without liquidated damages and
with escalations. The Tribunal also found that respondent No.1-contractor, at no point of time, was
responsible for the delays and all the delays were attributable only to the appellant herein. The
Special Court also while placing reliance on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in P.M.Paul
Vs. Union of India15, eventually held in respect of claim No.5 that there was nothing to discredit the
findings of the Arbitral Tribunal on claim No.5. In view of the said cogent and convincing reasons
assigned by the learned Arbitral Tribunal, as confirmed by the Special Judge, this Court does not
find any valid reasons to disturb the findings recorded on claim No.5 by the Special Judge. It is also
significant to note, as pointed out by the learned counsel for the 1st respondent herein, that
RINL/appellant herein did not plead specifically either before the Arbitral Tribunal or before the
Special Court or before this Court in the Memorandum of Grounds of Appeal in the present appeal,
in the manner now sought to be projected during the course of arguments.
24. Coming to Claim No.8 -- Which pertains to revision of BOQ rates under the period beyond the
original schedule of compensation, the claimant laid a claim of Rs.54,83,040/- on the ground that
during the currency of the contract, all input costs went up considerably including costs of labour
and overhead charges. The Tribunal recorded a finding that had the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant
come forward in fulfilling their obligations, the project might have been completed by the claimant
in time and the present (1989) 1 SCC 368 situation could have been averted. The appellant herein
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 18Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
contended before the Arbitral Tribunal that due to inadequate mobilization of the resources by the
claimant, the contract could not be completed within the agreed period.
After taking into account all the contentions including clauses 18.4 and 28.1 and contention that
these claims are excepted matters, the Tribunal turned down the contentions of the appellant on the
ground that the breach was solely attributable to the appellant and eventually found that the
Visakhapatnam Steel Plant had to compensate when it committed breach of contract. The learned
Special Judge by placing reliance on the judgments of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Associate
Builders Vs. Delhi Development Authority (1 supra), Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited Vs.
Saw Pipes Limited reported in AIR 2003 SC 2629 and J.K.Cold Tyres Retreads Vs. Union of India
and another reported in 2015(1) ALD 532, declined to interfere with the Award of the Arbitral
Tribunal. Therefore, this Court does not find any valid reason to disturb the finding recorded by the
Arbitral Tribunal and the Special Judge on Claim No.8 also.
25. In this context, it may be appropriate to refer to the judgments cited by the learned Advocates.
In the case of Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited Vs. Tata Communications Limited (2 supra),
the Hon'ble Apex Court, at paragraphs 11 to 13, held in the following manner.
"11. In Kailash Nath Associates v. DDA, (2015) 4 SCC 136, after considering the case law on Section
74, this Court held:
"43. On a conspectus of the above authorities, the law on compensation for breach of contract under
Section 74 can be stated to be as follows:
43.1. Where a sum is named in a contract as a liquidated amount payable by way of damages, the
party complaining of a breach can receive as reasonable compensation such liquidated amount only
if it is a genuine pre-estimate of damages fixed by both parties and found to be such by the court. In
other cases, where a sum is named in a contract as a liquidated amount payable by way of damages,
only reasonable compensation can be awarded not exceeding the amount so stated. Similarly, in
cases where the amount fixed is in the nature of penalty, only reasonable compensation can be
awarded not exceeding the penalty so stated. In both cases, the liquidated amount or penalty is the
upper limit beyond which the court cannot grant reasonable compensation.
43.2. Reasonable compensation will be fixed on well- known principles that are applicable to the law
of contract, which are to be found inter alia in Section 73 of the Contract Act.
43.3. Since Section 74 awards reasonable compensation for damage or loss caused by a breach of
contract, damage or loss caused is a sine qua non for the applicability of the section.
43.4. The section applies whether a person is a plaintiff or a defendant in a suit.
43.5. The sum spoken of may already be paid or be payable in future.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 19Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
43.6. The expression "whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused thereby"
means that where it is possible to prove actual damage or loss, such proof is not dispensed with. It is
only in cases where damage or loss is difficult or impossible to prove that the liquidated amount
named in the contract, if a genuine pre-estimate of damage or loss, can be awarded."
12. In the present case, clauses 16.2 to 16.4 are relevant, and are set out as under:
"16.2 (a) FOR DELIVERY OF STORES:
Should the supplier fail to deliver the store/services or any consignment thereof within the period
prescribed for delivery, the purchaser shall be entitled to recover 0.5% of the value of the delayed
supply for each week of delay or part thereof for a period up to 10 (TEN) weeks and thereafter at the
rate of 0.7% of the value of the delayed supply for each week of delay or part thereof for another
TEN weeks of delay. In the case of package supply where the delayed portion of the supply
materially hampers installation and commissioning of the systems, L/D charges shall be levied as
above on the total value of the concerned package of the Purchase Order. However, when supply is
made within 21 days of QA clearance in the extended delivery period, the consignee may accept the
stores and in such cases the LD shall be levied upto the date of QA clearance.
16.2 (b) FOR INSTALLATION & COMMISSIONING Should the supplier fail to install and
commission the project within the stipulated time the purchaser shall be entitled to recover 0.5% of
the value of the purchase order for each week of delay or part thereof for a period upto 10 (TEN)
weeks and thereafter @ 0.7% of the value of purchase order for each week of delay or part thereof
for another 10 (TEN) weeks of delay. In cases, where the delay affects installation/commissioning of
part of the project and part of the equipment is already in commercial use, then in such cases, LD
shall be levied on the affected part of the project.
16.2 (c). The Liquidated Damages, as per Clause 16.2
(a) and 16.2 (b) above shall be limited to a maximum of 12%, even in case the DP extension is given
beyond 20 weeks.
16.3. Provisions contained in Clause 16.2(a) shall not be applicable for durations (periods) which
attract L.D. against clause 16.2(b) above.
16.4. Quantum of liquidated damages assessed and levied by the purchaser shall be final and not
challengeable by the supplier."
13. As has been correctly held by the impugned judgment, a maximum of 12% can be levied as
liquidated damages under the contract, which sum would amount to a sum of INR 25 lakh. Since
this clause governs the relations between the parties, obviously, a higher figure, contractually
speaking, cannot be awarded as liquidated damages, which are to be considered as final and not
challengeable by the supplier. This being the case, the appellant can claim only this sum. Anything
claimed above this sum would have to be refunded to the respondent."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 20Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
In case of Kailash Nath Associates Vs. Delhi Development Authority and another (3 supra), the
Hon'ble Supreme Court ruled as follows : (paragraphs 31 to 43) "31. Section 74 as it originally stood
read thus:
"When a contract has been broken, if a sum is named in the contract as the amount to be paid in
case of such breach, the party complaining of the breach is entitled, whether or not actual damage or
loss is proved to have been caused thereby, to receive from the party who has broken the contract
reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so named."
32. By an amendment made in 1899, the Section was amended to read: "74. Compensation for
breach of contract where penalty stipulated for.- When a contract has been broken, if a sum is
named in the contract as the amount to be paid in case of such breach, or if the contract contains
any other stipulation by way of penalty, the party complaining of the breach is entitled, whether or
not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused thereby, to receive from the party who has
broken the contract reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so named or, as the case
may be, the penalty stipulated for.
Explanation.-A stipulation for increased interest from the date of default may be a stipulation by
way of penalty.
Exception.-When any person enters into any bail-bond, recognizance or other instrument of the
same nature, or, under the provisions of any law, or under the orders of the Central Government or
of any State Government, gives any bond for the performance of any public duty or act in which the
public are interested, he shall be liable, upon breach of any condition of any such instrument, to pay
the whole sum mentioned therein.
Explanation.-A person who enters into a contract with Government does not necessarily thereby
undertake any public duty, or promise to do an act in which the public are interested."
33. Section 74 occurs in Chapter 6 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 which reads "Of the
consequences of breach of contract". It is in fact sandwiched between Sections 73 and 75 which deal
with compensation for loss or damage caused by breach of contract and compensation for damage
which a party may sustain through non-
fulfillment of a contract after such party rightfully rescinds such contract. It is important to note that
like Sections 73 and 75, compensation is payable for breach of contract under Section 74 only where
damage or loss is caused by such breach.
34. In Fateh Chand v. Balkishan Das, 1964 SCR (1) 515, this Court held: "The section is clearly an
attempt to eliminate the somewhat elaborate refinements made under the English common law in
distinguishing between stipulations providing for payment of liquidated damages and stipulations in
the nature of penalty. Under the common law a genuine pre-estimate of damages by mutual
agreement is regarded as a stipulation naming liquidated damages and binding between the parties:
a stipulation in a contract in terrorem is a penalty and the Court refuses to enforce it, awarding to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 21Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
the aggrieved party only reasonable compensation. The Indian Legislature has sought to cut across
the web of rules and presumptions under the English common law, by enacting a uniform principle
applicable to all stipulations naming amounts to be paid in case of breach, and stipulations by way
of penalty.
....
Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act deals with the measure of damages in two classes of cases (i)
where the contract names a sum to be paid in case of breach and (ii) where the contract contains any
other stipulation by way of penalty. We are in the present case not concerned to decide whether a
covenant of forfeiture of deposit for due performance of a contract falls within the first class. The
measure of damages in the case of breach of a stipulation by way of penalty is by Section 74
reasonable compensation not exceeding the penalty stipulated for. In assessing damages the Court
has, subject to the limit of the penalty stipulated, jurisdiction to award such compensation as it
deems reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case. Jurisdiction of the Court to
award compensation in case of breach of contract is unqualified except as to the maximum
stipulated; but compensation has to be reasonable, and that imposes upon the Court duty to award
compensation according to settled principles. The section undoubtedly says that the aggrieved party
is entitled to receive compensation from the party who has broken the contract, whether or not
actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused by the breach. Thereby it merely dispenses with
proof of "actual loss or damages"; it does not justify the award of compensation when in
consequence of the breach no legal injury at all has resulted, because compensation for breach of
contract can be awarded to make good loss or damage which naturally arose in the usual course of
things, or which the parties knew when they made the contract, to be likely to result from the
breach."(At page 526, 527) Section 74 declares the law as to liability upon breach of contract where
compensation is by agreement of the parties pre-determined, or where there is a stipulation by way
of penalty. But the application of the enactment is not restricted to cases where the aggrieved party
claims relief as a plaintiff. The section does not confer a special benefit upon any party; it merely
declares the law that notwithstanding any term in the contract predetermining damages or
providing for forfeiture of any property by way of penalty, the court will award to the party aggrieved
only reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount named or penalty stipulated. The
jurisdiction of the court is not determined by the accidental circumstance of the party in default
being a plaintiff or a defendant in a suit. Use of the expression "to receive from the party who has
broken the contract" does not predicate that the jurisdiction of the court to adjust amounts which
have been paid by the party in default cannot be exercised in dealing with the claim of the party
complaining of breach of contract. The court has to adjudge in every case reasonable compensation
to which the plaintiff is entitled from the defendant on breach of the contract. Such compensation
has to be ascertained having regard to the conditions existing on the date of the breach."(At page
530)
35. Similarly, in Maula Bux v. Union of India (UOI), 1970 (1) SCR 928, it was held:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 22Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
"Forfeiture of earnest money under a contract for sale of property- movable or immovable-if the
amount is reasonable, does not fall within Section 74. That has been decided in several cases
:Kunwar Chiranjit Singh v. Har Swarup, A.I.R.1926 P.C.1; Roshan Lal v. The Delhi Cloth and
General Mills Company Ltd., Delhi, I.L.R. All.166; Muhammad Habibullah v. Muhammad Shafi,
I.L.R. All. 324; Bishan Chand v. Radha Kishan Das, I.D. 19 All. 49. These cases are easily explained,
for forfeiture of a reasonable amount paid as earnest money does not amount to imposing a penalty.
But if forfeiture is of the nature of penalty, Section 74 applies. Where under the terms of the contract
the party in breach has undertaken to pay a sum of money or to forfeit a sum of money which he has
already paid to the party complaining of a breach of contract, the undertaking is of the nature of a
penalty.
Counsel for the Union, however, urged that in the present case Rs. 10,000/- in respect of the potato
contract and Rs. 8,500 in respect of the poultry contract were genuine pre-estimates of damages
which the Union was likely to suffer as a result of breach of contract, and the plaintiff was not
entitled to any relief against forfeiture. Reliance in support of this contention was placed upon the
expression (used in Section 74 of the Contract Act), "the party complaining of the breach is entitled,
whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused thereby, to receive from the
party who has broken the contract reasonable compensation". It is true that in every case of breach
of contract the person aggrieved by the breach is not required to prove actual loss or damage
suffered by him before he can claim a decree, and the Court is competent to award reasonable
compensation in case of breach even if no actual damage is proved to have been suffered in
consequence of the breach of contract. But the expression "whether or not actual damage or loss is
proved to have been caused thereby" is intended to cover different classes of contracts which come
before the Courts. In case of breach of some contracts it may be impossible for the Court to assess
compensation arising from breach, while in other cases compensation can be calculated in
accordance with established rules. Where the Court is unable to assess the compensation, the sum
named by the parties if it be regarded as a genuine pre- estimate may be taken into consideration as
the measure of reasonable compensation, but not if the sum named is in the nature of a penalty.
Where loss in terms of money can be determined, the party claiming compensation must prove the
loss suffered by him.
In the present case, it was possible for the Government of India to lead evidence to prove the rates at
which potatoes, poultry, eggs and fish were purchased by them when the plaintiff failed to deliver
"regularly and fully" the quantities stipulated under the terms of the contracts and after the
contracts were terminated. They could have proved the rates at which they had to be purchased and
also the other incidental charges incurred by them in procuring the goods contracted for. But no
such attempt was made."(At page 933,934)
36. In Shree Hanuman Cotton Mills and Anr. v. Tata Aircraft Limited, 1970 (3) SCR 127 it was held:
"From a review of the decisions cited above, the following principles emerge regarding "earnest":
(1) It must be given at the moment at which the contract is concluded.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 23Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
(2) It represents a guarantee that the contract will be fulfilled or, in other words, 'earnest' is given to
bind the contract.
(3) It is part of the purchase price when the transaction is carried out.
(4) It is forfeited when the transaction falls through by reason of the default or failure of the
purchaser.
(5) Unless there is anything to the contrary in the terms of the contract, on default committed by the
buyer, the seller is entitled to forfeit the earnest" (At page 139) "The learned Attorney General very
strongly urged that the pleas covered by the second contention of the appellant had never been
raised in the pleadings nor in the contentions urged before the High Court. The question of the
quantum of earnest deposit which was forfeited being unreasonable or the forfeiture being by way of
penalty, were never raised by the appellants. The Attorney General also pointed out that as noted by
the High Court the appellants led no evidence at all and, after abandoning the various pleas taken in
the plaint, the only question pressed before the High Court was that the deposit was not by way of
earnest and hence the amount could not be forfeited. Unless the appellants had pleaded and
established that there was unreasonableness attached to the amount required to be deposited under
the contract or that the clause regarding forfeiture amounted to a stipulation by way of a penalty, the
respondents had no opportunity to satisfy the Court that no question of unreasonableness or the
stipulation being by way of penalty arises. He further urged that the question of unreasonableness or
otherwise regarding earnest money does not at all arise when it is forfeited according to the terms of
the contract.
In our opinion the learned Attorney General is well founded in his contention that the appellants
raised no such contentions covered by the second point, noted above. It is therefore unnecessary for
us to go into the question as to whether the amount deposited by the appellants, in this case, by way
of earnest and forfeited as such, can be considered to be reasonable or not. We express no opinion
on the question as to whether the element of unreasonableness can ever be considered regarding the
forfeiture of an amount deposited by way of earnest and if so what are the necessary factors to be
taken into account in considering the reasonableness or otherwise of the amount deposited by way
of earnest. If the appellants were contesting the claim on any such grounds, they should have laid
the foundation for the same by raising appropriate pleas and also led proper evidence regarding the
same, so that the respondents would have had an opportunity of meeting such a claim."(At page
142)
37. And finally in ONGC Ltd. v. Saw Pipes Ltd., (2003) 5 SCC 705, it was held:
"64. It is apparent from the aforesaid reasoning recorded by the Arbitral Tribunal that it failed to
consider Sections 73 and 74 of the Indian Contract Act and the ratio laid down in Fateh Chand case
[AIR 1963 SC 140: (1964) 1 SCR 515 at p. 526] wherein it is specifically held that jurisdiction of the
court to award compensation in case of breach of contract is unqualified except as to the maximum
stipulated; and compensation has to be reasonable. Under Section 73, when a contract has been
broken, the party who suffers by such breach is entitled to receive compensation for any loss caused
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 24Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
to him which the parties knew when they made the contract to be likely to result from the breach of
it. This section is to be read with Section 74, which deals with penalty stipulated in the contract,
inter alia (relevant for the present case) provides that when a contract has been broken, if a sum is
named in the contract as the amount to be paid in case of such breach, the party complaining of
breach is entitled, whether or not actual loss is proved to have been caused, thereby to receive from
the party who has broken the contract reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so
named. Section 74 emphasizes that in case of breach of contract, the party complaining of the
breach is entitled to receive reasonable compensation whether or not actual loss is proved to have
been caused by such breach. Therefore, the emphasis is on reasonable compensation. If the
compensation named in the contract is by way of penalty, consideration would be different and the
party is only entitled to reasonable compensation for the loss suffered. But if the compensation
named in the contract for such breach is genuine pre-estimate of loss which the parties knew when
they made the contract to be likely to result from the breach of it, there is no question of proving
such loss or such party is not required to lead evidence to prove actual loss suffered by him.
67........In our view, in such a contract, it would be difficult to prove exact loss or damage which the
parties suffer because of the breach thereof. In such a situation, if the parties have pre-estimated
such loss after clear understanding, it would be totally unjustified to arrive at the conclusion that the
party who has committed breach of the contract is not liable to pay compensation. It would be
against the specific provisions of Sections 73 and 74 of the Indian Contract Act. There was nothing
on record that compensation contemplated by the parties was in any way unreasonable. It has been
specifically mentioned that it was an agreed genuine pre- estimate of damages duly agreed by the
parties. It was also mentioned that the liquidated damages are not by way of penalty. It was also
provided in the contract that such damages are to be recovered by the purchaser from the bills for
payment of the cost of material submitted by the contractor. No evidence is led by the claimant to
establish that the stipulated condition was by way of penalty or the compensation contemplated
was, in any way, unreasonable. There was no reason for the Tribunal not to rely upon the clear and
unambiguous terms of agreement stipulating pre-estimate damages because of delay in supply of
goods. Further, while extending the time for delivery of the goods, the respondent was informed that
it would be required to pay stipulated damages.
68. From the aforesaid discussions, it can be held that:
(1) Terms of the contract are required to be taken into consideration before arriving at the
conclusion whether the party claiming damages is entitled to the same.
(2) If the terms are clear and unambiguous stipulating the liquidated damages in case of the breach
of the contract unless it is held that such estimate of damages/compensation is unreasonable or is
by way of penalty, party who has committed the breach is required to pay such compensation and
that is what is provided in Section 73 of the Contract Act.
(3) Section 74 is to be read along with Section 73 and, therefore, in every case of breach of contract,
the person aggrieved by the breach is not required to prove actual loss or damage suffered by him
before he can claim a decree. The court is competent to award reasonable compensation in case of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 25Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
breach even if no actual damage is proved to have been suffered in consequence of the breach of a
contract.
(4) In some contracts, it would be impossible for the court to assess the compensation arising from
breach and if the compensation contemplated is not by way of penalty or unreasonable, the court
can award the same if it is genuine pre-estimate by the parties as the measure of reasonable
compensation."
38. It will be seen that when it comes to forfeiture of earnest money, in Fateh Chand's case, counsel
for the appellant conceded on facts that Rs.1,000/- deposited as earnest money could be forfeited.
(See: 1964 (1) SCR Page 515 at 525 and 531).
39. Shree Hanuman Cotton Mills & Another which was so heavily relied by the Division Bench again
was a case where the appellants conceded that they committed breach of contract. Further, the
respondents also pleaded that the appellants had to pay them a sum of Rs.42,499/- for loss and
damage sustained by them. (See: 1970 (3) SCR 127 at Page 132). This being the fact situation, only
two questions were argued before the Supreme Court: (1) that the amount paid by the plaintiff is not
earnest money and (2) that forfeiture of earnest money can be legal only if the amount is considered
reasonable. (at page 133). Both questions were answered against the appellant. In deciding question
two against the appellant, this Court held:-
"But, as we have already mentioned, we do not propose to go into those aspects in the case on hand.
As mentioned earlier, the appellants never raised any contention that the forfeiture of the amount
amounted to a penalty or that the amount forfeited is so large that the forfeiture is bad in law. Nor
have they raised any contention that the amount of deposit is so unreasonable and therefore
forfeiture of the entire amount is not justified. The decision in Maula Bux's [1970]1SCR928 had no
occasion to consider the question of reasonableness or otherwise of the earnest deposit being
forfeited. Because, from the said judgment it is clear that this Court did not agree with the view of
the High Court that the deposits made, and which were under consideration, were paid as earnest
money. It is under those circumstances that this Court proceeded to consider the applicability of
Section 74 of the Contract Act. (At page 143)"
40. From the above, it is clear that this Court held that Maula Bux's case was not, on facts, a case
that related to earnest money. Consequently, the observation in Maula Bux that forfeiture of earnest
money under a contract if reasonable does not fall within Section 74, and would fall within Section
74 only if earnest money is considered a penalty is not on a matter that directly arose for decision in
that case. The law laid down by a Bench of 5 Judges in Fateh Chand's case is that all stipulations
naming amounts to be paid in case of breach would be covered by Section 74. This is because
Section 74 cuts across the rules of the English Common Law by enacting a uniform principle that
would apply to all amounts to be paid in case of breach, whether they are in the nature of penalty or
otherwise. It must not be forgotten that as has been stated above, forfeiture of earnest money on the
facts in Fateh Chand's case was conceded. In the circumstances, it would therefore be correct to say
that as earnest money is an amount to be paid in case of breach of contract and named in the
contract as such, it would necessarily be covered by Section 74.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 26Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
41. It must, however, be pointed out that in cases where a public auction is held, forfeiture of earnest
money may take place even before an agreement is reached, as DDA is to accept the bid only after
the earnest money is paid. In the present case, under the terms and conditions of auction, the
highest bid (along with which earnest money has to be paid) may well have been rejected. In such
cases, Section 74 may not be attracted on its plain language because it applies only "when a contract
has been broken".
42. In the present case, forfeiture of earnest money took place long after an agreement had been
reached. It is obvious that the amount sought to be forfeited on the facts of the present case is
sought to be forfeited without any loss being shown. In fact it has been shown that far from suffering
any loss, DDA has received a much higher amount on re-auction of the same plot of land.
43. On a conspectus of the above authorities, the law on compensation for breach of contract under
Section 74 can be stated to be as follows:- Where a sum is named in a contract as a liquidated
amount payable by way of damages, the party complaining of a breach can receive as reasonable
compensation such liquidated amount only if it is a genuine pre-estimate of damages fixed by both
parties and found to be such by the Court. In other cases, where a sum is named in a contract as a
liquidated amount payable by way of damages, only reasonable compensation can be awarded not
exceeding the amount so stated. Similarly, in cases where the amount fixed is in the nature of
penalty, only reasonable compensation can be awarded not exceeding the penalty so stated. In both
cases, the liquidated amount or penalty is the upper limit beyond which the Court cannot grant
reasonable compensation.
Reasonable compensation will be fixed on well known principles that are applicable to the law of
contract, which are to be found inter alia in Section 73 of the Contract Act.
Since Section 74 awards reasonable compensation for damage or loss caused by a breach of contract,
damage or loss caused is a sine qua non for the applicability of the Section.
The Section applies whether a person is a plaintiff or a defendant in a suit.
The sum spoken of may already be paid or be payable in future.
The expression "whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused thereby" means
that where it is possible to prove actual damage or loss, such proof is not dispensed with. It is only in
cases where damage or loss is difficult or impossible to prove that the liquidated amount named in
the contract, if a genuine pre-estimate of damage or loss, can be awarded.
Section 74 will apply to cases of forfeiture of earnest money under a contract. Where, however,
forfeiture takes place under the terms and conditions of a public auction before agreement is
reached, Section 74 would have no application."
In case of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited Vs. Reliance Communication Limited (4 supra), the
Hon'ble Supreme Court held as under: (paragraph 53) "53. Lastly, it may be noted that liquidated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 27Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
damages serve the useful purpose of avoiding litigation and promoting commercial certainty and,
therefore, the court should not be astute to categorize as penalties the clauses described as
liquidated damages. This principle is relevant to regulatory regimes. It is important to bear in mind
that while categorizing damages as "penal" or "liquidated damages", one must keep in mind the
concept of pricing of these contracts and the level playing field provided to the operators because it
is on costing and pricing that the loss to BSNL is measured and, therefore, all calls during the
relevant period have to be seen. [See Communications Law in India by Vikram Raghavan at page
639]. Since clause 6.4.6 represents pre-estimate of reasonable compensation, Section 74 of the
Contract Act is not violated. Thus, it is not necessary to discuss various judgments of this Court
under Section 74 of the Contract Act."
In the case of Union of India Vs. Raman Iron Foundry (5 supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as
under:
(Para 11).
"11. The language used in the body of cl. 18 also supports the view that it is with
recovery of sums presently due and payable by the ,contractor to the purchaser that
this clause deals. It may be noted that cl. 18 does not lay down the substantive rights
and obligations of the parties under the contract. It is merely intended to provide a
mode of recovery of ' a claim for payment of a sum of money arising out of or under
the contract". It, therefore, postulates a claim for a sum which is due and payable,
that is. presently recoverable and may be recovered by the mode therein provided. it
is difficult to believe that the contracting parties could have intended that even
though a sum is not due and payable by the contractor to the purchaser under the
contract, the purchaser should be entitled to recover it. It is important to note that cl.
18 does not -create a lien on other sums due to the contractor or give to the purchaser
a right to retain such sums until his claim against the contractor is satisfied.If merely
a right of lien or retention were given to secure payment of a claim, then even if the
claim were for a sum not presently due and payable, the provision perhaps would not
have been so startling ,or unusual. But here the right given to the purchaser under. cl.
18 is a right to recover the amount of his claim by appropriating other sums due to
the contractor and, on the, interpretation of the appellant, this can be done even if
the claim is for a sum which is not due or payable in praesenti and the purchaser is
otherwise not entitled to recover it. That would indeed be a highly extra-ordinary
result which we would be loathe to reach in the absence of clear and compelling
language. This interpretation, if accepted, would mean that as soon as a claim is
made by the purchaser, it would immediately become recoverable and the purchaser
would be entitled to sell off the securities of the contractor and appropriate the sale
proceeds in or towards satisfaction of such claim and in case that is insufficient,
recover the balance by appropriating other sums due to the contractor and if there is
even then a shortfall, recover it personally from the contractor, for the last words of
cl. 18 provide that "the contractor shall on demand pay to the purchaser the balance
remaining due". And this consequence would ensue even if the claim is for a sum
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 28Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
which the -contractor is under no existing obligation to pay or which is not presently
payable or is disputed as regards the existence of liability or its quantum. A mere
making of a claim by the purchaser would impose a liability on the contractor to pay
it. That surely could -not have been the intention of the contracting parties. It would
be more consonant with reason and good sense to take the view, which, as pointed
out above, is plainly and indubitably supported by the language used by the
contracting parties, that cl. Is does no more than merely provide an additional mode
of recovery to the purchaser, and the purchaser is entitled to exercise the right
conferred, under that clause only where there is a claim for a sum which is presently
due and payable by the contractor."
In Fateh Chand Vs. Balkishan Dass (6 supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court held as under: (Paras 10
and 15).
"10. Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act deals with the measure of damages in two
classes of cases
(i) where the contract names a sum to be paid in case of breach and `ii) where the
contract contains any other stipulation by way of penalty. We are in the present case
not concerned to decide whether a covenant of forfeiture of deposit for due
performance of a contract falls within the first class. The measure of damages in the
case of breach of a stipulation by way of penalty is by s.
74 reasonable compensation not exceeding the penalty stipulated for. In assessing damages the
Court has, subject to the limit of the penalty stipulated, jurisdiction to award such compensation as
it deems reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of tile case. jurisdiction of the Court to
award compensation in case of breach of contract is unqualified except as to the maximum
stipulated; but compensation has to be reasonable, and that imposes upon the Court duty to award
compensation according, to settled principles. The section undoubtedly says that the aggrieved party
is entitled to receive compensation from the party who has broken the contract, whether or not
actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused by the breach. Thereby it merely dispenses with
proof of "actual loss or damages"; t does not justify the award of compensation when in consequence
of the breach no legal injury at all has resulted, because compensation for breach of contract can be
awarded to make good loss or damage which naturally arose in the usual course of things, or which
the parties knew when they made the contract, to be likely to result from the breach.
...
15. Section 74 declares the law as to liability upon breach of contract where compensation is by
agreement of the parties predetermined, or where there is a stipulation by way of penalty. But the
application of the enactment is not restricted to cases where the aggrieved party claims relief' as a
plaintiff. The section does not confer a special benefit upon any party; it merely declares the law that
notwithstanding any term in the contract predetermining damages or providing for forfeiture of any
property by way of penalty, the court will award to the party aggrieved only reasonable
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 29Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
compensation not exceeding the amount named or penalty stipulated. The jurisdiction of the court,
is not determined by the accidental circumstance of the party in default being a plaintiff or a
defendant in a suit. Use of the expression "to receive from the party who has broken the contract"
does not predicate that the jurisdiction of the court to adjust amounts which have been paid by the
party in default cannot be exercised in dealing with the claim of the party complaining of breach of
contract. The court has to adjudge in every case reasonable compensation to which the plaintiff is
entitled from the defendant on breach of the contract. Such compensation has to be ascertained
having regard to the conditions existing on the date of the breach."
26. In the considered opinion of this Court, the amounts awarded under claims 5 and 8, having
regard to the reasons assigned by the learned Arbitral Tribunal and the Special Judge, by any stretch
of imagination, cannot be termed to be unreasonable. The contention advanced by the learned
counsel for the appellant that since the Arbitral Tribunal awarded amounts under claim No.1 in the
form of price variation, the Tribunal ought not to have granted the reliefs under claims 5 and 8,
cannot be sustained in the eye of law, having regard to the language of the provisions of Sections 73
and 74 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.
Therefore, the judgments sought to be pressed into service by the leaned counsel for the appellant
would not render any assistance to the appellant herein in view of the facts and circumstances of the
case.
27. Coming to the judgments cited by the learned counsel for the 1st respondent-Contractor, in the
case of Associate Builders Vs. Delhi Development Authority (1 supra), the Hon'ble Apex Court at
paragraphs 2, 7 to 10, 12, 57 to 62, held as follows:
"2. The appellant herein was awarded a certain construction work contract by the
DDA vide a letter of award dated 14th May, 1992. DDA was building a colony
consisting of 7,000 houses in Trilok Puri in the trans-Yamuna area. 168 Middle
Income Group houses and 56 Lower Income Group houses, Grade-A Pocket- B
(balance work) was awarded for the tendered amount of Rs.87,66,678/-. The contract
was to be completed in 9 months. Admittedly, it was ultimately completed only in 34
months, the contractor completing 166 Middle Income Group houses and 36 Lower
Income Group houses. The total value of work that was done amounted to
Rs.62,84,845/-. As many as 15 claims were made by the contractor and the High
Court of Delhi appointed one Shri K.D. Bali to arbitrate the present dispute.
...
7. The Arbitrator by a reasoned award dated 23rd May, 2005 held that the entire
delay of 25 months in the execution of the project was thanks to the DDA, none of
this delay being attributable to the contractor. The learned Arbitrator found:
"That all the above four claims are inter linked being related to the overhead
expenses and therefore dealt together.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 30Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
That the date of commencement of work was 24.5.92 and the period for completion
was 9 months and therefore, the disputed date of completion was 23.2.93 but the
work could be actually completed on 28.3.95.
That there was delay of 25 months in completion of the work beyond the stipulated
date of completion.
That the Claimants urged that there had been various delays in the execution of work due to the
lapses and defaults of the Respondents from the very commencement of work. The progress was
held up time and again and the claimants therefore, as back as 17.2.93 advised the Respondents (C-9
page 167) that the Claimants are not interested to execute the work beyond the stipulated date of
completion and therefore, their contract be finalized on the stipulated date of completion as the
Claimants shall be exposed to incur heavy expenditure in overheads for maintaining establishment
watch and ward and tools and plants and other shuttering material but the Respondents did not
refute. The chief reasons for delay are highlighted below:-
I) Delay in supply of structural and architectural drawings.
II) That out of 9 Blocks 2 blocks are abnormally delayed as the site of the said 21 blocks was made
available in piecemeal which stretched till 26.2.94 whereas the stipulated completion was 23.2.93.
III) Delay in laying the conduit by the electrical agency resulting in delay in casting of RCC slab and
plastering work besides development work. The said hindrance was removed lastly on 28.3.95.
IV) Abnormal delay in making availability of the alignment sketch for electrical cables.
V) Inordinate delay in supply of stipulated material such as cement, steel and pipes.
VI) Delay in decision of finishing work in kitchen and bath rooms.
VII) There was inordinate delay in making availability of colour scheme.
VIII) That the Respondents also abnormally delayed the supply of door shutters which were to be
supplied by the Respondents. The same were supplied as late as 8.11.94.
IX) Inordinate delay in writing in the electrical conduits resulting in delay in completion of finishing
work.
X) Suspension of work by the Respondents for the period 17.1.94 to 25.2.94 and from 7.8.94 to
22.3.95 because of non-removal of hindrances.
XI) Delayed payment due to non-sanction of Administrative Approval and Expenditure Sanction.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 31Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
That all the delays as set out had been duly recorded 733 to 739 and M.A.S. register pages from 747
to 768 as highlighted by the Claimants. The Claimants also relied upon certain documents of MAS
Register supplied by the Respondents.
That the Claimants further stated that the Claimants had also filed reasons for delay and hold up of
the work various defaults of the Respondents in Annexure pages 740 to 746. The Claimants also
highlighted the correspondence made by the Claimants with Respondents.
That the Claimants further stated that the said hindrances were avoidable but the Respondents did
not take timely steps.
That the Claimants also referred the contents of the letter dated 10.7.95 (page 885) wherein it was
observed that the Superintending Engineer appreciated the working of the Claimants and also
observed that there was no fault of the contractor and they have successfully completed the work.
The Claimants further stated that, they had incurred heavy expenditure on overheads of the lapses
and default of the Respondents.
As against this the Respondents stated that there was poor planning of the claimants and also
contended that since the compensation has been levied under Clause 2 of the agreement therefore,
claim of the claimants deserves to be rejected.
That on record it is conclusively proved that the Respondents committed breach of contract as they
failed to discharge their obligations in time resulting in prolongations did not deny the deployment
of the tools and plants and machinery at site besides watch and ward during the prolongation."
8. It is important to note that before the Division Bench, the learned counsel for the DDA conceded
that this being a pure finding of fact, he would not be challenging it before the Division Bench.
9. Of the total claim of Rs.37.28 lakhs, the learned Arbitrator awarded an amount of Rs.23.39 lakhs.
Further, the learned Arbitrator has laboriously gone through all the evidence and answered each
claim giving reasons for the same.
10. By a judgment dated 3rd April, 2006, the learned Single Judge of the High Court of Delhi
dismissed the objections of the DDA and upheld the award. In an appeal filed under Section 37 of
the Arbitration Act, vide the impugned judgment dated 8th February, 2012, a Division Bench of the
High Court of Delhi set aside the judgment of the Single Judge on claims 9, 10, 11 and 15, and
negatived these claims in toto. Further, claims 12 and 13 were scaled down doing "rough and ready
justice". Resultantly, the awarded amount of Rs.7,20,000/- was scaled down to Rs. 5,57,137.50/-.
...
12. Mr. Amarendra Sharan, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the DDA has relied
strongly on clause 10C and clause 22 to support the judgment of the Division bench and has further
argued that there has been duplication so far as certain claims are concerned. He argued that an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 32Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
award in the teeth of clause 10C and clause 22 would be a jurisdictional error which would vitiate
the award.
...
57. We come now to the arguments of Mr. Sharan in support of the Division Bench judgment. The
learned counsel strongly relied on clause 10C and clause 22. These two clauses are set out as below:
Clause 10C of the agreement reads as follows:
"If during the progress of the works, the price of any material incorporated in the works, (not being
a material supplied from the Engineer- in-Charge's stores in accordance with Clause 10 hereof
and/or wages of labour increases as direct result of the coming into force of any fresh law, or
statutory rule or order (but not due to any changes in sales tax) and such increase exceed ten per
cent of the price and/or wages prevailing at the time of receipt of the tender for the work, and
contractor thereupon necessarily and properly pays in respect of the material (incorporated in the
work) such increased price and/or in respect of labour engaged on the execution of the work such
increased wages, then the amount of the contract shall accordingly be varied provided always that
any increase so payable is not, in the opinion of the Superintending Engineer (whose decision shall
be final and binding) attributable to delay in execution of the contract within the control of the
contractor. Provided, however, no reimbursements shall be made if the increase is not more than
10% of the said prices/wages and if so the reimbursements shall be made only on the excess over
10% and provided further that any such increase shall not be payable if such increase has become
operative after the contract or extended date of completion of the work in question.
If during the progress of the works, the price of any material incorporated in the works (not being a
material supplied from the Engineer- in-Charge's stores in accordance with Clause 10 hereof)
and/or wages of labour is decreased as a direct result of the coming into force of any fresh law or
statutory rule or order (but not due to any changes in sales tax) and such decrease exceeds ten per
cent of the prices and/or wages prevailing at the time of receipt of the tender for the work, Delhi
Development Authority shall in respect of materials incorporated in the work (not being materials
supplied from the Engineer-in-Charge's stores in accordance with Clause 10 hereof) and/or labour
engaged on the execution of the work after the date of coming into force of such law, statutory rule
or order be entitled to deduct from the dues of the contractor such amount as shall be equivalent of
difference between the prices of materials and/ or wages as they prevailed at the time of receipt of
tender for the work minus ten per cent thereof and the prices of materials and/ or wages of labour
on the coming into force of such law, statutory rule or order.
The contractor shall for the purpose of this condition keep such books of account and other
documents as are necessary to show the amount of any increase claimed or reduction available and
shall allow inspection of the same by a duly authorised representative of Delhi Development
Authority and further shall, at the request of the Engineer- in-Charge furnish, verified in such a
manner as the Engineer-in-Charge may require. Any document, so kept and such other information
as the Engineer-in-Charge may require.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 33Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
The contractor shall, within a reasonable time of his becoming aware of any alteration in the prices
of any such materials and/ or wages of labour give notice thereof to the Engineer-in- Charge stating
that the same is given in pursuance to the condition together with all information relating thereto
which he may be in a position to supply."
Clause 22 reads as follows:
"All sums payable by way of compensations under any of these conditions shall be, considered as
reasonable compensation to be applied to this use of Delhi Development Authority without
reference to the actual loss or damage sustained, and whether or not any damage shall have been
sustained.
Specifications and Conditions:
1. The contractor must get acquainted with the proposed site for the works and study specifications
and conditions carefully before tendering. The work shall be executed as per programme approved
by the Engineer-in-Charge. If part of site is not available for any reasons or there is some
unavoidable delay in supply of materials stipulated by the Departments, the programme of
construction shall be modified accordingly and the contractor shall have no claim for any extras or
compensation on this account."
58. Clause 10C concerns itself with the price of material incorporated in the works or wage or labour
increases. It has been seen that claims 9, 10 and 11 have nothing to do with either of the aforesaid
subjects. In seeking to apply this clause to claim 15, the simple answer is that this clause will not
apply when a claim for damages is made. Further, the Arbitrator considered this clause in detail and
only awarded amounts under this clause in excess of 10 percent as required by the clause when it
came to awarding amounts under claims 2, 3 and 4, which fell within the ambit of clause 10C. The
DDA in the appeal before the Division Bench correctly gave up any challenge to these claims as has
been recorded in paragraph 4 of the order under appeal.
59. The Arbitrator has dealt with this clause in detail and has construed and applied the same
correctly while dealing with claims 2, 3 and 4 and has obviously not applied the said clause to claims
9, 10, 11 and 15 as no occasion for applying the same arose. The award cannot be faulted on this
ground.
60. Also, so far as clause 22 is concerned, the DDA did not raise any argument based on this clause
before the learned Arbitrator. However, it must in fairness be stated that it was argued before the
learned Single Judge. In para 15 of his judgment, the learned Judge sets the clause out and then
follows a judgment of the High Court of Delhi in Kochhar Construction Works v. DDA & Anr.,
(1998) 2 Arb. LR 209. Apart from the fact that a learned Single Judge of the same court is bound by
a previous judgment of a Single Judge, the conclusion of the learned Single Judge that if the
appellant is at fault and the contract is prolonged for an inordinate period of time, it cannot be said
that the respondents cannot be compensated for the same is correct. Besides, this point was not
urged before the Division Bench and must be taken to be given up. Mr. Sharan cited Harsha
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 34Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
Constructions v. Union of India & Ors., (2014) 9 SCC 246 to say that in respect of excepted matters,
no arbitration is possible, and that this being a jurisdictional point, he should be allowed to raise it
before us. Unfortunately for Mr. Sharan, the clause does not operate automatically. It only operates
if an objection is taken stating that part of the site is not available for any reason. Nowhere has the
DDA stated which part of the site is not available for any reason. Further, the learned Single Judge's
reason for rejecting an argument based on this clause also commends itself to us as the object of this
clause is that no claim for extras should be granted only if there is an unavoidable delay. We have
seen that the delay was entirely avoidable and caused solely by the DDA itself.
61. One more point needs to be noted. An argument was made before the learned Single Judge that
there has been a duplication of claims awarded. The learned Judge dealt with this argument as
follows:
"18. Learned counsel for the petitioner in respect of ground P, once again makes a reference to the
issue that there is overlapping of the claim. I am unable to accept the submission made by the
learned counsel. The consequence of delay may have more than one ramifications including the cost
of material the supervision required at the site, the inability of the contractor to utilise the
manpower at some other place, the inability of the contractor to make, profits from some other
contract by utilisation of the same resources. All these aspects are liable to be considered. The
Arbitrator has considered the claims separately and has dealt with, claims 9, 10, 11 & 15 together.
Claims 12 & 13 have been thereafter dealt with on the same principles since it was found that it was
not the respondent, who was responsible for the delay for a period of 25 months beyond the
stipulated condition of 9 months.
There is thus no question of overlapping in different heads and the grievance of the petitioner is
rejected."
62. The Single Judge is clearly right. We have gone through all the 15 claims supplied to us and we
find that none of these claims are in fact overlapping. They are all contained under separate heads.
This argument, therefore, must also fail.
The law laid down in Central Bank of India Vs. Virudhunagar Steel Rolling Mills Limited and others
(10 supra), in the considered opinion of this Court, is squarely applicable to the case on hand.
28. Findings on Claims 4 and 7: Respondent No.1 claimed under claim No.4, a sum of
Rs.1,19,30,185-75 ps plus service tax and interest and respondent No.1 claimed the said amount
towards expenditure met by him in executing 12 number of extra items. Under claim No.7 i.e.
fixation of higher BOQ rates for the additional scope of work entrusted to the claimant for JH 44A to
JH 49A and making payment thereof, respondent No.1 herein claimed a sum of Rs.44,00,714.48 ps.
Against claim No.4, the Arbitral Tribunal granted Rs.79,27,943/- + service tax and interest, and
against claim No.7, the Arbitral Tribunal granted Rs.23,33,236/- + service tax and interest.
29. The principal contention advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant as regards these
claims is, in view of clause 21.3 of the General Conditions of Contract, these claims are excepted
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 35Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
matters, as such, the contractor is not entitled for the said claims and the Arbitral Tribunal has no
jurisdiction to entertain these claims for arbitration under Clause 28 of the General Conditions of
Contract. In this context, it may be appropriate to refer to clause 21.0 of the Special Conditions of
Contract, which reads as under:
"EXCEPTED MATTERS :
In the above clauses, wherever it is mentioned that the
decision/instructions/opinions of the Engineer/Employer will be final/binding and
are conclusive, these will also be treated as excepted matters as defined in General
Conditions of Contract."
The Tribunal, while dealing with these claims, categorically found that having breached the contract,
it would not be open for the appellant herein to take the plea of the excepted matters. Learned
Special Judge, by placing reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mc Dermott
International INC Vs. Burn Standard Co. Ltd., and others reported in (2006) 11 SCC 181 and Hind
Construction Contractors by its Sole Proprietor Bhikamchand Mulchand Jain (Dead) by LRs. Vs.
State of Maharashtra reported in AIR 1979 Supreme Court 720, also turned down the plea of the
appellant Company, as regards the plea of the excepted matters. Clause 26.3 of the General
Conditions of Contract reads as follows:
"Clause 26.3 : Valuation at the date of termination of Contract: The Engineer shall as
soon as may be practicable after any such entry and expulsion by the Employer fix
and determine ex-party or by or after reference to the parties or after such
investigation or enquiries as he may think fit to make or institute and shall certify
what amount (if any) had at the time of such entry and expulsion been reasonably
earned by or would reasonably accrue to the Contractor in respect of work then
actually done by him under the Contract and what was the value of any unused or
partially used materials, any Constructional plant and Temporary works which have
been deemed to become the property of the Employer Under Clause No.9.29 herein
above upon the Site."
30. In support of his contentions and submissions, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
appellant seeks to place reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of M/s.
Mitra Guha Builders (India) Company Vs. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (7 supra). In the
said judgment, paragraphs 16 to 29 read as under:
"16. In order to appreciate the claim of ONGC in levying the damages in terms of
Clause 2, it is necessary to refer to Clause 2 of the agreement which reads as under:-
"Clause 2: Compensation for Delay The time allowed for carrying out the work as entered in the
tender shall be strictly observed by the contractor and shall be deemed to be the essence of the
contract on the part of the contractor and shall be reckoned from the 15th day after the date on
which the order to commence the work is issued to the contractor. The work shall throughout the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 36Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
stipulated period of the contract be proceeded with all due diligence and the contractor shall pay
compensation on amount equal to ½ % per week as the Superintending Engineer (whose decision in
writing shall be final) may decide on the amount of the contract, value of the whole work as shown
in the agreement, for every week that the work remains uncommenced, or unfinished, after the
proper dates. After further to ensure good progress during the execution of the work, the contractor
shall be bound in all cases in which the time allowed for any work exceeds, one month (save the
special jobs) to complete one-eighth of the work, before one-fourth of the whole time allowed under
the contract has elapsed and three- eights of the work, before one-half of such time has elapsed, and
three-fourth of such time has elapsed. However, for special jobs if a time schedule has been
submitted by the contractor and the same has been accepted by the Engineer-in-Charge, the
Contractor shall comply with the said time schedule. In the event of the contractor failing to comply
with this condition, he shall be liable to pay as compensation an amount equal to ½ % per week as
the Superintending Engineer (whose decision in writing shall be final) may decide on the said
contract value if the whole work for every week that the due quantity of works remains incomplete
provided always that the entire amount of compensation to be paid under the provisions of the
clause shall not exceed ten per cent (10%) of the tendered cost of the work as shown in the tender."
[Emphasis added]
17. A reading of Clause 2 makes it clear that the Superintending Engineer has been conferred with
not only a right to levy compensation; but it also provides a mechanism for determination of the
liability/quantum of compensation. The very Clause 2 itself would show that such a decision taken
by the Superintending Engineer shall be final. The finality clause in the contract in terms of Clause 2
makes the intention of the parties very clear that there cannot be any further dispute on the said
issue between the parties; much less before the arbitrator.
18. Clause 25 of the agreement - Settlement of disputes by Arbitration, reads as under:-
"Clause 25 - Settlement of disputes by Arbitration If any dispute, difference, question or
disagreement shall, at any time, hereafter arises between the parties hereto or the respective
representatives or assigns in connection with or arising out of the contract, or in respect of meaning
of specifications, design, drawings, estimates, scheduled, annexures, orders, instructions, the
construction, interpretation of this agreement, application of provisions thereof or anything
hereunder containing or arising hereunder or as to rights, liabilities or duties of the said parties
hereunder or arising hereunder any matter whatsoever incidental to this contract or otherwise
concerning the works of execution or failure to execute the same whether during the progress of
work or stipulated/extended period or before or after the completion or abandonment thereof shall
be referred to the sole arbitration of the person appointed by a Director of ONGC Ltd. at the time of
dispute. There will be no objection to any such appointment that the arbitrator so appointed is an
employee of ONGC Ltd. or that he had to deal with the matters to which the contract relates and that
in the course of this duties as ONGC Ltd. employees, lie had expressed views on all or any of the
matters in dispute or difference. If the arbitrator to whom the matter is originally referred dies or
refuses to act or resigns for any reason from the position of arbitrator, it shall be lawful for the
Director of ONGC Ltd. to appoint another person to act as arbitrator in the manner aforesaid. Such
person shall be entitled to proceed with the reference from the stage at which it was left by his
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 37Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
predecessor if both the parties consent to this effect, failing which the arbitrator will be entitled to
proceed de-novo. ...........
It is also a term of the contract that if the contractor(s) do/does not make any demand for
arbitration in respect of any claim(s) in writing within 90 days of receiving the intimation from the
corporation that the bill is ready for payment, the claim of the contractor(s) will be deemed to have
been waived and absolutely barred and the Corporation shall be discharged and released of all
liabilities under the contract in respect of these claims.
The decision of the Superintending Engineer regarding the quantum of reduction as well as his
justification in respect of reduced rates for sub-standard work, which may be decided to be accepted,
will be final and would not be open to arbitration. ...........". [Emphasis added]
19. The intention of the parties to exclude some of the decisions of the Superintending Engineer
from the purview of arbitration is clearly seen from the abovesaid clause. Claim No.6 made by the
appellant is to declare that the penalty imposed by ONGC under Clause 2 was illegal and
unwarranted and the amount withheld by ONGC was payable to the appellant. The very prayer to
declare the amount levied by the Superintending Engineer as illegal is against the tenor of the terms
of the contract (Clause 2) between the parties. By virtue of the finality clause in the contract, any
decision taken by the Superintending Engineer in levying compensation cannot be referred to an
arbitrator. The parties have consciously agreed to have finality to the decision of the Superintending
Engineer and the same cannot be frustrated by challenging the same as illegal. Any other meaning to
the finality clause in the contract and allowing further adjudication by another authority would
make the agreed Clause 2 and Clause 25 of the agreement meaningless and redundant.
20. As held by the Division Bench of the High Court, whether there was delay in completion of work
and the levy of liquated damages, could not have been determined by the arbitrator. Vide letters
dated 08.12.1999, 09.12.1999, 17.12.1999, 11.02.2000 and 17.04.2000, ONGC called upon the
respondent/contractor to remove the defects failing which it would get the defects remedied at his
cost. According to ONGC, the completion time was extended without prejudice to the right of ONGC
to recover compensation in accordance with Clause 2 of the agreement. The contention of ONGC is
that by the letter dated 15.05.2001, the contractor was put on notice that in exercise of the power
conferred on the Superintending Engineer under Clause 2, the contractor is liable to pay 10% of the
contract value by way of compensation. The contractor was informed by the said letter dated
15.05.2001 that the compensation is levied on him for the period of 39 weeks at half per cent per
week subject to maximum of 10% of the contract value and that the actual amount of compensation
shall be worked out on checking the final bill and the same shall be recovered by ONGC from the
final bill. By the subsequent letter dated 25.05.2001, the claimant was informed that the final bill is
ready and the claimant was required to reconcile the final bill after adjusting the compensation.
21. A reading of the other terms of the contract would further indicate that under Clauses 13 and 14
of the agreement, the parties have agreed for payment of compensation and non-payment of
compensation in certain situations. Significantly, Clauses 13 and 14 of the agreement do not have
any finality clause which indicates that any dispute arising out of such clauses may be a dispute
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 38Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
referable to arbitration. However, in respect of levy of compensation for the delay, Clause 2 of the
agreement specifically makes the decision of the Superintending Engineer, final. The entire contract
between the parties and the terms thereon have to be read as a whole to decide the rights and
liabilities of the parties arising out of the contract. In claim No.6, the contractor has sought for
declaration "that the penalty under Clause 2 imposed by ONGC was illegal and unwarranted and the
amount withheld by ONGC was payable to the contractor with interest @ 24%". Claim No.6 sought
for by the contractor is clearly in violation of Clause 2 of the agreement between the parties, in and
by which, the parties have agreed that the decision taken by the Superintending Engineer levying
compensation shall be final. The finality clause in the contract cannot therefore be frustrated by
calling upon the arbitrator to decide on the correctness of levy of compensation by the
Superintending Engineer.
22. While considering similar contractual provisions viz. Clause 2 of the agreement as in the present
case, in Vishwanath Sood v. Union of India and Another (1989) 1 SCC 657, the Supreme Court held
as under:-
"8. ......... As we see it, clause 2 contains a complete machinery for determination of the
compensation which can be claimed by the Government on the ground of delay on the part of the
contractor in completing the contract as per the time schedule agreed to between the parties. The
decision of the Superintending Engineer, it seems to us, is in the nature of a considered decision
which he has to arrive at after considering the various mitigating circumstances that may be pleaded
by the contractor or his plea that he is not liable to pay compensation at all under this clause. In our
opinion the question regarding the amount of compensation leviable under clause 2 has to be
decided only by the Superintending Engineer and no one else.
9. ........After referring to certain judicial decisions regarding the meaning of the word "final" in
various statutes, the Division Bench concluded that the finality cannot be construed as excluding the
jurisdiction of the arbitrator under Clause 25. We are unable to accept this view. Clause 25 which is
the arbitration clause starts with an opening phrase excluding certain matters and disputes from
arbitration and these are matters or disputes in respect of which provision has been made elsewhere
or otherwise in the contract. These words in our opinion can have reference only to provisions such
as the one in parenthesis in clause 2 by which certain types of determinations are left to the
administrative authorities concerned. If that be not so, the words "except where otherwise provided
in the contract" would become meaningless. We are therefore inclined to hold that the opening part
of clause 25 clearly excludes matters like those mentioned in clause 2 in respect of which any dispute
is left to be decided by a higher official of the Department. Our conclusion, therefore, is that the
question of awarding compensation under clause 2 is outside the purview of the arbitrator and that
the compensation, determined under clause 2 either by the Engineer-in-charge or on further
reference by the Superintending Engineer will not be capable of being called in question before the
arbitrator.
10. ....... But we should like to make it clear that our decision regarding non-arbitrability is only on
the question of any compensation which the Government might claim in terms of Clause 2 of the
contract. We have already pointed out that this is a penalty clause introduced under the contract to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 39Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
ensure that the time schedule is strictly adhered to. It is something which the Engineer-in-charge
enforces from time to time when he finds that the contractor is being recalcitrant, in order to ensure
speedy and proper observance of the terms of the contract. This is not an undefined power. The
amount of compensation is strictly limited to a maximum of 10 per cent and with a wide margin of
discretion to the Superintending Engineer, who might not only reduce the percentage but who, we
think, can even reduce it to nil, if the circumstances so warrant. It is this power that is kept outside
the scope of arbitration. We would like to clarify that this decision of ours will not have any
application to the claims, if any, for loss or damage which it may be open to the Government to lay
against the contractor, not in terms of clause 2 but under the general law or under the Contract Act.
As we have pointed out at the very outset so far as this case is concerned the claim of the
Government has obviously proceeded in terms of clause 2 and that is the way in which both the
learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench have also approached the question. Reading
clauses 2 and 25 together we think that the conclusion is irresistible that the amount of
compensation chargeable under clause 2 is a matter which has to be adjudicated in accordance with
that clause and which cannot be referred to arbitration under clause 25". [Underlining added]
23. The ratio of the above decision squarely applies to the present case. Once the parties have
decided that certain matters are to be decided by the Superintending Engineer and his decision
would be final, the same cannot be the subject matter of arbitration.
24. In this regard, reliance was also placed upon Food Corporation of India v. Sreekanth Transport
(1999) 4 SCC 491 wherein, the Supreme Court interpreted Clause 12 of the agreement thereon.
Clause 12 of the agreement in Food Corporation of India reads as under:-
"The decisions of the Senior Regional Manager regarding such failure of the contractors and their
liability for the losses etc. suffered by the Corporation shall be final and binding on the
contractors....".
25. While interpreting the clause on 'excepted matters', in Food Corporation of India, the Supreme
Court held as under:- "3. "Excepted matters" obviously, as the parties agreed, do not require any
further adjudication since the agreement itself provides a named adjudicator -- concurrence to the
same obviously is presumed by reason of the unequivocal acceptance of the terms of the contract by
the parties and this is where the courts have been found out lacking in their jurisdiction to entertain
an application for reference to arbitration as regards the disputes arising therefrom and it has been
the consistent view that in the event of the claims arising within the ambit of excepted matters, the
question of assumption of jurisdiction of any arbitrator either with or without the intervention of the
court would not arise. The parties themselves have decided to have the same adjudicated by a
particular officer in regard to these matters; what these exceptions are however are questions of fact
and usually mentioned in the contract documents and form part of the agreement and as such there
is no ambiguity in the matter of adjudication of these specialised matters and being termed in the
agreement as the excepted matters.
........
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 40Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
9. ......... The Food Corporation, therefore, as a matter of fact desired an adjudication of their claim
to the extent of Rs 1,89,775 together with interest at the rate of 18 per cent per annum from the civil
court rather than relying on the adjudicatory process available in the contract itself through their
own Senior Regional Manager. The agreement as noticed above expressly provides that the
adjudication shall be effected by the Senior Regional Manager and by no other authority and the
decision, it has been recorded in the agreement, of the Senior Regional Manager would be final and
binding on the parties.....".
26. In the present case, the parties themselves have agreed that the decision of the Superintending
Engineer in levying compensation is final and the same is an "excepted matter" and the
determination shall be only by the Superintending Engineer and the correctness of his decision
cannot be called in question in the arbitration proceedings and the remedy if any, will arise in the
ordinary course of law.
27. The learned counsel for the appellant has relied upon Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and
another v. Motorola India (P) Ltd. (2009) 2 SCC 337 and by referring to Clause 16(2) in the
concerned agreement submitted that for quantification of liquidated damages, first of all, there has
to be a delay and for ascertaining as to who was responsible for the delay, such an issue will be
within the jurisdiction of the arbitrator. The learned ASG however, submitted that in the present
case, Clause 2 of the agreement is not only a mechanism for quantification of liquidated damages,
but Clause 2 also makes the contractor liable for payment of the same and in terms of Clause 2 of the
agreement, the decision of the Superintending Engineer is final and the present case is therefore,
distinguishable from BSNL's case.
28. As rightly contended by the learned ASG, in BSNL's case, Clause 16(2) of the agreement does not
create any kind of liability to pay liquidated damages; but only provides for entitlement of BSNL to
collect the damages in case of any delay in supply on the part of the supplier under Clause 16(2).
While interpreting Clause 16(2) and Clause 21 of the contract which was under consideration in
BSNL's case, in paras (23) and (26), the Supreme Court held as under:-
"23. The question to be decided in this case is whether the liability of the respondent to pay
liquidated damages and the entitlement of the appellants, to collect the same from the respondent is
an excepted matter for the purpose of Clause 20.1 of the general conditions of contract. The High
Court has pointed out correctly that the authority of the purchaser (BSNL) to quantify the liquidated
damages payable by the supplier Motorola arises once it is found that the supplier is liable to pay the
damages claimed. The decision contemplated under Clause 16.2 of the agreement is the decision
regarding the quantification of the liquidated damages and not any decision regarding the fixing of
the liability of the supplier. It is necessary as a condition precedent to find that there has been a
delay on the part of the supplier in discharging his obligation for delivery under the agreement.
...........
Quantification of liquidated damages may be an excepted matter as argued by the appellants, under
Clause 16.2, but for the levy of liquidated damages, there has to be a delay in the first place. In the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 41Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
present case, there is a clear dispute as to the fact that whether there was any delay on the part of the
respondent. For this reason, it cannot be accepted that the appointment of the arbitrator by the
High Court was unwarranted in this case. Even if the quantification was excepted as argued by the
appellants under Clause 16.2, this will only have effect when the dispute as to the delay is
ascertained. Clause 16.2 cannot be treated as an excepted matter because of the fact that it does not
provide for any adjudicatory process for decision on a question, dispute or difference, which is the
condition precedent to lead to the stage of quantification of damages."
29. In BSNL's case, Clause 16 provided for entitlement of the party to recover liquidated damages. In
Clause 16(2), the phrases used "value of delayed quantity" and "for each week of delay" clearly show
that it is necessary to find out whether there has been delay on the part of the supplier in
discharging his obligation. Thus, in BSNL's case, in determining whether there is delay or not, a
process of adjudication is envisaged. Per contra, in the present case, Clause 2 of the agreement is a
complete mechanism for determination of liability. The right to levy damages for delay is exclusively
conferred upon the Superintending Engineer and Clause 2 of the present agreement is a complete
mechanism for determination of liability and when such compensation is levied by the
Superintending Engineer, the same is final and binding. The parties have also consciously agreed
that for the delay caused, the Superintending Engineer shall levy the compensation of the amount
equal to half per cent and the said amount shall not exceed from 10% of the cost of the work and the
determination by the Superintending Engineer is final and cannot be the subject matter of
arbitration. In claim No.6, the prayer sought for by the contractor to declare the compensation
levied by the Superintending Engineer as illegal is contradictory to the agreed terms between the
parties. So far as the liquidated damages determined and levied, by virtue of Clause 2, is out of the
purview of the arbitration especially in view of the fact that under the very same clause, the parties
have agreed that the decision of the Superintending Engineer shall be final."
With due respect to the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court, in the contract, which fell for
consideration before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the above-referred judgment, there was a clause
in the contract which stipulated that the decision of the Engineer should be final, and in the instant
case, the same is not the contingency even as per clause No.21.3 of the General Conditions of
Contract. Therefore, the said judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court would not render any assistance
to the case of the appellant herein.
31. Coming to the judgments relied on, by the learned counsel for respondent No.1, in J.G.Engineers
Private Limited v. Union of India and another16, the Hon'ble Apex Court, at paragraphs 18 to 20, 22
to 24, held in the following manner.
"18. Thus what is made final and conclusive by clauses (2) and (3) of the agreement,
is not the decision of any authority on the issue whether the contractor was
responsible for the delay or the department was responsible for the delay or on the
question whether termination/rescission is valid or illegal. What is made final, is the
decisions on consequential issues relating to quantification, if there is no dispute as
to who committed breach. That is, if the contractor admits that he is in breach, or if
the Arbitrator finds that the contractor is in breach by being responsible for the delay,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 42Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
the decision of the Superintending Engineer will be final in regard to two issues. The
first is the percentage (whether it should be 1% or less) of the value of the work that is
to be levied as liquidated damages per day. The second is the determination of the
actual excess cost in getting the work completed through an alternative agency. The
decision as to who is responsible for the delay in execution and who committed
breach is not made subject to any decision of the respondents or its officers, nor
excepted from arbitration under any provision of the contract.
19. In fact the question whether the other party committed breach cannot be decided
by the party alleging breach. A contract cannot provide that one party will be the
arbiter to decide whether he committed breach or the other party committed breach.
That question can only be decided by only an adjudicatory forum, that is, a court or
an Arbitral Tribunal.
20. In State of Karnataka vs. Shree Rameshwara Rice Mills (1987 (2) SCC 160) this
Court held that adjudication upon the issue relating to a breach of condition of
contract and adjudication of assessing damages arising out of the breach are two
different and distinct concepts and the right to assess damages arising out of a breach
would not include a right to adjudicate upon as to whether there was any breach at
all. This Court held that one of the parties to an agreement cannot reserve to himself
the power to adjudicate whether the other party has committed breach. This court
held :
"Even assuming for argument's sake that the terms of Clause 12 afford scope for being construed as
empowering the officer of the State to decide upon the question of (2011) 5 SCC 758 breach as well
as assess the quantum of damages, we do not think that adjudication by the other officer regarding
the breach of the contract can be sustained under law because a party to the agreement cannot be an
arbiter in his own cause. Interests of justice and equity require that where a party to a contract
disputes the committing of any breach of conditions the adjudication should be by an independent
person or body and not by the other party to the contract. The position will, however, be different
where there is no dispute or there is consensus between the contracting parties regarding the breach
of conditions. In such a case the officer of the State, even though a party to the contract will be well
within his rights in assessing the damages occasioned by the breach in view of the specific terms of
Clause 12. We are, therefore, in agreement with the view of the Full Bench that the powers of the
State under an agreement entered into by it with a private person providing for assessment of
damages for breach of conditions and recovery of the damages will stand confined only to those
cases where the breach of conditions is admitted or it is not disputed." ...
22. In view of the above, the question whether appellant was responsible or respondents were
responsible for the delay in execution of the work, was arbitrable. The arbitrator has examined the
said issue and has recorded a categorical finding that the respondents were responsible for the delay
in execution of the work and the contractor was not responsible. The arbitrator also found that the
respondents were in breach and the termination of contract was illegal. Therefore, the respondents
were not entitled to levy liquidated damages nor entitled to claim from the contractor the extra cost
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 43Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
(including any escalation in regard to such extra cost) in getting the work completed through an
alternative agency. Therefore even though the decision as to the rate of liquidated damages and the
decision as to what was the actual excess cost in getting the work completed through an alternative
agency, were excepted matters, they were not relevant for deciding claims 1, 3 and 11, as the right to
levy liquidated damages or claim excess costs would arise only if the contractor was responsible for
the delay and was in breach.
23. In view of the finding of the arbitrator that the appellant was not responsible for the delay and
that the respondents were responsible for the delay, the question of respondents levying liquidated
damages or claiming the excess cost in getting the work completed as damages, does not arise. Once
it is held that the contractor was not responsible for the delay and the delay occurred only on
account of the omissions and commissions on the part of the respondents, it follows that provisions
which make the decision of the Superintending Engineer or the Engineer- in-Charge final and
conclusive, will be irrelevant. Therefore, the Arbitrator would have jurisdiction to try and decide all
the claims of the contractor as also the claims of the respondents. Consequently, the award of the
Arbitrator on items 1, 3 and 11 has to be upheld and the conclusion of the High Court that award in
respect of those claims had to be set aside as they related to excepted matters, cannot be sustained.
Re : Question (ii)
24. The arbitrator had considered and dealt with claims (1), (2, 4 and 5), (6), (7 and 8), (9) and (11)
separately and distinctly. The High Court found that the award in regard to items 1, 3, 5 and 11 were
liable to be set aside. The High Court did not find any error in regard to the awards on claims 2, 4, 6,
7, 8 and 9, but nevertheless chose to set aside the award in regard to these six items, only on the
ground that in the event of counter claims 1 to 4 were to be allowed by the arbitrator on
reconsideration, the respondents would have been entitled to adjust the amounts awarded in regard
to claims 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 towards the amounts that may be awarded in respect of counter claims 1
to 4; and that as the award on counter claims 1 to 4 was set aside by it and remanded for fresh
decision, the award in regard to claim Nos. 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 were also liable to be set aside."
In Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited & another v. Motorola India Private Limited17, it is held thus:
(paragraphs 5, 9, 18, 23 and 32).
" It is the case of the appellants that the respondent had failed to complete phase I
and phase II of the project within the schedule as provided in the tender document,
and therefore, liquidated damages were imposed by the Tamil Nadu Circle of the
appellant on 21st of May, 2004 under clause 16.2 of the tender document,
quantification of which was beyond the purview of the arbitration agreement.
...
The High Court, as noted herein earlier, by the impugned judgment allowed the
arbitration request of the respondents holding that the imposition of liquidated
damages by the appellant was not an "excepted matter" and therefore, subject to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 44Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
arbitration. It is this judgment of the High Court, which is impugned in this appeal,
in respect of which leave has already been granted.
...
(2009) 2 SCC 337 We may keep on record that the appellants alleged that
respondents had not completed phase I and phase II of the project within the
schedule as provided in the tender document whereupon the appellants had to
impose liquidated damages and invoke clause 16.2 of the tender document. But the
respondents refuted these allegations. The contention of the respondent in this case
was that the delay, if any, was caused due to the appellant's delay in supplying
necessary inputs to the respondent. So the respondent contends that it had
performed its part of the contract in time and the blame for delay lies on the
appellant. Thus it is to be noted that there is a dispute between the parties on the
question whether any breach was committed in this case.
...
The question to be decided in this case is whether the liability of the respondent to
pay Liquidated Damages and the entitlement of the appellant, to collect the same
from the respondent is an excepted matter for the purpose of clause 20.1 of the
General Conditions of contract. The High Court has pointed out correctly that the
authority of the purchaser (BSNL) to quantify the Liquidated Damages payable by the
supplier Motorolla arises once it is found that the supplier is liable to pay the
damages claimed. The decision contemplated under clause 16.2 of the agreement is
the decision regarding the quantification of the Liquidated Damages and not any
decision regarding the fixing of the liability of the supplier. It is necessary as a
condition precedent to find that there has been a delay on the part of the supplier in
discharging his obligation for delivery under the agreement.
...
In view of the discussions made hereinabove, we hold that the disputes raised by the
respondents are arbitrable and not excepted from the scope of arbitration."
32. In view of the above reasons, this Court finds sufficient force in the submission of the learned
counsel for respondent No.1 that having regard to clause 26.3 of the General Conditions of Contract,
contention of the appellant that these are excepted matters and there cannot be any claim for the
same in view of clause 21.3 of the General Conditions of Contract, is not tenable, and it cannot be
said that these claims are excepted matters. Therefore, this Court is not inclined to interfere with the
findings recorded by the Special Judge and the Arbitral Tribunal in respect of the claims 4 and 7 in
the absence of any patent illegality and in the absence of necessary requirements and contingencies
as stipulated under Section 34 of the Act, 1996.

33. Finding on Claim No.13:
Claim No.13 reads as follows:
Additional expenditures met by the claimant for development of fabrication site to the extent
possible as the allotted fabricated site area was slushy pond. Claim amount: Rs.4,15,000/- (+)
service tax and interest.
Against the abovesaid claim, the Arbitral Tribunal granted Rs.3,81,800/-. The essence of the stance
of the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant as regards this claim is that in view of
Clause 9.3 of the General Conditions of Contract, respondent No.1 is not entitled for any amount
under this head. In this connection, it would be apposite to refer to the said clause No.9.3 of the
General Conditions of Contract, which reads as follows:
"Clause No.9.3: Inspection of Site: The Contractor shall visit, inspect and examine the
Site and its surroundings and shall satisfy himself before submitting the Tender as to
the various facilities available at the Site for the receipt storage and custody of the
materials, as to the nature of the ground and sub-soils (as far as it is practicable) the
form and nature of the Site, the conditions, the quantities and nature of the work and
materials, facilities necessary for transportation, erection, testing and other works
and the means of access to the Site, the accommodation and other facilities that may
be required and, in general, shall himself obtain all necessary information as to the
working conditions, risk, contingencies and other circumstances which may influence
or affect his Tender. The Tenderer shall note that no claim on this ground will be
admissible."
The learned Arbitral Tribunal, while dealing with this claim, took into consideration the obligation
on the part of the employer to make available the land, free of charge, within and/or near the
employer's work site for the contractor to put up stores, site fabrication yard, office, etc. as required
for execution of the contract. The Tribunal also took into consideration the photographs depicting
the site conditions and found that it was not possible to be used for keeping the raw material, for
carrying out fabrication and stacking fabricated structures, and found further that movement of
heavy cranes was impossible and it was difficult event to walk. Having regard to the findings of the
learned Arbitral Tribunal, on factual situations, in the absence of any patent illegality, this Court is
not inclined to meddle with the Award rendered by the learned Arbitral Tribunal, as confirmed by
the learned Special Judge.
34. Finding on claim No.14: The sum and substance of the case of the appellant as regards this claim
is that in view of Clause 28.4 of the General Conditions of Contract read with Section 31(7) (a) of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, the Arbitral Tribunal has no jurisdiction to award the
interest. It is also the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that the Arbitral Tribunal
grossly erred in granting interest under the provisions of the MSMED Act, 2006 and the said Act
cannot be pressed into service and the Arbitral Tribunal being creature of the statute i.e. the 1996
Act, it cannot usurp the jurisdiction of the Facilitation Council as per the MSMED Act, 2006. In this
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 46Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
context, it may be appropriate to refer Clause 28.4 of the General Conditions of Contract.
"Clause 28.4: No interest shall be awarded by the Arbitrator in any Arbitration
proceedings."
35. In order to adjudicate claim No.14, it would also be appropriate to refer to the provisions of the
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006. The said legislation, enacted by the
Parliament, came into force on 18.07.2006, and the Parliament brought the said legislation to
provide for facilitating the promotion and development and enhancing the competitiveness of
micro, small and medium enterprises and the matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.
Section 2(d) and (n) of the Act, 2006 define the terms 'buyer' and 'supplier' and the said provisions
of law read as follows:
"Section 2(d): "Buyer" means whoever buys any goods or receives any services from a supplier for
consideration.
Section 2(n): "Supplier" means a micro or small enterprise, which has filed a memorandum with the
authority referred to in sub-section (1) of section 8, and includes,--
(i) the National Small Industries Corporation, being a company, registered under the Companies
Act, 1956 (1 of 1956);
(ii) the Small Industries Development Corporation of a State or a Union territory, by whatever name
called, being a company registered under the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956);
(iii) any company, co-operative society, trust or a body, by whatever name called, registered or
constituted under any law for the time being in force and engaged in selling goods produced by
micro or small enterprises and rendering services which are provided by such enterprises;"
Sections 15 to 18 of the said enactment read as under:
"Section 15: Liability of buyer to make payment.-- Where any supplier supplies any goods or renders
any services to any buyer, the buyer shall make payment therefor on or before the date agreed upon
between him and the supplier in writing or, where there is no agreement in this behalf, before the
appointed day: Provided that in no case the period agreed upon between the supplier and the buyer
in writing shall exceed forty-five days from the day of acceptance or the day of deemed acceptance.
Section 16: Date from which and rate at which interest is payable.--Where any buyer fails to make
payment of the amount to the supplier, as required under section 15, the buyer shall,
notwithstanding anything contained in any agreement between the buyer and the supplier or in any
law for the time being in force, be liable to pay compound interest with monthly rests to the supplier
on that amount from the appointed day or, as the case may be, from the date immediately following
the date agreed upon, at three times of the bank rate notified by the Reserve Bank.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 47Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
Section 17. Recovery of amount due.--For any goods supplied or services rendered by the supplier,
the buyer shall be liable to pay the amount with interest thereon as provided under section 16.
Section 18. Reference to Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council.--
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, any party to a
dispute may, with regard to any amount due under section 17, make a reference to the Micro and
Small Enterprises Facilitation Council.
(2) On receipt of a reference under sub-section (1), the Council shall either itself conduct
conciliation in the matter or seek the assistance of any institution or centre providing alternate
dispute resolution services by making a reference to such an institution or centre, for conducting
conciliation and the provisions of sections 65 to 81 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26
of 1996) shall apply to such a dispute as if the conciliation was initiated under Part III of that Act.
(3) Where the conciliation initiated under sub-section (2) is not successful and stands terminated
without any settlement between the parties, the Council shall either itself take up the dispute for
arbitration or refer it to any institution or centre providing alternate dispute resolution services for
such arbitration and the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996) shall
then apply to the dispute as if the arbitration was in pursuance of an arbitration agreement referred
to in sub-section (1) of section 7 of that Act.
(4) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, the Micro and
Small Enterprises Facilitation Council or the centre providing alternate dispute resolution services
shall have jurisdiction to act as an Arbitrator or Conciliator under this section in a dispute between
the supplier located within its jurisdiction and a buyer located anywhere in India.
(5) Every reference made under this section shall be decided within a period of ninety days from the
date of making such a reference."
Section 24 of the said Act reads as follows:
Section 24. Overriding effect.--The provisions of sections 15 to 23 shall have effect notwithstanding
anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force.
36. While referring to the provisions of Section 16 of the said Act, it is submitted by the learned
counsel for respondent No.1 that respondent No.1 is entitled for interest as stipulated under Section
16 of the MSMED Act, 2006, i.e., three times of the bank rate. In terms of the said legislation, the
Arbitral Tribunal granted interest in favour of respondent No.1 herein. To substantiate his
submission as regards the applicability of this enactment, learned counsel for respondent No.1
places reliance on the judgment of the Bombay High Court in M/s. Steel Authority of India Ltd., and
another Vs. Micro, Small Enterprise Facilitation Council, through Joint Director of Industries,
Nagpur Region, Nagpur reported in AIR 2012 Bombay 178. Relevant portion of the said judgment at
paragraph 11, reads as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 48Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
"11. Having considered the matter, we find that Section 18 (1) of the Act, in terms
allows any party to a dispute relating to the amount due under Section 17 i.e. an
amount due and payable by buyer to seller; to approach the facilitation Council. It is
rightly contended by Mrs. Dangre, the learned Addl. Government Pleader, that there
can be variety of disputes between the parties such as about the date of acceptance of
the goods or the deemed day of acceptance, about schedule of supplies etc. because of
which a buyer may have a strong objection to the bills raised by the supplier in which
case a buyer must be considered eligible to approach the Council. We find that
Section 18(1) clearly allows any party to a dispute namely a buyer and a supplier to
make reference to the Council. However, the question is; what would be the next step
after such a reference is made, when an arbitration agreement exists between the
parties or not. We find that there is no provision in the Act, which negates or renders
an arbitration agreement entered into between the parties ineffective. Moreover,
Section 24 of the Act, which is enacted to give an overriding effect to the provisions of
Section 15 to 23-including section 18, which provides for forum for resolution of the
dispute under the Act-would not have the effect of negating an arbitration agreement
since that section overrides only such things that are inconsistent with Section 15 to
23 including Section 18 notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the
time being in force. Section 18(3) of the Act in terms provides that where conciliation
before the Council is not successful, the Council may itself take the dispute for
arbitration or refer it to any institution or centre providing alternate dispute
resolution and that the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 shall
thus apply to the disputes as an arbitration in pursuance of arbitration agreement
referred to in Section 7 (1) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. This
procedure for arbitration and conciliation is precisely the procedure under which all
arbitration agreements are dealt with.
We, thus find that it cannot be said that because Section 18 provides for a forum of
arbitration an independent arbitration agreement entered into between the parties
will cease to have effect. There is no question of an independent arbitration
agreement ceasing to have any effect because the overriding clause only overrides
things inconsistent therewith and there is no inconsistency between an arbitration
conducted by the Council under Section 18 and arbitration conducted under an
individual clause since both are governed by the provision of the Arbitration Act,
1996."
37. According to the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant, since the Arbitral Tribunal,
in the instant case, exercised the jurisdiction under the provisions of the 1996 Act, the Tribunal is
bound by the terms of the contract and Sections 37 and 31 (7) (a) of the 1996 Act. It is not in dispute
that as per Clause 28.4 of the General Conditions of Contract, as referred to, supra, grant of interest
by the Arbitral Tribunal, is prohibited. Section 31(7) (a) of the Act, 1996 reads as follows:
"Section 31 (7) (a): Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, where and in so far as an
arbitral award is for the payment of money, the arbitral tribunal may include in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 49Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
sum for which the award is made interest, at such rate as it deems reasonable, on the
whole or any part of the money, for the whole or any part of the period between the
date on which the cause of action arose and the date on which the award is made."
38. Admittedly, in the instant case, there is a condition in the form of Clause 28.4 of the General
Conditions of Contract, which bars the grant of interest by the Arbitral Tribunal. Therefore, this
Court finds sufficient force in the submission of the learned senior counsel appearing for the
appellant that in view of Section 31(7)(a) of the Act, 1996 read with Clause 28.4 of the General
Conditions of Contract, the Arbitral Tribunal is prohibited from granting interest. In the considered
opinion of this Court, the provisions of the MSMED Act, 2006, cannot be made applicable to the
arbitration proceedings initiated under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. In the considered
opinion of this Court, the judgment sought to be relied upon by the learned counsel for respondent
No.1 in M/s. Steel Authority of India Ltd., and another Vs. Micro, Small Enterprise Facilitation
Council, through Joint Director of Industries, Nagpur Region, Nagpur reported in AIR 2012 Bombay
178 would not render any assistance to respondent No.1 herein to sustain its stand on claim No.14.
In this context, it may be appropriate to refer to the judgments cited by the learned Senior Counsel
appearing for the appellant.
(a) in Union of India v. Ambica Construction (8 supra), wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held
thus: (paragraphs 25 to 28) "25. A 3-Judge Bench of this Court in Union of India v. Bright Power
Projects (India) Pvt. Ltd. (2015) 9 SCC 695 has considered the provisions contained in section
31(7)(a) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and considered the words "unless otherwise
agreed by parties" in the said section and held that the Arbitrator is bound by the terms of the
contract so far as award of interest from the date of execution to the date of award is concerned. This
Court considered clause 13(3) of the contract and came to the conclusion that once agreed that
contractor would not claim any interest on the amount to be paid under the contract, he could not
have claimed the interest. The Arbitrator while awarding interest failed to consider the provisions of
section 31(7)(a) and binding nature of clause 13(3) of the terms of agreement. With respect to
section 31(7)(a) of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 this Court in Union of India v. Bright
Power Projects (supra) has observed thus :
"18. Section 31(7)(a) of the Act ought to have been read and interpreted by the Arbitral Tribunal
before taking any decision with regard to awarding interest. The said section, which has been
reproduced hereinabove, gives more respect to the agreement entered into between the parties. If
the parties to the agreement agree not to pay interest to each other, the Arbitral Tribunal has no
right to award interest pendente lite." Section 31(7)(a) of the 1996 Act confers power on Arbitrator
to award interest pendente lite, "unless otherwise agreed by parties". Thus, it is clear from the
provisions contained in section 31(7)(a) that the contract between the parties has been given
importance and is binding on the Arbitrator. Arbitration clause is also required to be looked into
while deciding the power of the Arbitrator and in case there is any bar contained in the contract on
award of interest, it operates on which items and in the arbitration clause what are the powers
conferred on Arbitrator and whether bar on award of interest has been confined to certain period or
it relates to pendency of proceedings before Arbitrator.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 50Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
26. In Sree Kamatchi Amman Constructions (supra), it was observed that the words "unless
otherwise agreed by the parties" in section 31 of new Act of 1996 clarify that Arbitrator is bound by
the terms of contract for award of interest pendente lite. It was also held thus :
"19. Section 31(7) of the new Act by using the words "unless otherwise agreed by the parties"
categorically clarifies that the Arbitrator is bound by the terms of the contract insofar as the award
of interest from the date of cause of action to the date of award. Therefore, where the parties had
agreed that no interest shall be payable, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot award interest between the
date when the cause of action arose to the date of award.
20. We are of the view that the decisions in Engineers-De- Space-Age (supra) and Madnani (supra)
are inapplicable for yet another reason. In Engineers- De-Space-Age (supra) and Madnani (supra)
the Arbitrator had awarded interest for the pendente lite period. This Court upheld the award of
such interest under the old Act on the ground that the Arbitrator had the discretion to decide
whether interest should be awarded or not during the pendente lite period and he was not bound by
the contractual terms insofar as the interest for the pendente lite period. But in the instant case the
Arbitral Tribunal has refused to award interest for the pendente lite period. Where the Arbitral
Tribunal has exercised its discretion and refused award of interest for the period pendente lite, even
if the principles in those two cases were applicable, the award of the Arbitrator could not be
interfered with. On this ground also the decisions in Engineers-De-Space- Age (supra) and Madnani
(supra) are inapplicable. Be that as it may."
27. This Court in Union of India v. Krafters Engineering & Leasing Pvt. Ltd. (2011) 7 SCC 279 has
held that by a provision in the agreement, the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to award interest can be
excluded. This Court considered the nature of the claim vis-à-vis the provision contained in the
relevant clause.
28. It is apparent from various decisions referred to above that in G.C. Roy (supra) Constitution
Bench of this Court has laid down where agreement expressly provides that no interest pendente lite
shall be payable on amount due. The arbitrator has no power to award interest. In N.C. Budharaj
(supra) a Constitution Bench has observed that in case there is nothing in the arbitration agreement
to exclude jurisdiction of arbitrator to entertaining claim for interest, the jurisdiction of arbitrator to
consider and award interest in respect to all periods is subject to section 29 of the Act. In Hindustan
Construction Co.
Ltd. (supra) this Court has followed decision in G.C. Roy (supra) and laid down that on the basis of
principles of section 34 arbitrator would have the power to award pendente lite interest also. In B.N.
Agarwalla (supra), this Court has again followed G.C. Roy (supra) and Hindustan Construction Co.
Ltd. (supra) with respect to power of arbitrator to award pendente lite interest and it was held that
arbitrator has power to award interest. In Harish Chandra (supra) this Court interpreted the clause
1.9 which provided that no claim for interest or damages will be entertained by the Government in
respect to any moneys or balances which may be lying with the Government. It was held that there
was no provision which could be culled out against the contractor not to claim interest by way of
damages before the arbitrator on the relevant items placed for adjudication. In Ferro Concrete
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 51Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
Construction (P) Ltd. (supra) this Court considered clause 4 containing a stipulation that no interest
was payable on amount withheld under the agreement. It was held that clause 4 dealt with rates,
material and workmanship did not bar award of interest by the arbitrator on claims of the
contractor made in the said case. In Sayeed Ahmed (supra) this Court has emphasized that award of
interest would depend upon nature of the clause in the agreement. In Bright Power Projects (India)
Pvt. Ltd. (supra) this Court has considered the expression "unless otherwise agreed by parties"
employed in section 31(7)(a) of the Act of 1996 and laid down that in case contract bars claim of
interest contractor could not have claimed interest. The provision of section 31(7)(a) of the Act of
1996 is binding upon the arbitrator. In Sree Kamatchi Amman Constructions (supra) similar view
has been taken."
(b) In Sri Chittaranjan Maity v. Union of India (9 supra), it is held as follows: (paragraphs 14 to 20).
"14. The total interest awarded by the Arbitral Tribunal is Rs.12,44,546/- which
includes interest for the pre- reference period and also pendente lite interest. Section
31(7)(a) of the 1996 Act provides for payment of interest, as under:
"31(7)(a) - Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, where and insofar as an arbitral award is for the
payment of money, the arbitral tribunal may include in the sum for which the award is made
interest, at such rate as it deems reasonable, on the whole or any part of the money, for the whole or
any part of the period between the date on which the cause of action arose and the date on which the
award is made." In this Section, a specific provision has been created, whereby if the agreement
prohibits award of interest for the pre-award period (i.e. pre- reference and pendente lite period),
the Arbitrator cannot award interest for the said period.
15. Admittedly, the GCC, governing the contract between the parties, contains a clause which bars
the payment of interest, which is as under:
"16(2) - No interest will be payable upon the earnest money or the security deposit or amounts
payable to the contractor under the contract, but government securities deposit in terms of
sub-clause (1) of this clause will be repayable (with) interest accrued thereon."
16. Relying on a decision of this Court in M/s. Ambica Construction vs. Union of India (2017) SCC
OnLine SC 678, (C.A.No.410 of 2008, disposed of on 26.04.2017) learned senior counsel for the
appellant submits that mere bar to award interest on the amounts payable under the contract would
not be sufficient to deny payment on pendente lite interest. Therefore, the Arbitrator was justified in
awarding the pendente lite interest. However, it is not clear from M/s. Ambica Construction (supra)
as to whether it was decided under The Arbitration Act, 1940 (for short 'the 1940 Act') or under the
1996 Act. It has relied on a judgment of Constitution Bench in Secretary, Irrigation Department,
Government of Orissa and Others. vs. G.C. Roy (1992) 1 SCC 508. This judgment was with reference
to the 1940 Act. In the 1940 Act, there was no provision which prohibited the Arbitrator from
awarding interest for the pre-reference, pendente lite or post award period, whereas the 1996 Act
contains a specific provision which says that if the agreement prohibits award of interest for the
pre-award period, the Arbitrator cannot award interest for the said period. Therefore, the decision

in M/s. Ambica Construction (supra) cannot be made applicable to the instant case.
17. Learned Additional Solicitor General appearing for the respondent submits that the position of
law for cases covered under the 1996 Act, i.e. if agreement prohibits award of interest then the grant
of pre-award interest is impermissible for the Arbitrator, has been reiterated by this Court in various
judgments.
18. In Sayeed Ahmed and Company vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others (2009) 12 SCC 26, this
Court noted that the 1940 Act did not contain any provision relating to the power of the Arbitrator
to award interest. However, now a specific provision has been created under Section 31(7)(a) of the
1996 Act. As per this Section, if the agreement bars payment of interest, the Arbitrator cannot award
interest from the date of cause of action till the date of award. The Court has observed that in regard
to the provision in the 1996 Act, the difference between pre- reference period and the pendente lite
interest has disappeared insofar as award of interest by the Arbitrator is concerned. Section 31(7)(a)
recognizes only two periods, i.e. pre-award and post-award period.
19. In Sree Kamatchi Amman Constructions vs. Divisional Railway Manager (Works), Palghat and
Others (2010) 8 SCC 767, this Court was dealing with an identical case wherein Clause 16 of the GCC
of Railways had required interpretation. This is the same Clause 16(2) of the GCC prohibiting grant
of interest which is also applicable in the facts of the present case. The Court held that where the
parties had agreed that the interest shall not be payable, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot award interest
between the date on which the cause of action arose to the date of the award.
20. In Union of India vs. Bright Power Projects (India) Private Limited (2015) 9 SCC 695, a
three-Judge Bench of this Court, after referring to the provisions of Section 31(7)(a) of the 1996 Act,
held that when the terms of the agreement had prohibited award of interest, the Arbitrator could not
award interest for the pendente lite period. It has been held thus:
"10. Thus, it had been specifically understood between the parties that no interest was to be paid on
the earnest money, security deposit and the amount payable to the contractor under the contract. So
far as payment of interest on government securities, which had been deposited by the respondent
contractor with the appellant is concerned, it was specifically stated that the said amount was to be
returned to the contractor along with interest accrued thereon, but so far as payment of interest on
the amount payable to the contractor under the contract was concerned, there was a specific term
that no interest was to be paid thereon.
11. When parties to the contract had agreed to the fact that interest would not be awarded on the
amount payable to the contractor under the contract, in our opinion, they were bound by their
understanding. Having once agreed that the contractor would not claim any interest on the amount
to be paid under the contract, he could not have claimed interest either before a civil court or before
an Arbitral Tribunal." Therefore, it is clear that the appellant is not entitled for any interest on the
amount awarded by the Arbitral Tribunal."

Accordingly, this point as regards claim No.14 is answered in favour of the appellant and against
respondent No.1.
39. Yet another contention of the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant is that the
Award stands vitiated as the Tribunal did not have a person with judicial knowledge. In order to
rebut the said contention, learned counsel for respondent No.1 places reliance on the following
judgments of the Hon'ble Apex Court :
(a) In Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. M/s. Jagannath Ashok Kumar and another (10 supra),
wherein it is held thus:
(paragraphs 4 and 5).
"4. In this case, there was no violation of any principles of natural justice. It is not a
case where the arbitrator has refused cogent and material factors to be taken into
consideration. The award cannot be said to be vitiated by non-reception of material
or non-consideration of the relevant aspects of the matter. Appraisement of evidence
by the arbitrator is ordinarily never a matter which the Court questions and
considers. The parties have selected their own forum and the deciding forum must be
conceded the power of appraisement of the evidence. In the instant case, there was
no evidence of violation of any principle of natural justice. The Arbitrator in our
opinion is the sole judge of the quality as well as quantity of evidence and it will not
be for this Court to take upon itself the task of being a judge of the evidence before
the arbitrator. It may be possible that on the same evidence the Court might have
arrived at a different conclusion than the one arrived at by the arbitrator but that by
it self is no ground in our view for setting aside the award of an arbitrator.
5. It is familiar learning but requires emphasis that section 1 of the Evidence Act,
1872 in its rigour is not intended to apply to proceedings before an arbitrator. P.B.
Mukharji, J. as the learned Chief Justice then was, expressed the above view in Haji
Ebrahim Kassam Cochinwall v. Nothern Indian oil Industries Ltd., A.I.R. 1951
Calcutta 230 and we are of the opinion that this represents the correct statement of
law on this aspect. Lord Goddard, C.J. in Mediterranean & Eastern Export Co. Ltd. v.
Fortress Fabrics Ltd., [1948] 2 All E.R. 186 observed at pages 188/189 of the report
as follows: "A man in the trade who is selected for his experience would be likely to
know and indeed to be expected to know the fluctuations of the market and would
have plenty of means of informing himself or refreshing his memory on any point on
which he might find it necessary so to do. In this case according to the affidavit of
sellers they did take the point before the Arbitrator that the Southern African market
has slumped. Whether the buyers contested that statement does not appear but an
experienced Arbitrator would know or have the means of knowing whether that was
so or not and to what extent and I see no reason why in principle he should be
required to have evidence on this point any more than on any other question relating
to a particular trade. It must be taken I think that in fixing the amount that he has, he
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/20087258/ 54Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited vs Radha Madhav Engg Enterprises on 22 September, 2021
has acted on his own knowledge and experience. The day has long gone by when the
Courts looked with jealousy on the jurisdiction of the Arbitrators. The modern
tendency is in my opinion more especially in commercial arbitrations, to endeavour
to uphold Awards of the skilled persons that the parties themselves have selected to
decide the questions at issue between them. If an Arbitrator has acted within the
terms of his submission and has not violated any rules of what is so often. called
natural justice the Courts should be slow indeed to set aside his award.""
(b) In P.R.Shah, Shares and Stock Brokers Private Limited v. B.H.H. Securities Private Limited &
others (11 supra), wherein it is held thus: (paras 22 and 23 ) "22. The appellant contends that the
arbitration had used personal knowledge to decide the matter. Attention was drawn to the following
observation in the award by the majority :
"Also, it is known fact which is known to the arbitrators that as per the market practice such kind of
transactions of one Broker takes place with another Broker either in their own name or in their
firm's name or in the name of different entity which is also owned by the member." Same way these
transactions are done by respondent no.2 (appellant herein) in the name of respondent no.1 (second
respondent herein)."
23. An arbitral tribunal cannot of course make use of their personal knowledge of the facts of the
dispute, which is not a part of the record, to decide the dispute. But an arbitral tribunal can certainly
use their expert or technical knowledge or the general knowledge about the particular trade, in
deciding a matter. In fact, that is why in many arbitrations, persons with technical knowledge, are
appointed as they will be well-versed with the practices and customs in the respective fields. All that
the arbitrators have referred is the market practice. That cannot be considered as using some
personal knowledge of facts of a transaction, to decide a dispute."
Therefore, the contention contra advanced by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
appellant, cannot stand for judicial scrutiny and is, accordingly, rejected.
40. For the aforesaid reasons, the COM.CA is partly allowed, setting aside the Award passed by the
Arbitral Tribunal vide Award dated 15.12.2006, as confirmed in the order and decree dated
16.08.2019 passed by the Court of the Special Judge for trial and disposal of the Commercial
Disputes, Visakhapatnam, in CAOP No.38 of 2017 (Old AAP No.306 of 2017) to the extent of Claim
No.14 and in respect of all other claims, this Appeal is dismissed. No costs.
Miscellaneous Petitions pending, if any, in this case shall stand closed.
