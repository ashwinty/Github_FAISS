JUDGMENT
B. N. Srikrishna, J.
1. This Appeal is directed against an order of the learned Single Judge (Rebello, J.) dated 3rd
August, 2000 made in Notice of Motion No. 908 of 2000 dismissing the Notice of Motion as against
the second Respondent and vacating the ad-Interim injunction orders as against the third and the
fourth Respondents. The learned Single Judge has narrated the facts in detail in the order and.
therefore, it is not necessary to reproduce the facts in extenso. However, some of the salient facts
required for decision of the Appeal may be recounted.
2. There is an agreement for bill discounting on certain terms and conditions between the
Appellant-original Plaintiff and the first Respondent (original first Defendant) under which the
Plaintiff had extended certain facilities to the first Respondent. These were guaranteed by the
second Respondent (original second Defendant). The Appellant, therefore, brought a Money Suit for
recovery of Rs. 13,42,00,023/- against the first and second Respondents. The Notice of Motion was
taken out for attachment before Judgment of two tangible assets of the first Respondent being two
office premises at Nariman Point, Mumbai. It was alleged in the affidavit-in-support of the Notice of
Motion that the first Respondent owed a large sum of moneys to the Appellant and the claim of the
Appellant was virtually admitted. It was pointed out that a Suit had been filed in the Calcutta High
Court against the first Respondent wherein an attachment before judgment was ordered against the
first Respondent. The first Respondent did not appear, but the attachment order was modified from
tim'e to time at the instance of the second Respondent. Finally, however, the Suit itself was
dismissed as being beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the Calcutta High Court. Hence, the present
Suit was brought in this Court against the first and second Respondents.
3. On the basis of the material presented before him, the learned Single Judge (Nijjar. J.) took the
view that the first Respondent had only two tangible assets begin the office premises at Nariman
Point, Mumbai. It was admitted that this had been sold off to the third and fourth Respondents
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/390874/ 1Sbi Home Finance Limited vs Credential Finance Limited & Ors. on 23 January, 2001
whose registered office addresses were also shown to be situated at the office address of the first
Respondent. It was, therefore, contended on behalf of the Appellant that the first Respondent was
closely connected with the third and the fourth Respondents and that the transfer was intended to
defraud the creditors, or at any rate, to delay or defeat the decree that might be made in the Suit.
Certain circumstances, like the filing of a winding up Petition against the first Respondent and
compromise entered into therein by the first Respondent, filing of an independent Suit by the
Appellant against the first Respondent in which a Receiver had been appointed, were also pointed
out to the learned Single Judge to indicate that there was acute financial stringency faced by the
Appellant. On a conspectus of all facts presented to him, Nijjar, J. was of the view that though
certain defences had been urged by the first and the second Respondents, their worth could have to
be tested and adjudicated at the trial, but that pending hearing of the Notice of Motion, the interest
of the Plaintiff had to be protected by an ad-Interim order. Consequently, the learned Single Judge
(Nijjar, J:) made an ad-interim order on 6th April, 2000 directing the first and the second
Respondents to furnish security towards the Appellant's suit claim In the amount of Rs.
13,42.00.23/-. either by the first Respondent alone or by equal contributions by the first and the
second Respondents, If so agreed upon between them. A period of six weeks was granted for
furnishing the security. Till the security was furnished, the first Respondent was tnjuncted from
alienating, encumbering, parting with possession of, disposing of or creating any third party rights
or inducting anyone into the aforesaid office premises at Nariman Point. Mumbal.
4. The Appellant Impleaded the present third and fourth Respondents as Respondents to the Notice
of Motion and applied for attachment before judgment of the two office premises which were
disclosed to have been sold even before the Suit was filed. The main premise on which the said relief
was sought against the third and the fourth Respondents was that the transfer of the two office
premises to the said Respondents was made with intent to defraud or delay the creditors of the
transferor (first Respondent) and. therefore, it was hit by Section 53 of the Transfer of Property Act,
1882 and voidable at the option of the Appellant creditor. The Notice of Motion was dismissed as
against the second Respondent and the relief of attachment of the office premises was declined by
the learned Single Judge by the impugned order. Apart from dismissing the Notice of Motion as
against the second Respondent, the learned Single Judge also vacated the ad-Interim injunction
orders against the third and the fourth Respondents. Being aggrieved thereby, the Appellant is
before this Court.
5. A perusal of the order of the learned Single Judge [Rebello, J.) shows that the only reason for
which the learned Single Judge refused the reliefs is found in paragraph 11 of the impugned order.
There was no dispute that concerned office premises had been sold to the third and the fourth
Respondents even before the filing of the Suit. Consequently, taking cue from Rule 10 of Order
XXXVIII of the Civil Procedure Code, the learned Single Judge was of the view that there could be
no order of attachment before judgment passed against the third and the fourth Respondents as
there was already an agreement for sale (as a matter of fact, even the conveyance had been
completed before the institution of the Suit). The Appellant relied on Section 53 of the Transfer of
Property Act, 1882, to contend that, though the sale of the properties had been completed prior to
the date of the suit, the sale was hit by Section 53 and was voidable at the option of the Appellant
creditor. The learned Judge, without even giving a prima facie finding as to the existence of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/390874/ 2Sbi Home Finance Limited vs Credential Finance Limited & Ors. on 23 January, 2001
circumstances contemplated by Section 53 of the Transfer of Property Act. 1882, dismissed the
argument by saying "..... Even if the argument of the Plaintiffs is accepted that at this stage such a
direction can be passed considering that the transactions are collusive in nature and the creditors
can avoid the same, Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 are also not parties to the Suit. They have merely been
joined as Respondents. No relief in the case at hand can be given, if the Respondents are not made
parties to the Suit. They can only be made parties, if they are necessary or proper parties. ..... There
can be no difficulty in accepting that at the stage of execution when property is sought to be attached
both under the old Code and under the new Code, parties whose personal property is sought to be
attached could raise objection. Similarly, Plaintiffs could have attached the property on the ground
thai the transaction was a nullity. In the Instant case Respondents are not Defendants to the Suit.
They are prohibited from raising any defence that they may have. As such insofar as Respondent
Nos. 1 and 2 are concerned in the absence of they being made Defendants in the Suit, no relief could
be granted by merely describing them as Respondents. .... Plaintiff, if they seek to void the
agreement must joint Respondents as Defendants to the suit whereupon they will be In a position to
raise all pleas and point out that no order can be passed without hearing the defence that may be
available to such party. Reliefs against Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 must, therefore, be rejected."
6. Mr. Tulzapurkar, learned Counsel for the Appellant, urged that the reasoning of the learned
Single Judge is erroneous in law. He contends that there is nothing In Section 53 of the Transfer of
Property Act, 1882 which requires a creditor Intending to take advantage of the Section to
necessarily bring a Suit for avoiding the transaction by which his debtor has fraudulently, or with
intent to defraud or delay, alienated valuable property. He contends that a transfer of property
voidable at the option of the creditor under Section 53 of the Transfer of Property Act. 1882 would
continue to be the property of the debtor and, therefore, be liable to attachment before judgment
under Order XXXVIII Rule 5 of the Civil Procedure Code, notwithstanding the provisions of Rule 8,
if the attaching creditor seeks to avoid the transaction between the creditor and the third party by
invoking Section 53 of the Transfer of Property Act. 1882. He urged that the learned Single Judge
was wrong in his assumption that the third and the fourth Respondents (transferees of the office
premises) were necessary or proper parties tc the money Suit brought by the Appellant against the
first and the second Respondents. He also urged that the view of the learned Single Judge, that no
order could be passed against the third and the fourth Respondents in the Notice of Motion without
their being Impleaded as party Defendants to the Suit, was wrong. He, therefore, contends that
because of this misdirection in law the learned Single Judge has not gone into the issue as to
whether there was a case made out under Section 53 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and. has
dismissed the Notice of Motion on an assumption that even if such case was made out the Motion
must fail as against third and fourth Respondents.
7. Normally, in a money Suit brought by a creditor against debtor, the only necessary party is the
debtor and the only issue to be answered is whether the debt is proved. The provisions of Order
XXXVIII Rules 5 and 13 of the Civil Procedure Code empower the Court to attach property
belonging to the Defendant even before judgment is pronounced against him. This can be done if the
Court is satisfied that with the intent to obstruct or delay the execution of any decree that may be
passed against him, the Defendant Is : (a) about to dispose of the whole or any part of his property;
or (b) about to remove the whole or any part of his property beyond the local limits of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/390874/ 3Sbi Home Finance Limited vs Credential Finance Limited & Ors. on 23 January, 2001
jurisdiction of the Court. When such conditions exist, the Court is empowered to direct the
Defendant to produce security within the time fixed by it in such sum as may be specified by it or to
show cause why the Defendant should not furnish such security. If the Defendant fails to show
cause, or fails to furnish security, then the Court is empowered under Rule 5(3) of Order XXXVIII of
the Civil Procedure Code to make an order attaching the property before judgment. Rule 7 provides
that unless expressly so provided, the attachment before judgment is to be made in the same
manner as attachment of property in execution of a decree. Even if the property is attached, it is
open to any one who claims the property to be his, to put forth such a claim before the Court and
Rule 8 of Order XXXVIII provides that such a claim shall be adjudicated upon in the manner
provided for adjudication of the claim to property attached in execution of a decree for the payment
of money. Rule 10 provides that attachment before judgment shall not affect the rights existing prior
to the attachment of persons who are not parties to the suit, nor bar any person holding a decree
against the Defendant from applying for the sale of the property under attachment in execution of
such decree.
8. Order XXI Rule 58 of the Civil Procedure Code deals with the procedure for adjudication of
claims or objections to attachment of property. Whenever property is attached in execution of a
decree, any person who has any claim in the property or objects to such attachment, can lodge his
claim or objection before the executing Court and all questions including questions relating to right,
title and interest of the property attached have to be adjudicated by such Court dealing with the
claim for objection and not by a separate Suit. Such an adjudication order is given the same status as
a decree under the Civil Procedure Code, subject to the same conditions as to Appeal or otherwise in
a Suit for decree. Such a claim or objection may be summarily rejected by the Court if made after the
property has been sold in execution or after an unreasonable delay. If the Court declines to
adjudicate the claim/objection to the attached property under these circumstances, the person
putting forth the claim or objection has a right to bring a substantive suit for determination of the
right which he claims to the property in dispute.
9. Prior to the amendment of the Civil Procedure Code by Act 1976 (with effect from 1st February,
1977), the procedure for adjudication of such claim or objection was slightly different. Such a claim
or objection had to be decided in a summary manner by the executing Court. Rule 63 of Order XXI,
which was omitted by the Amendment Act of 1976, specifically kept open the right of the party
aggrieved by the summary determination of the claim/objection to bring a substantive Suit for
determining his right in the property. This position is now radically changed as a result of the
Amending Act of 1976. As already pointed out, all claims or objections to the property under
attachment in execution have to be adjudicated by the executing Court even if they involve questions
of title to or interest in the property. Such adjudication order has the same status as a decree and
subject to the same rule as to appeal. The procedure as to the investigation of claims and objections
to attached property is the same whether the attachment is in execution of a decree under Rule 58 or
an attachment before judgment, by virtue of Rule 57 of Order XXI of the Civil Procedure Code.
10. Undoubtedly, the properties in question were agreed to be and actually sold to the third and the
fourth Respondents much before the date on which the Suit was brought by the Appellant.
Normally, therefore, by reason of Rule 10 of Order XXXVIII, an attachment before Judgment could
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/390874/ 4Sbi Home Finance Limited vs Credential Finance Limited & Ors. on 23 January, 2001
not be levied against the properties which had already been sold to the third and the fourth
Respondents. Do the provisions of Section 53 of the Transfer of Property Act. 1882 make any
change?, is the issue raised in the present Appeal.
11. Section 53 of the Transfer of Property Act. 1882 enables a creditor to avoid the transfer of
immovable property which has been made with intent to defraud, defeat or delay and such a transfer
would be voidable at the option of any creditor so defrauded, defeated or delayed. In the instant
case. If the Appellant can show that the transfer of the office premises at Nariman Point. Mumbai
was made by the first Respondent to the third and the fourth Respondents under circumstances
which would fall within the ambit of Section 53 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, the Appellant
would be entitled to avoid the transfer. In such a situation, the said properties shall be treated as
properties of the first Respondent itself, and the fact that a fraudulent attempt was made to put
them beyond the reach of the Appellant creditor, would be good reason to make an order of
attachment before judgment under Order 38 Rule 5 of the Civil Procedure Code. We would have,
therefore, thought that the issue as to whether the circumstances contemplated by Section 53 of the
Transfer of Property Act, 1882 existed would have been first determined. Unfortunately, the learned
Single Judge proceeded only on an assumption. If it be assumed that the circumstances
contemplated by Section 53 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 do exist, then is the Appellant
entitled to raise the said issue and have it adjudicated in the present Notice of Motion or is the
Appellant obliged to bring a substantive suit for having this issue adjudicated, is the next question
for determination.
12. In Abdul Kadir v. Ali Mia and Ors.,, the Calcutta High Court, in a case arising prior to the 1976
Amendment, had to consider the issue. The Defendant had obtained a decree in a money Suit and
attached certain property In execution. A claim was made by the Plaintiff (a third party) with regard
to his interest in the property which was summarily rejected by the Executing Court. The Plaintiff
then brought a substantive suit for declaration of his right, title and interest in the property. The
Defendant contended that the transfer to the Plaintiff was hit by Section 53 of the Transfer of
Property Act, 1882. The Court had to consider whether the said issue could be brought before the
Court by way of defence or whether it had to be raised by an Independent Suit by the Defendant.
The Court pointed out that Section 53 gives the aggrieved creditor an option to avoid the
transaction. The Intention to exercise this option may be said to have been evidenced when for the
first time in execution the first Defendant insisted on the determination of the defence raised by him
by saying that the title upon which the Plaintiff relied was obtained by fraud and, therefore,
ineffectual as against him.
13. In Velchand Sawaji Marwadi v. Sitaram Tukaram,. our High Court reiterated this proposition.
14. The Patna High Court in Mt. Bibi Kubra Begum and Anr. v. Jalnandan Prasad and Ors., made it
further clear by its observations in paragraph 24 of the judgment by saying "..... even then, the
transfer can still be avoided at the option of the creditor as provided by para 1 of Section 53 of the T.
P. Act, provided the transfer was made with intent to defeat or delay the creditors. It is true that this
is not a suit by a creditor to avoid the transfer; but a creditor may manifest his intention to avoid the
transaction otherwise than by filing a suit, as 'for example, by attaching the property transferred;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/390874/ 5Sbi Home Finance Limited vs Credential Finance Limited & Ors. on 23 January, 2001
such an action had been taken by the defendant-first-party, the creditor." The observation of the
House of Lords in Oakes v. Turquand and Harding,. to the effect that "voidable transactions may be
avoided by any open or unequivocal declaration of an intention to avoid them" was emphasised. The
House of Lords had also pointed out that "..... it was open to an attaching decree-holder to plead in
defence to a suit by the alienee whose claim has been rejected that the transfer to him was
fraudulent under Section 53 of the T. P. Act......"
15. Any lingering doubts are put to rest by the judgment of the Supreme Court in C. Abdul Shukoor
Saheb v. Arji Papa Rao (deceased) after him his heirs and legal representatives and Ors.,. This
judgment, in terms, cites with approval and upholds all propositions laid down in the Full Bench
judgment of the Madras High Court in Ramaswami Chettiar v. Mallappa Reddiar, which had held
the field for more than forty years. This was a case arising much before the Amending Act of 1976
and, as such, the claims were to be investigated in summary proceedings under Order XXI Rules 58
to 61. The Supreme Court pointed out that in such summary proceedings, having regard to the terms
of Rule 61, the Court was concerned only with the question as to whether the transferee is in
possession of the property in his own right and not on behalf of the judgment-debtor. When a
transfer is real, though it is liable to be impeached as a fraud on creditors, and the transferee has
entered into possession, he would succeed in the summary proceedings, with the result that It Is the
defeated attaching creditor who would have to figure as a Plaintiff. In every case, therefore, when a
transfer is real but is liable to be set aside under Section 53(1) of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882,
In such summary proceedings the transferee was bound to succeed and the attaching decree-holder
would have to figure as a Plaintiff in the substantive suit. From this, it was argued that in no case
could an attaching creditor defend a Suit for attachment resisting it on the plea of fraud under
Section 53(1) of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. The Supreme Court rejected the argument by
holding that it did not proceed on any construction of the terms of Section 53(1), nor on any legal
theory as to the mode or procedure, by which the intention to avoid the transaction which the
attaching creditor claims is voidable at his instance may be expressed or enforced. The Supreme
Court reiterated the reasoning of the Full Bench of the Madras High Court to hold that a plea based
on the transfer being voidable under Section 53(1) could not be raised in defence to a Suit to set
aside a summary order would mean that the creditor decree-holder would be in a much worse
position for his success in the summary claim proceedings than if he had lost in those proceedings.
It is also pointed out that though Section 53(1) of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 renders the
transfer voidable at the instance of the creditors, if the transfer was effected under circumstances
indicated in the Section, the Statute does not prescribe any particular method of avoidance. The
Supreme Court agreed with the observations of the Full Bench of the Madras High Court. "If the
creditor knowing of the transfer applies for attachment, the application is sufficient evidence of his
intention to avoid it; if he only hears of the transfer when a claim petition is preferred under Order
XXI Rule 58, and still maintains his right to attach, that again is a sufficient exercise of his option to
avoid and entitles him to succeed in the subsequent Suit under Rule 63." The Supreme Court also
pointed out that whether the Suit was instituted by an attaching decree-holder or the transferee
claimant, it must be equally decided in favour of the attaching decree-holder if the transfer is shown
to have been fraudulent, because in consequence of the fraudulent character of the transfer and its
avoidance by the judgment-creditor, the result is that the transferee has not the right which he
claims, namely, to hold the property free from attachment in execution by the Judgment-creditor.

16. We have deliberately not dealt in extenso with the observations of the Full Bench of the Madras
High Court as the said judgment has been considered and approved by the Supreme Court and it is
held that in order to avoid the transaction by putting forth Section 53 of the Transfer of Property
Act, 1882, the creditor need not bring forth a substantive Suit. Even in the erstwhile days, when the
proceedings for determination of the claims/objections to property attached in execution of a decree
were summary, the Supreme Court was of the view that the very attachment made at the instance of
the creditor would be indicative of his intent to exercise the option of avoiding the transfer which
falls within the ambit of Section 53 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882.
17. In our view, the situation after 1977 has radically changed. Gone is the summary procedure for
determination of claims or objections to properties under attachment. Every such claim or objection
has now to be adjudicated and no substantive Suit can be brought for such adjudication. The order
made on such adjudication would have the force of a decree subject to Appeal. There is nothing in
the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act. 1882 which requires the issue to be raised by a
substantive Suit as Section 53 does not prescribe the mode by which the issue is to be determined.
Under the present procedure of determination of such claims to property attached in execution or
before attachment, when a person makes a claim or objection to the property under attachment, the
Court has to finally adjudicate such claim or objection. If upon such claim or objection being
preferred, the creditor raises the issue that such claim or objection has no substance because the
transfer to the claimant/objector is hit by Section 53, then the said issue also has to be adjudicated
as it would involve adjudication of the title or right to or interest in the property. The Court deciding
the claim would have to adjudicate all these issues and render a final decision which would have the
force of a decree subject to Appeal. We are. therefore, of the view that the learned Single Judge was
not right in declining to decide the issue on the ground that the third and the fourth Respondents
(alienees) were not parties to the Suit. Nor was he right in taking the view that the issue had to be
determined by a substantive Suit brought at the Instance of the Appellant. In our judgment, there
was no need for the Appellant to bring a substantive Suit for determination of the issue raised by it,
namely, that the transfer was void. The Appellant's unequivocal declaration, even in the Notice of
Motion, and seeking of an attachment before judgment of the alienated property amounted to
avoiding the alienation of the property. If the order for attachment before judgment had been made,
and the third and the fourth Respondents had come forth with a claim to the property, the Court
would then have to necessarily determine their title to or interest in the attached property. At that
time, the contention of the Appellant that the transfer was hit by Section 53 would also have to be
adjudicated. If this can be done after attachment and notice to the third and the fourth
Respondents, we see no reason why this could not be done before attachment by issuing notices to
and hearing the third and the fourth Respondents, even if they were not parties to the Suit itself. We
are not in agreement with the view of the learned Single Judge that the third and the fourth
Respondents could or ought to have been made parties to the money Suit brought by the Appellant
against the first and second Respondents. The money Suit had nothing to do with the property.
Property would come in only at the stage of execution of a decree or attachment before judgment as
in the instant case.
18. Two judgments of the Supreme Court were cited in support by the Respondents. In Vannarakkal
Kallalathil Sreedharan v. Chandramaath Balakrishnan and Anr.,1. there was an agreement of sale
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/390874/ 7Sbi Home Finance Limited vs Credential Finance Limited & Ors. on 23 January, 2001
which had been entered into before attachment and a conveyance followed the attachment order.
The Supreme Court took the view that the agreement for sale had created an obligation on the
ownership of the property and since the attaching creditor is entitled to attach only the right, title
and interest of the Judgment-debtor, the attachment cannot be free from obligations incurred under
the contract for sale. There is nothing in this judgment which helps the Respondents. The Supreme
Court was not concerned with the issues which have been presented to us for determination.
19. In Hamda Ammal v. Avadiappa Pathar and Ors., also the Supreme Court emphasised that Order
XXXVIII Rule 5 would not apply where a sale-deed had already been executed by the Defendant in
favour of a third person. It was pointed out that a transaction of sale having already taken place even
prior to the institution of a Suit, it could not be said to be made with intention to obstruct or delay
the execution of any decree. Interestingly, the Supreme Court further observed. "It would be a
different case altogether if a creditor wants to assail such transfer by sale under Section 53 of the
Transfer of Property Act. 1882." The Supreme Court no doubt emphasised Order XXXVIII Rule 10
to show that an attachment before Judgment shall not affect the rights existing prior to the
attachment of persons not parties to the Suit. We are unable to accept the contention of the
Respondents that this case indicates that the Issue of alienation could not be raised in the
proceedings for adjudication of the claim to the property or that it could be raised only in a
substantive Suit. The Supreme Court has merely Indicated that Section 53 is a different cup of tea,
without indicating the manner in which Section 53 had to be pressed forward.
20. For the aforementioned reasons, we are of the view that it was open to the Appellant to raise the
issue as to whether the transfer of the office premises to the third and the fourth Respondents was
hit by Section 53 in the Notice of Motion. The issue having been raised, it had to be adjudicated by
the Trial Court as If it was brought in a substantive Suit. Since such opportunity was not given to the
Appellant, we are of the view that the order of the learned Single Judge needs to be interfered with.
21. In the result, we set aside the impugned order of the learned Single Judge and restore the Notice
of Motion. Mr. Tulzapurkar states thai, as far as the second Respondent is concerned, he does not
press for any order against the second Respondent.
22. The Notice of Motion shall be heard on its merits in accordance with law and in the light of this
judgment.
23. It is contended by the Respondents that the ad-interim order made by Nijjar. J., came to an end
as a result of dismissal of the Notice of Motion on 3rd August, 2000 and that, though the Appeal was
presented on 19th August, 2000, there was no ad-interim order sought in the Appeal. In our view, it
makes no difference. It was considered necessary by the learned Single Judge that the ad-interim
order should be made: we too consider it necessary. Hence, pending hearing and disposal of the
Notice of Motion, there shall be an ad-interim order in terms of prayer clause (c) (ii) as made by
Nijjar, J., on 6th April, 2000.
24. Appeal accordingly allowed. Costs of the Appeal to be the costs of the Suit.
