HONOURABLE
MR.JUSTICE R.D.KOTHARI
Date : 05/12/2013
ORAL JUDGMENT
1. This is plaintiff s appeal.
2. In this appeal, following main points arise for consideration:-
(a) What makes the deed of power of attorney an irrevocable deed ?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116929415/ 7Mahesh Govindji Trivedi vs Legal Heirs Of Bhagvanji on 5 December, 2013
(b) Whether the suit filed by legatee, in absence of probate or letters of administration, as the case
may be,is maintainable or not ?
Scope of section 213 of the Indian Succession Act.
is the case on hand falls under section 204 of the Indian Contract Act ?
(e) Is it possible to accept as general proposition that stranger to contract cannot sue ? Secondly, in
the facts of the present case, is it possible to say that since the original owner has not challenged the
transaction, person who is deriving interest from the original owner, cannot challenge the same.
2.1 The appeal also raises a question, when the Court can compare the signature under section 73 of
the Evidence Act ?
3. The facts of the case are fairly simple. The relevant facts are thus:-
3.1 One Ramalaxmiben owned one property at village Mandvi, District : Kutch. It is an agricultural
land bearing survey No.154. It is a suit land admeasuring 13 acres 24 gunthas. The said suit property
came to be sold by defendant No.1 to defendant No.2 by executing a registered sale deed dated
18.4.2007. That had led the plaintiff to institute Special Civil Suit No.86/2007, challenging the
legality of said sale deed and dismissal of said suit has given rise to the present appeal.
3.2 The defendant No.1 had executed sale deed in favour of defendant No2 on the strength of power
of attorney dated 28.8.1997 said to have been executed by said Ramalaxmiben in favour of
defendant No.1. Ramalaxmiben died on 3.1.2004. The agreement to sell of the suit property said to
have been executed on 29.7.1997. Pending Special Civil Suit No.86/2007, defendant No.2
transferred the suit property in favour of defendant Nos.3 to 6. Hence, defendant Nos.3 to 6 came to
be joined as party-defendants. The said second sale deed is dated 29.3.2008. It is the case of the
plaintiff that deceased Ramalaxmiben has executed her last Will in favour of the plaintiff on
31.8.2001. The plaintiff came to know in August 2007 that the suit transaction has taken place and
hence the plaintiff filed the above referred Special Civil Suit. It is the case of the defendant that the
deceased had executed a Will on 25.7.1996 in favour of defendant No.1 and other brothers including
the plaintiff. The plaintiff had filed an application for obtaining probate before the Court at Bombay
on 22.9.2004. The said application is for obtaining Probate of Will said to have been executed by the
deceased on 31.8.2001 in favour of plaintiff. The said application for probate was pending at the
time of hearing of this appeal.
3.3 Special Civil Suit No. 86/2007 was mainly contested by defendant No.2-purchaser. Defendant
No.2 filed Written Statement at Exh.35. Defendant Nos.3 to 6 filed their Written Statement Exh.47
supporting the say of the defendant No.2. Defendant denies all the assertions made by the plaintiff.
Defendant Nos.3 to 6 claim that they are bona fide purchasers of the property.
3.4 The evidence of the plaintiff is recorded at Exh.70. The plaintiff has examined two other
witnesses, namely, Narendrabhai Joshi (at Exh.118) and Jitendra Ratilal (at exh.129). Former is the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116929415/ 8Mahesh Govindji Trivedi vs Legal Heirs Of Bhagvanji on 5 December, 2013
witness to the Will executed in favour of the plaintiff, whereas the latter is employee of newspaper.
The evidence of defendant No.2 is recorded at Exh.164 and the evidence of defendant No.5 is
recorded at Exh.168. The parties have filed relevant documentary evidence in support of their
respective case.
4. Upon hearing the learned advocates for the parties and considering the material on record, the
learned trial Court was pleased to dismiss Special Civil Suit No.86/2007 by judgment and order
dated 86/2007. The findings of the learned trial Court broadly stated are as under:-
(a) that, the defendant No.1 has not led any evidence. Pending the suit, defendant No.1 died and
heirs and legal representatives of defendant No.1 are joined as party.
that, the plaintiff has not proved that he owns the suit property on the basis of the Will. The issue of
validity of the Will is pending before the Bombay High Court. Since the original Will is not before
the trial Court and it is before the Bombay High Court, it is not for this Court, i.e. learned trial Court,
to decide the validity of the said Will.
that, the plaintiff otherwise also cannot be declared as owner of the property because the plaintiff
happens to be the accused in the murder case. It is possible to relate the suit property with the
murder case. Section 25 of the Hindu Succession Act disqualifies the murderer. The intention of
Ramalaxmiben cannot be to override Section 25.
The say of the plaintiff that the deceased cancelled the power of attorney by issuing a public notice
in the newspaper in 1996 is not possible to believe because deed of power of attorney is of 1997.
Plaintiff cannot be declared as owner of the suit property also because transaction has taken place
during the life time of Ramalaxmiben. That, after payment of earnest money, remaining amount of
consideration is paid within short-time.
Plaintiff has failed to prove his case of cancelling the sale deed and, therefore, the deed executed in
favour of defendant No.2 should be considered to be legal. Therefore, defendant NO.2 would be the
bona fide purchase of the property for value.
Irrevocable power of attorney deed is executed in 1997. As per the say of defendant No.2, earnest
money is received by defendant No.1 in presence of deceased Ramalaxmiben. This assertion is not
challenged by the plaintiff in cross-examination of defendant No.2. This evidence has gone
unchallenged.
Reverse Presumption is possible to draw, whereby plaintiff s failure to prove by documentary
evidence, defendant s lack of interest would make way to presume that agreement to sale and
sale-deed executed in favour of defendant No.2, are for consideration and they are valid.
That, Ramalaxmiben wanted to sell the suit land. Defendant No.1 had informed defendant No.2
about this and as defendant No.2 had agreed, transaction had taken place in presence of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116929415/ 9Mahesh Govindji Trivedi vs Legal Heirs Of Bhagvanji on 5 December, 2013
Ramalaxmiben and it was finalized as per her wish. In pursuance of that, defendant No.1 had
executed the agreement to sell.
As deed of power of attorney is executed before the competent authority and consideration is paid as
per the agreement to sell and thereafter possession of suit property was handed over. Therefore,
deed of power of attorney can be considered to be coupled with interest and irrevocable .
Defendant Nos.3 to 6 are bona fide purchasers of the suit property, as defendant No.2 clearly says in
his evidence that he has not said to defendant Nos.3 to 6 about pendency of litigation at the time of
selling of the suit property. On the other hand, defendant Nos.3 to 6 had verified the entries in the
revenue record. In the revenuer record, property was in the name of defendant No.2. The plaintiff
has unsuccessfully challenged the revenue entries. That, defendant Nos.3 to 6 are bona fide
purchasers also because they have purchased the suit property by paying consideration.
No contempt by defendant No.2, as it is clear say of defendant No.2 in his evidence that he was not
informed by his advocate about tendering of oral undertaking as to not to enter into any transaction
qua suit property.
Deed of power of attorney is irrevocable, as agreement to sell has taken place in presence of and
during the life time of deceased Ramalaxmiben and thereby interest has passed on. Hence, power of
attorney deed has become irrevocable. That, it is irrevocable is also stated in the deed itself.
Deed of power of attorney is irrevocable and document executed on the basis of such deed is valid.
It clearly appears that defendant No.2 is bona fide purchase and, therefore, it is proved that he is a
full legal owner of the suit property. Legal owner, who is in possession of property, is free to use and
transfer his property. Deed in favour of defendant Nos.3 to 6 executed thereafter is therefore, legal.
(p) The plaintiff s suit is not maintainable, as the plaintiff has not prayed for possession of the suit
property.
(q) The Court says that it has studied the case laws cited by the plaintiff and most of the case laws
are on section 202 of the Contract Act. Since the plaintiff has not obtained Probate or Letters of
Administration, the Court says that the case laws do not support the plaintiff. Further, the facts of
the cases cited by the plaintiff were different, therefore, they do not help the plaintiff. On the other
hand, the case-laws cited by the defendant,-says the Court,- are mainly on section 213 of the Indian
Succession Act and on irrevocable power of attorney. In my discussion,- it says,- in the judgment I
have taken support of this case-laws, as they support the case of the defendant.
5. It may be stated that before this Court, the appellant sought permission to amend the plaint by
filing Civil Application No. 8021/2013 in First Appeal No. 2453/2012. By way of filing the said civil
application, the appellant-plaintiff had sought permission to add a prayer of possession. The said
civil application was opposed by the respondent-defendant and after hearing the learned advocates
for the parties, the said civil application was allowed by this Court and the appellant-plaintiff was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116929415/ 10Mahesh Govindji Trivedi vs Legal Heirs Of Bhagvanji on 5 December, 2013
permitted to amend the plaint on a condition of payment of costs to the respondent-defendant.
Accordingly, the appellant-plaintiff has amended the plaint.
6. Heard learned Senior Advocate Shri S.N.Shelat for the appellant and learned advocate Shri
M.B.Gandhi for the respondents-defendants.
7. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Shelat, after briefly referring the facts of the case, has drawn
attention of the Court to the relevant provisions of Sections 201 to 204 of the Indian Contract Act. It
was submitted that merely by labelling the deed as irrevocable power of attorney , it does not
become so and in the facts and circumstances of the present case, the deed of power of attorney was
revocable. As the deed of power of attorney was not irrevocable, the sale deed executed by the
defendant on the strength of such power of attorney stands vitiated and, therefore, it is null and
void. It was submitted that the learned trial Court has seriously erred in dismissing the plaintiff s
suit. The learned Senior Advocate Shri Shelat has drawn attention of the Court to the relevant case
laws to which reference may be made hereinafter.
8. On the other hand, learned advocate Shri Gandhi has supported the judgment under appeal. Shri
Gandhi, in view of the submissions advanced by him at the time of hearing, has submitted that the
plaintiff has no right to file suit. In addition to it and in the alternative, it was submitted that the suit
was not maintainable. The principal submissions of learned advocate Shri Gandhi are as under:-
(a) that, the plaintiff has no right to file the suit because the plaintiff claims right under the Will and
that such a right can be effective and meaningful only when the plaintiff obtains probate or letter of
administration, as the case may be. That, until the probate is granted by the competent Court, such a
right would be in the area of contingent right or a right in the nature of inchoate right and that being
so, no person can base his or her claim on the basis of such a nature of right.
(b) that, in view of section 213 of the Indian Succession Act read with Section 9 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, plaintiff s suit is barred.
(c) that, the plaintiff is not party to the contract. The agreements that are under challenge are
executed by the defendants inter se. A person, who is not a party to the contract and who is a
stranger to the contract, cannot bring the action challenging the contract.
(d) that, the original owner of the property has not challenged the transaction during her life time.
So, the person deriving right of interest from the original owner cannot challenge the transaction.
(e) that, relying on Section 204 of the Contract Act, it was urged that as the agent has partly
exercised authority, now it cannot be revoked.
(f) that, the first Will executed is a registered Will and the second Will on which the plaintiff places
reliance is not a registered Will. Therefore, the former should be preferred to the latter. Further, in
view of the ratio laid down in Minaxiben Shashikantbhai Patel v. Dist. Collector, 2007(1) GLR 277,
in respect of former Will, no probate is required to be obtained. That, being so, a person s right
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116929415/ 11Mahesh Govindji Trivedi vs Legal Heirs Of Bhagvanji on 5 December, 2013
under the first Will will be crystallized and ripened on execution of Will itself. Further, still, under
the former Will, all the four brothers, including the plaintiff herein, have acquired right and interest
over the suit property. In absence of challenge by the other brothers to the suit transaction read with
receiving of full consideration and handing over of possession of the property, plaintiff s challenge to
the suit transaction ought not to be accepted.
(g) Relying on Section 73 of the Indian Evidence Act, a submission was made to compare the
signatures appearing on page 17 versus page 38 of the paper-book and also page 19 versus page 38
of the paper-book. In this regard, the learned counsel has urged to read page 36 of the paper-book
with Exh.117. It was submitted that dissimilarity in the signatures would be apparent.
(h) that, at the time of execution of the alleged second Will, Ramalaxmiben was undergoing
treatment and she was hospitalized at Bombay. Hence, execution of second Will is unreliable. It was
also submitted that the fact that prayer for possession claimed only at the appellate stage ought to be
considered while considering the plaintiff s claim on merits. The submission in this regard is two
fold; firstly, as otherwise the plaintiff has no right or interest in the property, prayer for possession
cannot improve, in any way, the case of the plaintiff, and secondly, relief of possession is in the
nature of discretionary relief and in the circumstances of the present case, when the right and
interest is transferred in favour of a third party, prayer for decree of possession ought not to be
passed on at this belated stage.
9. In order to appreciate the challenge to the suit transaction and the above referred to submissions
made by the learned advocate for the respondent, brief reference to the other relevant facts as
emerges from the record may be made:-
It is the say of the plaintiff-appellant that notwithstanding the alleged former Will in favour of
defendant No.1 and other brothers, defendant No.1 has just within 13 days of the death of
Ramalaxmiben filed civil suit before the Civil Court at Mandvi claiming share in the property. That
suit was transferred to the Court which has tried the present suit, i.e. Special Civil Suit No. 86/2007.
The said suit is said to be pending.
(2) It is not in dispute that defendant No.2- purchaser of the property is none-else, but the father of
junior advocate Mr. Fufal, who is said to be working with advocate Mr. A.J.Thakker, who is advocate
for defendant No.2.
(3) Defendant No.5 in his evidence admits that he along with defendant No.2 has purchased many
properties. He further says that Mr. A.J.Thakker is their advocate in many cases. He denies the
suggestion put to him that they used to purchase disputed properties. He also denies the suggestion
that more than couple of litigations of their disputed properties are pending.
(4) One Ravishanker is husband of deceased Ramalaxmiben. Ravishanker had two wives, namely,
(i) Labhkuvarben and (ii) Ramalaxmiben. Labhkuvarben was murdered for which the present
appellant-plaintiff along with others were prosecuted. In fact, Sessions Court had convicted the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116929415/ 12Mahesh Govindji Trivedi vs Legal Heirs Of Bhagvanji on 5 December, 2013
present appellant-plaintiff. This appears to have weighed to some extent with the trial Court, as the
trial Court has observed that under the Hindu Succession Act, a person, who has committed murder,
cannot inherit or acquire property. The appellant has produced a copy of the judgment of the
appellate Court wherein the appellant-plaintiff is acquitted by the appellate Court. By filing Civil
Application No. 7799/2013 the appellant has sought permission to place on record judgment of the
appellate Court. This civil application was heard along with the main appeal. The learned advocate
for the respondents has seriously opposed this application. Bearing in mind that the applicant seeks
permission to produce judgment delivered by the appellate Court, the objection raised by the
learned advocate for the respondents cannot be accepted. Hence, the civil application is allowed.
The judgment of the appellate Court is taken on record.
10. I may consider the case of parties on merits.
10.1 The nature of power of attorney is determinative of the fate of the case. Of course, fate of case
also depends upon the different pleas of maintainability of suit raised by the respondent. First about
deed of power of attorney. It is at Exh.97. It is dated 28.7.1997. It is said to have been executed by
deceased Ramalaxmiben in favour of Bhagwanji Govindji Trivedi (i.e. defendant No.1). It would
appear from Exh.97 that deceased Ramalaxmiben was also a trustee of one Trust named
Ravishanker Gangubai Charitable Trust . The said Trust owns property at Bombay. In Exh.97,
Ramalaxmiben refers the property of the said Trust and also the property owned by her, which
situate at Mandvi. In Exh.97, though there is no reference to survey No.154, i.e. suit property, it is
not in dispute between the parties that deed of power of attorney pertains to the suit property also.
In the said deed, the executant, i.e. Ramalaxmiben, has conferred all rights upon the power of
attorney holder to deal with the property including power to purchase and dispose of the property. It
is stated that it is irrevocable power of attorney.
11. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Shelat for the appellant has drawn attention of the Court to
Section 201 of the Indian Contract Act, which reads thus:-
201. Termination of agency;- An agency is terminated by the principal revoking his authority, or by
the agent renouncing the business of the agency; or by the business of the agency being completed;
or by either the principal or agent dying or becoming of unsound mind; or by the principal being
adjudicated an insolvent under the provisions of any Act for the time being in force for the relief of
insolvent debtors.
12. A bare reading of Section 201 would show that the agreement stands terminated on the death of
either the principal or the agent. In the present case, Ramalaxmiben has died on 3.1.2004 and the
deed of power of attorney was executed on 28.8.1997 and on the strength of deed of power of
attorney, agreement to sell was executed on 29.11.1997. Thereafter, after the death of
Ramalaxmiben, sale deed was executed by the defendant No.1 in favour of defendant No.2 on
18.4.2007. On the basis of this admitted fact, it cannot be denied that deed of power of attorney
stands revoked on the death of Ramalaxmiben, unless it becomes irrevocable under section 202 or it
is a case under section 204 of the Contract Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116929415/ 13Mahesh Govindji Trivedi vs Legal Heirs Of Bhagvanji on 5 December, 2013
13. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Shelat has drawn attention of the Court to the case of Prahlad and
others v. Laddevi and Ors., AIR 2007 Rajasthan
166. The learned Single Judge in that case has held thus:-
A power of attorney granted by the donor to the donee is operative and effective only during the
lifetime of the donor. The donor and donee stand in relationship of `master and agent . Since the
actions done by donee are deemed to be the actions done on the part of the donor, naturally such a
power of attorney cannot be operative or be effective after the demise of the donor. Therefore, the
power of attorney granted by Mr. Jain on 28.5.1997 came to an end on 20.10.1997 upon his demise .
The case of Prahald and others (supra) supports the case of the appellant.
14. But, it is the case of the defendant that deed of power of attorney is irrevocable and in the
alternative, as the authority under the deed of power of attorney is partly exercised, therefore, in
view of section 204, deed cannot be revoked.
14.1 Section 202 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 reads thus:
202. Termination of agency, where agent has an interest in subject matter:- Where the agent has
himself an interest in the property which forms the subject matter of the agency, the agency cannot,
in the absence of an express contract, be terminated to the prejudice of such interest .
Section 202 gives illustrations. They read thus:
(a) A gives authority to B to sell A s land, and to pay himself, out of the proceeds, the debts due to
him from A. A cannot revoke this authority, nor can it be terminated by his insanity or death.
(b) A consigns 1000 bales of cotton to B, who has made advances to him on such cotton, and desires
B to sell the cotton, and to repay himself out of the price the amount of his own advances. A cannot
revoke this authority, nor is it terminated by his insanity or death.
15. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Shelat has drawn attention of the Court to the case of
H.H.Maharani Shantidevi P.Gaikwad v. Savjibhai Haribhai Patel & Ors, AIR 2001 SC 1462.
The main question arose for consideration in that case was interpretation of some provisions of ULC
Act, 1976, particularly Section 21 of the said Act. Section 21 deals with the cases in which excess land
would not be treated as excess land. An agreement was entered into between the plaintiff Mr. Patel
and defendant No.1 Shri Gaikwad. Under the said agreement, the plaintiff had evolved a scheme for
construction of dwelling units for the weaker section of the society as envisaged under the Act. The
said units were to be constructed on defendant No.1 s land. The total land covered under the
agreement was 707 Acres. The defendant No.1 had also executed a power of attorney in favour of the
plaintiff. In the said deed, the deed was referred to as irrevocable. The plaintiff had instituted a suit
praying for cancellation of the agreement entered into between the parties and also for cancellation
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116929415/ 14Mahesh Govindji Trivedi vs Legal Heirs Of Bhagvanji on 5 December, 2013
of the power of attorney. Construing the terms of the agreement, High Court had found that the
power conferred under the deed upon the attorney along with the interest would attract section 202
of the Indian Contract Act. The Supreme Court disagreed with this. The holding of the Supreme
Court, so far relevant for the present discussion, is as under:-
50. We are unable to agree with the approach of the High Court and find substance in the contention
of Mr. Nariman.Clause (17) is in the nature of express stipulation that before delivery of possession,
the contract could be unilaterally terminated. When there is no ambiguity in the clause, the question
of intendment is immaterial. The fact that the clause is couched in a negative form is of no
consequence. The intention is clear from the plain language of clause (17) of the agreement. In the
case in hand, Section 202 has no applicability. It is not a case of agency coupled with interest. No
interest can be said to have been created on account of plaintiff being permitted to prepare the
scheme and take ancillary steps. Plaintiff could not get possession before declaration under Section
21 of the ULC Act. Mr. Dhanuka also contended that the agreement is not determinable is clear from
the conduct of original defendant No.1 and also what he stated in the affidavit-cum-declaration
dated 10th February, 1978 about agreement not being terminable. The contention of learned counsel
is that what original defendant No.1 has said in the said document is his interpreting statement
which is admissible in law and this interpreting statement and also his conduct, clearly shows that
agreement was not terminable by original defendant No.1. Strong reliance has been placed on
Godhra Electricity Co. Ltd. & Anr. v. The State of Gujarat & Anr. [(1975) 2 SCR 42] in particular to
the following passage (at p.36 of AIR): &. &.. &..
16. Shri Shelat has also invited attention of the Court to the case of R.Sandhyarani, w/o T.A... M.
Mylarappa, S/O. Late Mylappa, 2008(1) Kar LJ 524. In that case also, in an appeal before the High
Court, applicability of section 202 was considered. In para-9, the High Court has held, ... &... From
the plain reading of the above Section, it is clear that there is no such wordings as contended by the
learned counsel for the petitioner. Therefore, as soon as the person, who executed the power of
attorney, dies the right given to the power of attorney holder also comes to an end. Therefore, any
registered sale deed executed by the respondent, without any valid title over the property, becomes
void. &...
17. Shri Shelat has also drawn attention to the case of Manubhai Prabhudas Patel and others v.
Jayantilal Vadilal Shah and Ors. 2012(1) GLH
565. The defendant s application for amendment of pleadings for incorporating the challenge
pertaining to section 202 of the Contract Act came to be rejected by the trial Court. Being aggrieved
by the said rejection, defendant had filed petition under Article 227 of the Constitution. This Court
while allowing the petition has held that assignment of interest in the subject matter to the agent
must be simultaneous with creation of power in him in order to make the deed as irrevocable power
of attorney. In the said case, this Court has held as under:-
18. Thus, mere use of the word `irrevocable in a Power of Attorney will not make the Power of
Attorney irrevocable unless the terms thereof, disclose that it created or recognized an agency
coupled with interest in favour of the Agent. For example, a power of attorney simplicitor, which
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116929415/ 15Mahesh Govindji Trivedi vs Legal Heirs Of Bhagvanji on 5 December, 2013
merely authorizes an Agent, to do certain acts, in the name of or on behalf of the excutant can be
revoked or cancelled by the excutant at any time, in spit of the instrument stating that the Power of
Attorney is irrevocable. On the other hand, a Power of Attorney executed in favour of an Agent,
recording or recognizing an interest of the Agent/Attorney, in the property which is the subject
matter of the Agency, cannot be revoked or terminated, even if the instrument does not state
specifically that it is irrevocable, as then, it would be a power coupled with an interest (Section 202
of the Contract, 1872) .
18. Shri Shelat has also invited attention of the Court to the law laid down in Bowstead and Reynolds
on Agency, Seventeenth Edition by F.M.B.Reynolds. The relevant part of the said decision is quoted
hereunder:-
Irrevocability at common law. The dominant assumption in the cases is that a grant of authority is of
its nature revocable. The mere fact that a power is declared in the instrument granting it to be
irrevocable does not make it so, even if that instrument is a deed. Authority can be irrevocable; but
this is only where the notion of agency is employed as a legal device for a different purpose from that
of normal agency, to confer as security or other interest on the agent .
The circumstances in which authority is thus irrevocable a common law are, however, difficult to
define. The history of this part of the law remains obscure. Authority is only irrevocable where it
accompanies a security or proprietary interest, or is a part of it or a means of achieving it, or,
apparently, where it secures an obligation owed by principal to agent. The fact that the agent
subsequently acquires an interest in the property is irrelevant: to be irrevocable the authority must
be conferred as part of, or as, protection of the agent s interest.
19. It would appear from the above that if the interest in favour of the donee is created in the deed of
power of attorney or if such interest is passed on in favour of donee, then such deed becomes
irrevocable and even the death of donor would have no vitiating effect or consequence on the deed.
It may also be noted that creation of such interest need not necessarily be in the deed of power of
attorney itself and expression of such creation of interest or recognition of interest by the donor may
be in the form of separate deed in this regard. In the other words, donor may have expressed his/her
intention of conferring or creating interest upon the donee by executing separate simultaneous
deed. What is important and determinative is the intention of the donor, and secondly expression of
such intention should be either in the deed of power of attorney itself or in another deed executed
simultaneously. It is for the party who asserts the deed to be irrevocable to show and establish that it
is not revocable in its nature. The burden would be heavier on the party to explain when such
interest is not transferred or created specifically in the said deed and/or when it is not
simultaneously conferred or created. In the present case, it would appear that the donor had
executed power of attorney in favour of donee (deft.no.1) mainly because the donor herself cannot
remain present for execution of transaction in respect of her property and Trust s property. In the
deed (exh.97), the donor has not even remotely expressed an intention to create or transfer any
interest in favour of the donee. In absence of creation or transfer of interest in the property, it
cannot be said that donor intended to execute irrevocable power of attorney. Although the deed in
the heading is referred as irrevocable power of attorney , mere referring and labeling as irrevocable
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116929415/ 16Mahesh Govindji Trivedi vs Legal Heirs Of Bhagvanji on 5 December, 2013
would not make the deed irrevocable. Reading of the deed (Exh.97) leaves no doubt that it is not
irrevocable.
20. It is also to be borne in mind that Ramalaxmiben had said to have executed Will in favour of
defendant No.1 and other brothers of the said defendant on 25.7.1996. Much emphasis was placed
by the learned advocate for the respondent on this former Will, which is a registered Will.
Bequeathing the property in favour of defendant No.1 makes rooms for defendant No.1 to urge that
the donor has created interest in favour of donee by executing Will. Apart from the fact that
execution of Will is not simultaneous with the execution of Exh.97,- which alone is sufficient to
reject such submission,- odds in the form of circumstances are heavily against the donee (deft.no.1).
Later execution of another Will in 2001 in favour of the plaintiff considerably weakens such plea of
defendant No.1. In this regard, it would appear from the evidence that neither defendant No.1 nor
other brother had applied for probate in respect of the former Will, while probate application of the
plaintiff in respect of the later Will is pending before Bombay High Court. Further still, execution of
agreement to sell in respect of suit property as early as on 29.11.1997 and execution of sale deed as
late as on 18.4.2007 is not at all explain in the evidence by defendant No.1. In fact, defendant No.1
has not led any evidence before the trial Court. In this regard, it may also be noted that
Ramalaxmiben has died as late as in January, 2004. If Ramalaxmiben had intended to create or
transfer interest in favour of defendant No.1, happening of events in that case would have been in
different order and different sequence and perhaps, this proceeding will not have arisen. In the
circumstances of the case, Exh.97 is not irrevocable power of attorney.
20.1 Finding of learned trial Court on deed becoming irrevocable has no substance and it is
bordering on perverse finding. General reference to it may be made at the end.
21. In view of the above, Jalaram Developer s case reported in 2010(1) GLH 354 cannot be of any
help to the respondent. In Jalaram Developer s case (supra), granting of interim relief below Exh.5
by the trial Court was challenged before this Court. This Court had vacated the interim relief, as the
plaintiff had been silent about huge investment made by the other side and creation of third party
interest in it. Thus, the main question was propriety of granting of injunction by the Court. It is true
that in that case, there was reference to irrevocable power of attorney. However, the Court has
proceeded to consider the case on the footing that deed of power of attorney was irrevocable.
Whether, deed is irrevocable or not was not a issue in that case. Following Head Note would show
that the said case turns on different point.
... &...Sale by irrevocable power of attorney Agreement to sell was executed in favour of the appellant
by M and after his death his irrevocable power of attorney holder executed the registered sale deed
Challenge to the said sale made by the legal heirs of M on the ground that after the death of M sale
deed cannot be executed by a power of attorney holder and further that they have an undivided
share in the property and so also the sale is bad in law The Trial Court allowed the Exh.5 application
and directed the parties to maintain status-quo Setting aside the said order, held, the appellant is
believed to have possession of the suit property Substantial construction has already been carried
out and third parties rights are created The appellant has made huge investments on the suit
property The plaintiff has challenge the registered sale deed but remained silent about the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116929415/ 17Mahesh Govindji Trivedi vs Legal Heirs Of Bhagvanji on 5 December, 2013
development agreement On the aforesaid facts it is further held that legal heirs would not be entitled
to challenge the sale as the possession had already been transferred and their party rights had been
created and, therefore, an agency would not be terminate even after the death of person who has
authorized, more particularly when the same was irrevocable .
22. Now, the submissions of learned advocate Shri Gandhi for the respondent may be considered.
22.1 As referred to above, Shri Gandhi has tried to strike at the root, in the sense that if the
submissions, viz. the plaintiff s right to file suit and maintainability of the suit is/are found
acceptable, then the nature of power of attorney becomes immaterial and irrelevant. If the
submission of Shri Gandhi found acceptance, suit must fail. Shri Gandhi has submitted that the
plaintiff could enforce his right meaningfully only when the plaintiff is granted probate by the
competent Court. It is submitted that the plaintiff s right till the probate is granted to him would be
in the nature of contingent right or inchoate right and the same would be crystallized and would
become enforceable only when the probate is granted to the plaintiff by the competent Court.
22.2 In the present case, the plaintiff has filed the suit without obtaining probate. That being so, the
plaintiff cannot successfully enforce such contingent interest. It was submitted that the plaintiff s
suit would be impliedly barred under section 9 of CPC. Shri Gandhi has drawn attention of the Court
to head Note (a) of the case of Mrs. Hem Nolini Judah v. Mrs. Isolyne Sarojbashini Bose and Ors.,
AIR 1962(2) SC 1471. It reads thus:-
(a) Succession Act (1925), S.213 Property claimed as belonging to testator as legatee under a Will
Alleged will neither probated nor letters of administration obtained in regard to it Claim is barred by
section .
23. The submission that the plaintiff s interest is in the nature of contingent interest is too spacious
submission to be accepted. Law in this regard is well settled. If the plaintiff has otherwise right over
the property, in absence of probate, such right is unenforceable in absence of Probate. However, it
does not bar initiation of any legal proceedings. Such bar is not possible to read under section 9 of
CPC nor such bar is possible to infer on the ground that the nature of the plaintiff s right in such a
situation is contingent. This submission has no substance. It may be stated that in Mrs. Hem Nolini
s case (supra), one Dr. Miss Mitter s house was in issue. It was suit property. She had died in 1925.
She had left behind her three sisters and her mother. The plaintiff had filed a suit seeking
declaration that she is the owner of the house. The say of the plaintiff was that Dr. Miss Mitter had
made a Will in favour of one of the sisters, i.e. Momin, in 1921 and Momin had made gift of the said
property to the plaintiff. As against that, it was the case of the defendant-appellant that said Dr.
Miss Mitter had made Will in favour of her mother in 1925 and the mother, in turn, had made Will
in 1930 in favour of defendant. Now, the defendant-appellant had obtained letters of administration
of the Will of the mother, i.e. 1930 Will. However, it was not in dispute that no probate or letters of
administration was ever obtained by the mother of the appellant in respect of 1925 Will. It is
non-obtaining of probate or letters of administration of Will, that is said to have been in favour of
mother of the defendant, that came in the way of the defendant-appellant. The basis of the appellant
s claim was Will made in favour of her by her mother. Since the said later Will was unprobated Will,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116929415/ 18Mahesh Govindji Trivedi vs Legal Heirs Of Bhagvanji on 5 December, 2013
law as referred to in head note (a) came to be laid down. Bar under section 213 hits to both- to the
plaintiff and to the defendant. This would show that Miss Hem Nolini s case (supra) cannot help the
respondent.
24. Shri Gandhi has also submitted that stranger to the contract cannot sue. Drawing attention to
pages 23 & 24 of the paper-book, i.e. agreement to sell, and pages 25 & 26 (additional deed), it was
submitted that in the former deed it is clearly stated that possession is handed over and in the latter
deed, it is clarified that possession is received by the purchaser and full consideration is paid. In
view of such deeds on record, a person who is stranger to the contract, cannot successfully challenge
the suit transaction. This submission is totally misplaced and has no substance. A stranger to the
contract, if he is the real owner of the said property, can certainly challenge the transaction of the
property of which he claims to be the owner. Generally speaking, any transaction in respect of any
immovable property, executed to the exclusion of real owner cannot affect, in any way, the right of
the real owner to question the transaction. The submission that stranger to the contract cannot sue
has no substance.
25. Shri Gandhi has drawn attention to Gandabhai Ranchhodbhai s case, 1993(2) GLH 463, therein
purchaser of property, who had purchased the property from the legatees to whom original owner
had bequeathed the property, had instituted suit for eviction against tenant on the ground, inter
alia, of denial of title by tenant. Head Note of this case would show that it does not help to the
submissions of the learned advocate for the respondent.
(B) Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 S. 12(1) Disclaimer or denial of
little of landlord- Transfer of Property Act, 1972- S. 111(g)(2) Indian Evidence Act, 1972-S.116 Indian
Succession Act, 1925- S.213- Denial by tenant of title of the landlord Plaintiff claiming to have
purchased the property by sale deed executed by legatees who were bequeathed the suit property by
the original landlord- Notice of attornment served on the tenant by plaintiff claiming to be landlord-
Tenant in reply asking for copy of Will, Probate, etc. and also showing willingness to pay rent on
plaintiff establishing derivative title Copies asked for not supplied to the tenant- In such
circumstances, in the absence of plaintiff s establishing title, they were not entitled to decree for
possession on the ground of denial of title by tenant .
26. Relying on the case of Somabhai Bholidas Patel (Decd.)) through Legal Heirs Kalpeshbhai
Natwarlal Patel & Ors v. State of Gujarat & Anr., 2009(3) GLR 2645, it was vehemently urged that
when the original owner, i.e. Ramalaxmiben, has not challenged the transaction during her lifetime,
any one who claims to derive the right or interest through Ramalaxmiben cannot challenge the
transaction. Somabhai Patel s case (supra) is the case under the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural
Lands Act, 1948. Sections 32G & 32P came up for consideration of this Court. In that case, the
petitioners were legal representatives of deceased Somabhai Patel. The petitioners were litigating
through power of attorney holder. Deceased Somabhai was cultivating the land bearing survey No.
1270 situated at village Pethapur, District : Gandhinagar since 1956. The revenue authority had
passed some orders in respect of the said land in 1963 and 1969. These orders came in the way of the
petitioner in transferring the land to the third party. Considering the facts and circumstances of the
case, the Court has observed that orders of 1963 and 1969 were not challenged even by Somabhai
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116929415/ 19Mahesh Govindji Trivedi vs Legal Heirs Of Bhagvanji on 5 December, 2013
during his lifetime. This Court has observed in para-8 as under:-
8. The petition does not merit acceptance for the reasons that follow hereinafter. It is an accepted
position that both the orders made on 5.4.1963 and 31.1.1969 respectively, under sections 32G and
32P of the Act, were made against deceased Somabhai and though the exact date of death of the said
gentleman is not available, the said orders were never challenged by deceased Somabhai during his
life-time. Apparently, when th petitioners wanted to part with the property they realized that the
orders made in 1963 and 1969 respectively, would not permit them to transfer the property in favour
of third party, the rights of deceased Somabhai having been held to be limited, after the land had
been resumed by the Authority by passing an order in 1963.
The Court found that the order of the year 1969 under challenge by the revenue authority does not
suffer from any legal infirmity and does not call for any interference (para-17). The Court has
concluded thus:
18. To summarise:
Proceedings under Section 32G of the Act dated 5.4.1963 having attained finality, in absence of
challenge within the period of limitation, consequential proceedings under Sec. 32P of the Act
cannot be successfully challenged, and that too without explaining the gross delay which has
occurred in challenging both the sets of proceedings, and a finding being recorded by the Appellate
Authority first condoning the delay .
27. Reliance sought to be placed by analogy on Somabhai Patel s case (supra) is also totally
misplaced. It is for defendant No.1 to explain why the sale deed was not executed till the death of
Ramalaxmiben (i.e. 2004) when the agreement to sell was executed as early as in 1997. Further, sale
deed, in fact, came to be executed as late as in 2007, i.e. after the death of Ramalaxmiben. The
submission that the original owner has not challenged the transaction and, therefore, the person
deriving interest through original owner cannot challenge the transaction, has even no factual basis.
This submission has no substance, nor the case of Somabhai Patel (supra) has any applicability to
the facts of the present case.
28. Relying on Section 204 of the Indian Contract Act, Shri Gandhi has contended that when the
agent has partly exercised the authority in pursuant to the deed of power of attorney, even the
principal cannot revoke the authority. It was submitted that since the agreement to sell was
executed during the lifetime of Ramalaxmiben and part of consideration was received by her,
remaining act done by the agent, i.e. execution of the sale deed, cannot be questioned even by the
principal, i.e. donor, much less by the plaintiff.
29. Section 204 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 reads thus:
204: Revocation where authority has been partly exercised;- The principal cannot revoke the
authority given to his agent after the authority has been partly exercised, so far as regards such acts
and obligations as arise from acts already done in the agency.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116929415/ 20Mahesh Govindji Trivedi vs Legal Heirs Of Bhagvanji on 5 December, 2013
In the facts of the present case, section 204 cannot help the respondent. Apart from the fact that
section 204 protects the acts done by the agent on behalf of the principal, prior to cancellation or
revocation of his authority, respondent cannot defend the present execution of sale deed by invoking
section 204 of the Contract Act. In this context, it may be stated that in the present case, earlier
Ramalaxmiben had issued a public notice in the newspaper wherein she has stated that no
transaction be entered into without her express consent. This public notice was issued in the
newspaper on 28.7.1996 and 8.8.1996. The learned trial Court has not properly appreciated this,
inasmuch as it has discarded this public notice by observing that it was prior to the execution of
deed of power of attorney. It is true that Exh.97 is said to have been executed in 1997. When it
comes to examine the legality and validity of the sale deed executed as late as in 2007, other
circumstances of the case assumes some importance. In this context, public notice issued in the
newspaper and the latter Will said to have been executed in 2001 play some role in appreciating the
deed of power of attorney. Further, when issuance of public notice by Ramalaxmiben is not in
dispute, it is just, natural and logical that Ramalaxmiben would have made some reference to this in
deed while conferring power upon defendant No.1. Section 204 cannot help the respondent. To say
the least, section 204 is not intended to protect the act of the agent, such as in the case on hand, as it
is sought to be urged by defending the execution of sale deed.
30. Shri Gandhi relying on the cases of (1) Munshi Ram and Ors. v. Municipal Committee,
Chheharta, AIR 1979 SC 1250, and (2) State of Gujarat v. Mer Prabhat Ramji, AIR 1991 Gujarat 195,
has urged that the present suit is not maintainable.
In Mer Prabhat Ramji s case (supra), civil suit came to be filed challenging the order of confiscation
of goods passed by the Collector in exercise of powers under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955.
This Court in that case has held that jurisdiction of Civil Court is barred.
Similarly, in Munshi Ram s case (supra), assessment of professional tax on individual partner was
sought to be challenged by filing civil suit. Special remedy is provided under sections 84 & 86 of the
Punjab Municipal Act. That being so, it was held that availability of special remedy excludes the
jurisdiction of civil Court. Reliance placed on this case law is also totally misplaced. The suit of the
plaintiff in the present case, considering the relief claimed by the plaintiff, cannot be held to be
barred, either because special remedy is provided under the Indian Succession Act or because it is
impliedly barred under section 9 of CPC.
31. Shri Gandhi has vehemently urged that in view of section 73 of the Indian Evidence Act, if this
Court compares the signature appearing on page 17 of the paper-book versus signature on page 38
and also the signature appearing on page 19 versus page 38, it would appear that signature of the
deceased is got up one. Learned advocate Shri Gandhi has also invited attention of the Court to page
64 of the paper-book read with Exh.117. It was submitted that if the Court compares this signature,
even prima facie it would appear that signature does not tally. In support of this reliance placed on
Section 73, learned advocate has drawn attention to the cases of (1) Murarilal vs. State of M.P. AIR
1980 SC 531, and (2) Lalit Popli vs. Canara Bank & Ors, AIR 2003 SC 1796. In the latter case, the
bank s employee was dismissed from service on the allegation of misconduct. The allegation was
that the employee was responsible for unauthorized withdrawal from customer s account. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116929415/ 21Mahesh Govindji Trivedi vs Legal Heirs Of Bhagvanji on 5 December, 2013
employee had accepted that there was some lapse on his part, however, he had pleaded that there
was no criminal intent on his part. It is in this context it was observed that, Even to naked eye
mistakes in spelling of `signature were visible and should not have escaped eyes of bank employee
who is supposed to be trained and equipped to notice such glaring mistakes. Nature of work of bank
employee demands vigilance with inbuilt requirement to act carefully. &. &.
Then, in Murarilal s case(supra) observations on Section 73 of the Evidence Act came to be made in
a case wherein appellant was convicted for the offence under section 302 IPC and also for the
offences under section 460 read with sections 34, 457, 380, 392, 394 & 397 IPC. The observations
made on Section 73 in the above case cannot help the respondent. The submission based on Section
73 of the Indian Evidence Act has no substance and it is not possible to enter into exercise of
comparison of signature, as submitted by learned advocate Shri Gandhi. It is unsafe.It may be stated
that in the given case, Court may invoke Section 73 of the Indian Evidence Act to do complete
justice. However, it cannot be pressed into service to relieve the party to the proceedings from
discharging the onus or burden that lies upon it to establish the facts. In other words, onus or
burden of proof that lies upon the party has to be discharged by the said party, or in a given
situation, Court may compare the signature appearing on record. Then, once attempt is made by
party to discharge the burden and thereby relevant material is brought on record, then considering
circumstances of the case, if it is so required to dispel the doubt, the Court may compare the
signature. Thus, it is power conferred upon the Court and not right bestowed upon the party.
Exceptional circumstances or peculiar facts of the case do not make rule. Speaking of case on hand,
submission of the learned advocate Mr.Gandhi is to read two Wills i.e. of 1996 and of 2001 together
and compare the signature of the deceased. It is enough to say that two signatures are not
apparently incomparable in appearance. To draw the conclusion, merely by comparing signatures as
suggested by the learned advocate is hazardous.
32. Strong reliance was also placed on the case of Minaxiben Shashikantbhai Patel (supra). In that
case, this Court has held that probate is not compulsorily required of the Will executed by Hindus
qua the properties situated outside the territories of the original civil jurisdiction of the High Courts
at Calcutta, Madras and Mumbai, for establishing right pursuant to it. It was submitted that in view
of the law laid down in Minaxiben s case (supra), defendant No.1 was not required to obtain any
probate. Further, in contrast to the second Will, former Will is a registered Will. Therefore, on
execution of the Will itself, defendant No.1 acquires right and in exercise of his right, defendant has
entered into the sale transaction. Developing the submission on this line, it was submitted that
under the former Will, all the four brothers have acquired interest and transaction is challenged
only by the plaintiff whose action is not supported by the other brothers. Therefore, the action of the
plaintiff should be appreciated bearing in mind the said fact. Secondly, supporting the findings of
the learned trial Court, it was submitted that upon acquiring of right under the Will, defendant No.1
has duly executed sale deed in favour of other defendants. It is not merely execution of the sale deed,
but full consideration is received by the `seller and possession is handed over to the purchaser.
Thus, interest has duly passed on in favour of third party and, therefore, challenge to the suit
transaction should be appreciated bearing this material aspect in mind.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116929415/ 22Mahesh Govindji Trivedi vs Legal Heirs Of Bhagvanji on 5 December, 2013
33. This submission has also no substance. In Minaxiben Patel s case (supra), a question came up
before this Court for consideration, as the District Collector had refused entering of the name of the
petitioner in the revenue record on the ground that the petitioner had not obtained probate of the
Will. It may be stated that in the revenue proceedings, legal heirs of the deceased had given consent
for mutation of entry in favour of the petitioner. This Court upon considering section 213 of the
Indian Succession Act and the principles laid down in Clarence Pais and others v. Union of India,
AIR 2001 SC 1151, has held that probate is not required. Reliance placed on the case of Minaxiben
Patel (supra) is misplaced mainly because the law laid down in that case is mixed up by the
respondent with several other points. It is one thing to say that in respect of former Will executed by
Ramalaxmiben, defendant No.1 is not required to obtain probate, however, it is quite different thing
to say that sale deeds executed by defendant No.1, which are under challenge, are legal and valid in
view of law down in Minaxiben s case (supra). Question mark on the validity of suit transaction and
on competency of defendant No.1 to execute said deed is placed by plaintiff not on the ground that
defendant No.1 has entered into transaction without obtaining probate.
34. In Clarence Pais s case (supra), on which this Court has placed reliance in Minaxiben s case
(supra), analyzing section 213 of the Indian Succession Act, the Supreme Court has laid down as
under:-
(1) it prohibits recognition of rights as an executor or legatee under a will without production of a
probate;
(2) it sets down a rule of evidence and forms really a part of procedural requirement of the law of
forum;
(3) the bar that is imposed by this section is only in respect of the establishment of the right as an
executor or legatee and not in respect of establishment of the right in any other capacity;
the section does not prohibit the Will being looked into for purposes other than those mentioned in
the section;
(5) the bar to the establishment of the right is only for its establishment in a Court of justice and not
its being referred to in other proceedings before administrative or other Tribunal; and (6) the
section is a bar to everyone claiming under a will, whether as a plaintiff or a defendant, if no probate
or Letters of Administration is granted .
35. Will, in order to be valid and effective, has to be last Will. In the present case, Ramalaxmiben has
said to have executed another Will in 2001. In view of the fact that the deceased has executed
subsequent Will, decision in the case of Minaxiben Patel (supra) cannot help much to the
respondent. Further, it is also possible to distinguish said decision on the ground that bar that
executor or legatee would face either in enforcing or defending the right in absence of probate is
only before the Court. Bar under section 213 has no application before revenue authority.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/116929415/ 23Mahesh Govindji Trivedi vs Legal Heirs Of Bhagvanji on 5 December, 2013
36. The present appeal succeeds, as defendant No.1 has sought to transfer the suit property through
deed of power of attorney, which is not irrevocable and which is unenforceable/defective power of
attorney deed, hence, in the circumstances of the case, no right, title or interest is passed in favour of
defendant No.2 and consequently nor in favour of defendant Nos.3 to 6.
(2) as defendant Nos.3 to 6 are not bona fide purchasers for value without notice. Almost all
material circumstances are against defendant Nos.3 to 6. Filing of application by plaintiff claiming
breach of undertaking by defendant No.2, then, the fact that son of defendant No.2 is an advocate
practicing along with and under the advocate for defendant No.2. Then the say of defendant No.5 in
his evidence, all these are possible to read in favour of the plaintiff.
(3) as the findings of the learned trial Court,-except the finding that the suit is bad for not praying
relief of possession,- are not only bad in law and illegal, but almost all of them are perverse.
37. The learned trial Court has laboured hard to draw the conclusion that transaction under
challenge had taken place in presence of deceased Ramalaxmiben. The overwhelming circumstances
of the case that points towards different direction, ignored or not properly appreciated by the trial
Court, while no evidence is led on behalf of defendant No.1, appreciation of other evidence is grossly
erroneous. Hence, its finding is perverse. Fine attempt made by the learned advocate Shri Gandhi to
support the finding of the trial Court by covering and connecting this finding with legal submission
fails, as facts and circumstances of the case do not help the learned advocate.
38. In view of the above discussion, the appeal succeeds. The judgment and decree passed by the
learned trial Court in Special Civil Suit No. 86/2007 is hereby quashed and set aside.
39. The submission made by the learned advocate for the respondent that since the prayer for
possession was made by the appellant-plaintiff only at the appellate stage, therefore, even if the
appellant-plaintiff succeeds on merits, prayer for possession ought not to be considered, as the
prayer is made by the appellant at a belated stage, has no substance. A submission was also made
that discretion in favour of the appellant ought not to be exercised. This submission of the learned
advocate for the respondent is also not possible to accept. It may be stated that earlier the suit land
was said to be in possession of one Ishwarlal, who claimed to be tenant. Said Ishwarlal had litigated
upto the High Court and had lost before this Court. It is the say of the appellant-plaintiff that in view
of pendency of litigation initiated by Ishwarlal, the appellant-plaintiff had not prayed for relief for
possession. As observed above, before this Court an application for amendment of plaint was moved
and this Court has allowed the said application. The said order of allowing the application has
become final. Once the said application is allowed by passing a suitable order of awarding costs to
the respondent, it cannot be said that prayer for possession should not be taken into consideration
by this Court even if this Court is of the view that appeal is to be allowed, nor there are
circumstances in favour of the respondent to refuse relief in favour of the appellant. Hence, the
appeal succeeds. The judgment and decree passed by the learned trial Court is hereby quashed and
set aside. The Appeal is allowed with costs.

40. Learned Senior Advocate Shri Shelat has drawn attention of the Court to the case of Binapani
Kar Chowdhury v. Satyabrata Basu & Anr., AIR 2006 SC 2263, wherein, in an identical situation, it
was held thus:
8. Therefore, with a view to do complete justice between the parties, it is appropriate to direct the
trial court (Civil Judge, Senior Division, Alipore) where T.S.No.10/1995 is pending to proceed to
hear arguments and deliver judgment in the suit. Nothing further will be required, if the suit is to be
dismissed. But if the suit is to be decreed, the trial Court should make it clear that the judgment and
decree will come into effect only on the first respondent obtaining and producing the probate of the
Will, and till then the decree should be considered only as provisional and not to be given effect. We
disposed of this appeal accordingly making it clear that nothing stated above is an expression of any
opinion on merits of the case.
In view of the above, the view of the learned Single Judge in Raichand Dhanji v. Jivraj Bhavanji &
Ors, AIR 1932 Bombay 13, cannot be of much assistance to the respondent. Emphasis was placed on
the following holding;-
The practice under which the Court passes a decree in a suit by the executor or the legatee but gives
a direction that the decree is not to be sealed until probate is granted, is not correct.
It may also be stated that the learned Single Judge of this Court in Gandabhai s case (supra), 1993(1)
GLR 238 referred above has taken identical view on this. Identical to Binapani s case (supra).
41. In view of the above, the judgment and decree passed in favour of the appellant-plaintiff would
come into operation and effect only if probate for which the appellant-plaintiff has applied, is
granted by the probate Court. Till the probate is granted to the appellant-plaintiff, the decree passed
herein should be considered only provisional and would not be given effect to.
42. Since the main appeal is disposed of, Civil Application No. 5374/2013 does not survive and
stands disposed of accordingly.
Civil Application No. 7799/2013 stands allowed.
43. At this stage, learned advocate Mr. Gandhi for the respondent prays for stay of operation of the
judgment for eight weeks. The judgment passed by this Court, as stated above, is in sense
provisional. All the same, operation of the judgment is stayed for a period of six weeks from today.
