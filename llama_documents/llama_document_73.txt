THIS WRIT PETITION (CIVIL) HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 04.09.2018,
ALONG WITH WP(C).28226/2007, THE COURT ON 26.09.2018 DELIVERED THE
FOLLOWING:
P.V.ASHA, J.
W.P.(C) No.28226 of 2007 & 25723 of 2013
Dated this the 26th day of September, 2018
JUDGMENT
The petitioners who are retired/serving members of the Kerala Public Service Commission ("PSC"
for short) are aggrieved by the amendment effected to Clause (2) of Regulation 4 of the Kerala
Public Service Commission (Composition and Conditions of Service of Members and Staff)
Regulations, 1957, on account of which their pay is fixed after deducting the pension they were
drawing by virtue of the service rendered by them under the State Government/Public Sector
Undertakings/aided Colleges.
2. Petitioners in W.P.(C) No.25723 of 2013 were appointed as Members of the Commission on
various dates in 2010, 2011 and 2013. One of the petitioners in W.P. (C) No.28226 of 2007 had
already retired in 2007 and the other petitioners therein were sitting members at the time of filing
the writ petition in 2007. They are aggrieved by the amendment effected in 2002 which took away
the benefit which was conferred by the earlier W.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE amendment
effected in 1998, based on which the members started getting the benefit of full pay as well as
pension attached to the post in which they were working prior to their appointment as members of
PSC.
3. The appointment of the Chairman and members of PSC are governed by Article 316 of the
Constitution of India. As per the Proviso to Article 316, one half of the members of the PSC shall be
persons who at the date of their respective appointments have held office for at least 10 years either
under the Government of India or under the Government of the state. Clause 2 provides that a
member of PSC of a state shall hold office for a term of 6 years from the date of assumption of office
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169098754/ 2K.Premarajan vs State Of Kerala on 26 September, 2018
or until he attains the age of 62 years whichever is earlier. Clause 3 provides that a person who holds
office as a member of the PSC shall on the expiration of his term of office be ineligible for
reappointment to the office. Article 318 provides that in the case of a State Commission, the
Governor of the state may, by regulation determine the number of members of the Commission and
their conditions of service; it further W.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE provides that conditions of
service of a member of PSC shall not be varied to his disadvantage after his appointment. Under
Article 319, the Chairman as well as members of the State Public Service Commission shall be
ineligible for any other employment either under the Government of India or under the Government
of the state. Under Article 322, the expenses of the state PSC including any salary, allowances and
pensions payable to or in respect of members or staff the commission shall be charged on the
Consolidated fund of the state.
4. The Governor of Kerala has framed the Kerala Public Service Commission (Composition and
Conditions of Service of Members and Staff) Regulations, 1957 (hereinafter referred to as
'Regulations'), in exercise of powers conferred under Article 318 of the Constitution of India. As per
regulation 4 of these regulations, the salary of the Chairman and other members were fixed as
Rs.22,850/- per month and Rs.22,500/- per month respectively (since revised) along with DA and
City Compensatory Allowance at the W.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE rates admissible to the
officers of the State Govt. As per clause 2 of regulation 4 it was provided that a member who was
holding a post under the Govt. of India or a State shall on appointment as Chairman or other
member receive salary and DA as mentioned in clause (1). However as per the proviso they would be
allowed to draw their salary last drawn in Govt. of India service or State Govt. service minus the
pension including commuted value of pension and the pension equivalent of other retirement
benefits throughout the period of their service in the Commission if the last pay drawn by them
during such service is higher than the pay attached to the posts. Sub clause (ii) of Clause 2 of that
regulation further provides that the salary mentioned in clause (1) shall be reduced by such amount
not exceeding the pension and the pension equivalent of other retirement benefits if any in case of
appointment as Chairman or other member of a person who has retired or deemed to have retired
from service under the Government, a Local Body, a University or Private College or an Aided
School or any other body W.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE wholly or substantially owned or
controlled by the Government.
5. Relevant portion of Regulation 4 reads as follows:
"(1) There shall be paid to the Chairman a salary at the rate of twentytwo thousand
eight hundred and fifty rupees per mensum and to other members at the rate of
twentytwo thousand five hundred rupees per mensum. Chairman and other members
shall also be paid Dearness Allowance and City Compensatory Allowance at the rates
admissible to the officers of the State Government drawing equivalent pay:
xxxxxxx (2) A person who holds at the time of his appointment to the Commission is
holding a post in the Government of India or Government of a State shall on
appointment as Chairman or other Member, receive the Salary and Dearness
Allowance mentioned in Clause (1): Provided that such person shall be allowed to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169098754/ 3K.Premarajan vs State Of Kerala on 26 September, 2018
draw his salary last drawn in the Government of India service, the All India Service or
the State service, as the case may be, minus pension including commuted value of
pension and pension equivalent to other retirement benefits throughout the period of
his service in the Commission if the last pay drawn by him during such service is
higher than the pay attached to the posts: xxxxxxx (ii} In the case of an appointment
as Chairman or other member, of a person who has retired or deemed to have retired
from service under the Government or local body, a University or a private college or
an aided school or any other body wholly or substantially owned or controlled by
government and who is on receipt or has received or has become entitled to receive
any retirement benefits by way of pension, gratuity, contributory provident fund or
otherwise his salary as mentioned in clause (1) shall be reduced by such amount not
exceeding the pension (including any portion of the pension which may have been
commuted) and pension equivalent of other retirement benefits if any.xxxxx"
6. Before the appointment of petitioners as Members of the Commission, the 1st petitioner in
W.P.(C) W.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE No.28226 of 2007 retired from service of State
Government; the 2nd petitioner retired from a teaching post in an aided College and 3rd petitioner
retired from the University of Calicut. Petitioners 1 and 2 in W. P. (C) No.25723 of 2012 retired from
service under the State Government and petitioners 3 to 5 retired from teaching posts in aided
colleges. The grievance of the petitioners is that the regulations were once amended in 1998,
pursuant to the judgment of the apex court in D.S Nakara V Union of India: AIR 1983 SC 130, for
grant of full salary and full pension to the Chairman and Members irrespective of the pension which
they were drawing on account of the past service. Prior to amendment in 2002, sub-clause (ii) of
clause (2) of Regulation 4, which was incorporated in the Regulations as per GO(P) No.648/98/GD
dated 15.12.1998 (which is produced as Ext.P2 in W.P.(C) No.28226 of 2007) reads as follows:
(ii) in the case of an appointment as Chairman or other member, of a person who has
retired or deemed to have retired from service under the Government or local body, a
University or a Private College or an aided school or any other body wholly or
substantially owned or controlled by government and who is on receipt or has
received or has become entitled to receive any W.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE
retirement benefits by way of pension, gratuity, contributory provident fund or
otherwise his salary shall be as mentioned in clause 1 and he shall be eligible to
receive such retirement benefits."
7. The amendment brought about in 1998 enabling the Chairman and Members to draw pension as
well the salary without any deduction was nullified in 2002, restoring the position as existed prior to
1998, as per Ext.P3 order issued on 23.10.2002 restoring the position prior to 1998, in tune with the
provisions contained in Rule 100 of Part III KSR.
8. Thus the grievance of the petitioners who are pensioners by virtue of the service rendered by
them under the Govt.of Kerala/ Private aided Colleges/University is that salary was being paid to
them after deducting the amount equivalent to the pension they were drawing and they were getting
only a meagre amount towards salary though they are members of a Constitutional body. The matter
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169098754/ 4K.Premarajan vs State Of Kerala on 26 September, 2018
was taken up by the PSC before the Government pointing out that the attitude shown towards the
petitioners who are members of a constitutional body by treating them on par with those holding
civil posts under the Government, was not W.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE proper. However
Government rejected the request of the petitioners as well as that of the PSC. The writ petitions are
filed under the above circumstances seeking a declaration that the amendment brought about to
subclause (ii) of Clause (2) of Regulation 4 by way of Ext.P3 is unconstitutional pointing out that the
members of the PSC cannot be equated to those holding civil posts under the Government so as to
invoke Rule 100 of Part III KSR in fixing their pay.
9. According to the petitioners appointment of half of the members of the PSC are made from
among those who have rendered 10 years service in State/Central Government as per Article 316 of
the Constitution of India. Therefore they cannot be treated as reemployed persons.
10. Respondents have filed a counter affidavit stating that the pay of the petitioners were fixed
deducting the pension they were drawing as revised from time to time. It is stated that they have
opted to draw pension attached to the post they were holding prior to their appointment as
Members of PSC, under clause 7A W.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE (2) of the Regulations. It is
stated that the amendment to regulation 4(2) was made subsequent to the modification to rule 100
of Part III KSR which dispensed with the practice of getting dual benefit of pension and salary at the
same time on the reappointment of retired Govt. servant to the post of Chairman and members of
PSC. The amendment was effected only prospectively. They get the same emoluments attached to
the post of members/Chairman minus the pension attached to their previous service and there
would not be any difference in the net emoluments. As a matter of public policy Govt. had stopped
the practice of granting dual benefits of pension and salary. Rule 100 was amended and
consequential amendment was made in sub clause(ii) of Clause 2 of regulation 4 of the Regulations
prospectively in order to ensure that it is not ultravires the provisions of the Constitution. As per
Regulation 4 the pension and pensionary benefits equivalent to retirement benefits had to be
deducted from the reemployment salary which was adopted in rule
100. Though certain amendments were effected subsequent W.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE to
the judgment of the Apex court in D.S. Nakara V Union of India: AIR 1983 SC 130, Rule 100 was
amended and the same was incorporated in the Regulations.
11. In the counter affidavit by PSC in WP(C) No. 25723 of 2013, it is stated that the Chairman and
members of the Commission who were appointed to hold constitutional posts cannot be treated on
par with employees appointed under the Public Services or other Acts or Rules and therefore there is
no question of extension of rule 100 of Part III KSR, which applies only in the case of those retired
officers who are employed in Public Services after retirement from such services under Government.
Therefore it is illogical to treat them as re-employed pensioners for the purpose of regulating their
service conditions. The power to fix the conditions of service is vested only in the Governor of the
State under Article 318 of the Constitution of India. Persons like petitioners appointed to a
constitutional body are entitled to draw pensionary benefits by way of the service rendered by them
and it is their statutory entitlement that cannot W.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE be reckoned as
part of the salary due to them for their service as member/Chairman. The salary of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169098754/ 5K.Premarajan vs State Of Kerala on 26 September, 2018
members/Chairman is charged on the consolidated fund whereas pension and gratuity is admissible
for past service is subject to vote by the legislature. It is also pointed out that MLAs, MPs etc. who
receive pension from consolidated funds would continue to get full salary. It is also pointed out that
the duties and functions of the Chairman and members of the Commission are one and the same
irrespective of the source from which they are appointed that is whether they were employed or not
before their appointment as members.
12. The learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners relied on the judgment of this Court in WP(C)
No.11560 of 2012 and WP(C) No.3081 of 2013 and argued that petitioners cannot be treated as mere
re- employed hands and they are entitled to enjoy special privilege, being members of a
constitutional body.
13. The learned Government Pleader relied on the judgments in Gopinatha Pillai vs. State of Kerala :
2004 (3) KLT 290, V.S.Mallimath vs. Union of India and W.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE
another : 2001 (4) SCC 31, M.S.chawla and others vs. State of Punjab and another : 2001 (5) SCC
358 , Guru Gobinda Basu vs. Sankari Prasad Ghosal : AIR 1964 SC 254, Confederation of
Ex-Servicemen Associations and others vs. Union of India and others : 2006 (8) SCC 399, Pashupati
Nath Sukul vs. Nem Chandra Jain : 1984 (2) SCC 404 and Ashraf M. vs. State of Kerala and others :
2013 (2) KHC 559 and argued that the petitioners who are re-employed pensioners are entitled to
get pay only after deducting the pension they are drawing.
14. Heard Sri.Jaju Babu, learned Senior Counsel appearing for petitioner in W.P.(C) No.25273 of
2013, Sri.S.P.Aravindakshan Pillai, the learned Counsel for the petitioners in W.P.(C) No.28226 of
2007, Sri. Kannan, learned Government Pleader and Sri.P.C. Sasidharan, the learned Standing
Counsel for the PSC.
15. The question arising in these cases is whether the pension drawn by petitioners by virtue of the
service rendered by them as employees under the State Government, aided Colleges and University
can be W.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE deducted from the pay attached to that of the Member of
PSC.
16. From the pleadings it is clear that till the issuance of Ext.P2 in 1998 and thereafter from 2002,
the pay of the members who were drawing pension was being fixed after deducting the pension
equivalent. It would also appear that none of the petitioners have enjoyed the benefit of Ext.P2
amendment effected in 1998, as all of them appear to have been appointed as Members subsequent
to the amendment effected in 2002. Whatever it may be it is necessary to examine whether pension
being drawn by petitioners was liable to be deducted from the pay attached to the post.
17. All the petitioners are drawing pension by virtue of the service rendered by them in either State
Government or aided Colleges/University. Pension is sanctioned to them and the pension
sanctioned to them is regulated under the provisions contained in Part III KSR, as provided in Rule
1(a) of Part III KSR. In other words all of them are governed by Part III KSR, based on which they
continue to draw pension. Chapter VII of W.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE the KSR deals with
re-empoyment of pensioners. Under Rule 92 of Part III KSR every employee who is re- employed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169098754/ 6K.Premarajan vs State Of Kerala on 26 September, 2018
should be specifically called to the provisions of this chapter by the authority re- employing him, and
by the Audit Officer whenever he becomes aware of such an appointment. Rule 92 is applicable to
any pensioner drawing pension under Part III, irrespective of the post in which one is re- employed/
appointed after retirement. Rule 100 as it existed prior to 22.09.2009 reads as follows:
The pay of a re-employed pensioner will be fixed at an amount equal to the difference
between the pay drawn by him at the time of his retirement and pension and pension
equivalent of other forms of retirement benefits admissible to him, limited however,
to the minimum of the scale of pay of the post of re-employment, provided that the
pay plus pension and pension equivalent of other forms of retirement benefits shall
not exceed Rs.3,500. He will also be allowed to draw the full pension in addition to
the pay so fixed but will not be given temporary or adhoc increase in pension. He will
get the basic pension besides the re-employment pay fixed under the rule plus full
Dearness Allowance on the re-employment pay. No increment will be earned during
the period of re-employment, except in the case of military pensioners re-employed
in civil posts."
18. After the amendment in 2009, relevant portion of Rule 100 reads as follows:
The pay of the re-employed State Government employee whoretired from a post with
pay scales currently in force will be the pay drawn at the time of retirement minus
basic pension. In the case of others the pay drawn at the time of retirement would
updated and fixed at the appropriate stage W.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE in the
scale of pay of the post held at the time of retirement or the scale of pay of the post of
re-employment as the case may be, if it is a stage.xxxxxRe-employed pensioners are
entitled to the benefit of dearness allowance, city compensatory allowance, House
Rent Allowance applicable from time to time on the pay before reducing pension but
are not entitled to dearness relief on pension. They will also be entitled to the benefit
of annual increment with effect from first April 1992. Re- employed pensioners are
not eligible for stagnation increments."
19. In the case of the petitioners the Regulation governing them has incorporated the provisions in
Rule
100. But even in a case where there was no such provision under the Kerala Consumer Protection
Rules, this court in the judgment in Gopinatha Pillai vs. State of Kerala : 2004 (3) KLT 290 held that
Rule 100 will apply to a pensioner who is re-employed. It was held that the appointment of a District
Judge as President of the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum cannot be said to be not a
re-employment. In Gopinatha Pillai's case a retired District Judge who was appointed as the
President of the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum claimed that he is entitled to the pay attached
to the post of President of CDRF, as provided in the Consumer Protection Act and the Rules framed
under it. In the light of the judgment in M.S.Chawla and others vs. State of Punjab and another :
2001 (5) W.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE SCC 358 this court found that the pay has to be fixed in
accordance with rule 100 of Part III KSR in the case of any re-employed pensioner. The judgments
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169098754/ 7K.Premarajan vs State Of Kerala on 26 September, 2018
in State of Kerala vs. Govindankutty : 1999 (2) KLT 746 and Govindankutty vs. State of Kerala: 1996
(2) KLT 1007 was held not good law in the light of the judgment in M.S.Chawla's case. It was held
that the provisions contained in Consumer Protection Act or Rules cannot have any overriding effect
over Rule 100 of Part III KSR, in fixing the pay of re-employed pensioners, according to which the
pay of the re-employed pensioner has to be fixed at an amount equal to the difference between the
pay drawn by him at the time of his retirement and pension equivalent of other forms of retirement
benefits admissible to him. Referring to rule 1 (a) of Chapter I of Part III KSR the Division Bench
observed that pension of all employees to whom the Kerala Service Rules apply would be regulated
by the provisions in the general rules. Therefore the authority competent to fix the pay and
allowances of the post to which the pensioner is re-employed has to W.P.(C)
No.25723/13&CON./CASE determine whether the pension shall be claimed wholly or partly and pay
would have to be fixed on re- employment at an amount equal to the difference between the last pay
drawn and pension admissible subject to the minimum of the scale of pay of the post of re-
employment with a maximum limit of Rs.3500/-. It was held that though the President of CDRF
was appointed under Sec.10 of the Consumer Protection Act, he continued to be a pensioner
governed by the Kerala Service Rules; the contention that Consumer Protection Act is a central
enactment and therefore Rule 100 of Part III KSR could not have overriding power was repelled.
This Court found that as long as the President of the CDRF continued to be a pensioner governed by
the provisions contained in the KSR his re- appointment pay would be governed by rule 100 of Part
III KSR and that the provisions of Consumer Protection Rules would not have any overriding effect
in the matter of pay and allowances.
20. In M.S.Chawla's case the provisions under the Consumer Protection Act was considered with
reference W.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE to Punjab Civil Service Rules which contain provisions
in pari materia with those in KSR and the apex court found that the pension of the superannuated
District Judges were governed by the Punjab Civil Service Rules which provides for fixation of pay
on re-employment. It was also held that the appointment of a District Judge after his retirement
cannot be said to be not a re- employment.
21. 10. In V.S.Mallimath vs. Union of India and another : 2001 (4) SCC 31 the apex court considered
the claim of the retired Chief Justice of this court for computation of salary in the post of Member of
the National Human Rights Commission, without deduction of pensionary benefits. But it was
found that the pension received towards the service rendered as Chief Justice of High Court must be
treated as service in connection with the affairs of the Union and the same was deductible under
Rule 3(b) of National Human Rights Commission Chairperson and Members (Salaries, Allowances
and other Conditions of Service) Rules, 1993. The writ petition was filed when salary was paid
W.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE to him only after deducting the pensionary benefits. As per rule
3(b) of the National Human Rights Commission Chairperson and Members (Salaries, Allowances
and other Conditions of Service) Rules, 1993 a member is eligible for salary equal to that of a Judge
of the Supreme Court. Under the proviso a member who is in receipt of pension in respect of any
previous service under the Government of the Union or Government of a State, his salary shall stand
reduced to the extent of the pension being drawn. Paragraph 4 of the judgment would show that a
contention was raised on behalf of the petitioner that the petitioner was holding the post of Chief
Justice of the High Court which is a constitutional post and therefore no deduction can be made,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169098754/ 8K.Premarajan vs State Of Kerala on 26 September, 2018
pointing out that the service rendered as a Chief Justice cannot be said to be service under the
Union or of a State. But those contentions were not accepted in view of rule 3 (b) observing that a
Judge of a High Court belonging the third organ of the State, which is independent of the other two
organs namely the Executive and the Legislature though occupies a unique W.P.(C)
No.25723/13&CON./CASE position under the Constitution cannot have any impact on fixing the pay
on his appointment as a member of the Human Rights Commission and it would not affect the
independence of the judiciary. It was also observed that the Comptroller and Auditor-General of
India is an officer under the Union Government, as held in Gurugobinda Basu vs. Sankari Prasad
Ghosal : 1964 (4) SCR 311. It was held that the expression Govt. occurring in rule 3(b) has to be
construed in a wider sense and service rendered by a Judge or Chief Justice of High Court must be
held to be a service in connection with the affairs of the Union. There also it was held that in the
absence of any definition to re- employment, it cannot be said that the appointment of the petitioner
as member of the NHRC is not a re- employment.
22. In the present case, it is true that the appointment of 50% of the members is to be done from
among those who were in Central Government or Government of a State. Petitioners are persons
who retired from the service of State Government as well as W.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE
from aided Colleges and University. However all of them are pensioners and they are drawing
pension in accordance with the provisions contained in Part III of Kerala Service Rules. Though the
conditions of their service, on appointment as Members of PSC, are governed by the Regulations, it
cannot be said that they are not drawing pension in terms of the provisions in KSR. As per Rule 1(a)
the pension of all employees to whom KSR applies are regulated by part III. As per Rule 2(ii) of Part
I KSR, the Rules in KSR apply to every person employed in whole time service of Government.
Though Rule 3 of Part I KSR excludes the persons for whom special provision is made governing
their conditions of service, the Regulations, 1957 which govern the service conditions of petitioners
on their appointment as Members, framed under Article 318, incorporate the provisions in Rule 100
of Part III KSR.
23. Article 318 confers power on Governor to regulate the pay and allowances and conditions of
service of the members. No restriction is imposed for exercising this power. The Regulations 1957
including W.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE the amendment carried out to it as per Ext.P3 are
issued with due authority. While laying down the conditions of service provisions are made on par
with rule 100 of Part III KSR, in such a way that the total amount of pension along with the pay does
not exceed the pay admissible to the members of PSC, by deducting the pension from the pay
admissible under clause (1) of Regulation 4. When persons drawing pension are appointed as
members there is nothing wrong in regulating their pay, as per regulation issued on par with Rule
100 of part III KSR. Moreover Rule 92 as well as Rule 100 mandates that the authority appointing a
pensioner on re-employment or the audit officer shall alert such persons of the rules regarding the
pay admissible to them .
24. When Article 316 provides for appointment of half of the members of the Commission from
among those who had 10 years service in State Government or Central Government, nothing is
stated regarding the eligibility for pay or pension to such 50% of the members. Therefore as long as
there is no dispute as to the W.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE authority to frame regulations there
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/169098754/ 9K.Premarajan vs State Of Kerala on 26 September, 2018
is nothing illegal or unconstitutional in regulating the pay of those drawing pension, by way of
Regulations incorporating the principles underlying Rule 100 of Part III KSR limiting their total
emoluments including pay and pension to a sum not less than the pay fixed under Regulation 4(1).
Such a provision is necessary to see that there is parity in pay in the case of all the members
appointed from different sources and to avoid the possible disparity between those appointed from
those with 10 years drawing pension and full pay and those appointed directly without pension but
full pay only.
25. Though the judgments relied on by the learned Government Pleader do not relate to
appointments after retirement to constitutional bodies, when the Regulation 4(2)(ii) itself is issued
incorporating Rule 100, the contention that Rule 100 of part III KSR would not apply to them is
irrelevant. Moreover the ratio of the judgments in Gopinatha Pilla's case, M.S. Chawla's case, Retd
Chief Justice V.S. Malimath's case (supra) W.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE will apply to the
present case on all fours.
26. Though the payment of the salary, allowances and pension of the members of PSC are to be
made from the consolidated fund of the State Government, under Article 322 of the Constitution,
nothing prevents the respondents from framing regulations which restricts the drawing of full salary
along with full pension. Moreover in the light of the dictum laid down in judgment in Gurugobinda
Basu's case (supra) reiterated in V.S. Malimath V Union of India (supra), it cannot also be said that
the petitioners are not governed by KSR on their appointment after retirement as members of PSC.
The fact that amendment was effected in tune with the amendment to Rule 100 does not make the
provision unconstitutional in any manner.
27. In Confederation of Ex-Servicemen Associations and others vs. Union of India and others : 2006
(8) SCC 547, relied on by the learned Government Pleader the apex court was considering the claim
made by ex- servicemen for medical facilities even after retirement. The apex court found that
classification W.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE made between in service defence personnel and
retired defence personnel is reasonable. Apex court considered the contention that the
ex-servicemen cannot be compared with retired Civilian Central Govt. employees. If certain benefits
extended to inservice employees are not extended to retired employees, it cannot be successfully
contended that there is discrimination or violation of Article 14. In case the classification is founded
on an intelligible differentia which must distinguish persons or things that are grouped together and
such a differentia has rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved by the statute or legislation,
it can be said that the classification has fulfilled the twin test. Therefore it was held that the
classification between defence personnel and other than defence personnel is also reasonable. The
public policy underlying Rule 100 of Part III KSR as well as subclause (ii) of Clause (2) of regulation
4 are the same. It cannot be said to suffer from any irrationality or unconstitutionality.
28. At the same time it is pertinent to note that W.P.(C) No.25723/13&CON./CASE such restrictions
were in force except during the period from 1998 to 2002. It would also appear that the
appointments of all the petitioners were subsequent to the amendment in 2002. The issues which
arose in WP(C) No.3081 of 2013 and W.P.(C) No.12560 of 2012 are entirely different.

In the above circumstances, I am of the view that the amendment effected in sub clause (ii) of Clause
(2) of Regulation 4 does not suffer from any unconstitutionality.
The writ petitions are dismissed.
