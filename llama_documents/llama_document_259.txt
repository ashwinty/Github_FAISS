1 These appeals under Section 18 of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act 19971 arise from
the judgments dated 16 September 2015 and 11 December 2018 of the Telecom Disputes Settlement
and Appellate Tribunal 2. The appellant claimed a refund of Rs 1454.94 crores representing the
Entry Fee (together with interest) paid by it for 2G licences for twenty-one service areas. By the
judgment of this Court in Centre for Public Interest Litigation v. Union of India 3 , the 2G licences
which were granted by the Union of India, including to the appellant, were quashed. The appellant
claims to be entitled to the refund of its Entry Fee on, as it contends, ―well settled principles of civil,
contractual and constitutional law(cid:130). 2 The appellant applied for the grant of Unified Access Service
Licences4 for twenty-one service areas on 3 September 2007. A Letter of Intent was issued. The
appellant paid the circle wise Entry Fee of Rs 1.1 crores and furnished a Performance Bank
Guarantee and Financial Bank Guarantee for the twenty-one areas. The appellant entered into UASL
agreements on 3 March 2008 for the twenty-one service areas with the respondent, which came into
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 1Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
effect from 25 January 2008. Among the conditions which were stipulated in the UASL agreements,
those governing the duration of the licence and the Entry Fee were in the following terms:
―TRAI Act(cid:130) ―TDSAT(cid:130) (2012) 3 SCC 1 (―CPIL(cid:130)) ―UASL(cid:130) PART A ―3. Duration of License 3.1 This
LICENCE shall be valid for a period of 20 years from the effective date unless revoked earlier for
reasons as specified elsewhere in the document.
[…]
18. FEES PAYABLE 18.1 Entry Fee:
One Time non-refundable Entry Fee of Rs 1.1 crore has been paid by the LICENSEE prior to signing
of this License agreement.(cid:130) 3 On 2 February 2012, this Court by its judgment in CPIL (supra)
declared that the policy of the Union government for allocation of 2G spectrum on a ―First Come
First Serve(cid:130) basis was illegal. As a consequence, the UASLs which were granted by the Union
government were quashed. On 25 May 2012, the appellant instituted a petition5 before the TDSAT
seeking, among other things, a refund of the Entry Fee of Rs 1454.94 crores, inclusive of interest.
The appellant has stated that on 1 June 2012 it shut down its operations after porting out all its
subscribers. 4 By its judgment dated 16 September 2015, the TDSAT dismissed the First Telecom
Petition holding, inter alia, that:
(i) The quashing of the appellant’s licences by this Court in its judgment in CPIL (supra) cannot be
equated with the UASL agreements becoming void within Petition No 329 of 2012 ("First Telecom
Petition(cid:130)) PART A the meaning of Section 65 of the Indian Contract Act 1872 6 . This Court quashed
the UASLs since it found the Union government’s policy of ―First Come First Serve(cid:130) to be illegal
and arbitrary. Hence, the appellant cannot claim restitution under Section 65;
(ii) The quashing of the appellant’s licences by this Court in its judgment in CPIL (supra) cannot be
brought under the Indian Contract Act, since the UASL agreements had not become void under
Sections 23 and 56 of the Indian Contract Act; and
(iii) Even assuming that the appellant’s UASL agreements became void under the Indian Contract
Act, its claim for restitution under Section 65 would be governed by the principle of in pari delicto
potio rest condition defendentis (in equal fault, better is the condition of the possessor). A refund of
the Entry Fee could not be made until the possibility of the appellant being in pari delicto was
completely effaced. When the TDSAT delivered its judgment, the appellant was facing trial before
the Special Judge, CBI for charges under Section 120-B and 420 of the Indian Penal Code 1860 in a
case relating to the grant of UASLs.
By a judgment dated 21 December 2017, the appellant was acquitted of criminal charges by the
Special Judge, CBI. The Central Bureau of Investigation has filed a ―Indian Contract Act(cid:130) PART A
petition for leave to appeal against the order of acquittal, which is presently pending before the
Delhi High Court.

5 Aggrieved by the judgment of the TDSAT dated 16 September 2015, the appellant moved this
Court in Civil Appeal Nos 1447-1467 of 2016. On 13 May 2016, the appellant sought liberty of this
Court to withdraw the civil appeals, and to approach this Court once again if it became so necessary.
Leave was accordingly granted by this Court.
6 The appellant then instituted another petition before the TDSAT7 raising the issue of a refund of
the Entry Fee, on the ground that it had been exonerated by the Special Judge, CBI. By its judgment
dated 11 December 2018, the TDSAT dismissed the Second Telecom Petition noting that the
appellant had made a second attempt for claiming the same relief which had been sought earlier in
the First Telecom Petition. It further held that had the TDSAT sought to provide the appellant with
the remedy of approaching it after the conclusion of the trial before the Special Judge, CBI, it would
have indicated it in its judgment. Finally, it was also noted that this Court, through its order dated 13
May 2016, did not grant the appellant the leave to approach the TDSAT but only to approach this
Court. Telecom Petition No 63 of 2018 ("Second Telecom Petition(cid:130)) PART B The judgment dated 11
December 2018 has given rise to the filing of the second set of civil appeals 8 by the appellant. The
appellant also moved a Miscellaneous Application 9 in Civil Appeal Nos 1447-1467 of 2016 seeking
permission for the revival of the earlier civil appeals, which had been permitted to be withdrawn on
13 May 2016.
7 By an order dated 7 January 2020, the Miscellaneous Applications seeking the revival of the first
set of civil appeals were allowed, keeping open all the contentions including the contentions of the
respondents based on the earlier order dated 13 May 2016. This judgment will accordingly govern
both, the original set of civil appeals which stand revived in pursuance of the order dated 7 January
2020 and the second set of civil appeals.
B Submissions of Counsel
8 Dr A M Singhvi, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant,
has urged the following submissions:
(i) Since the licences of the appellant were quashed by the judgment of this
Court in CPIL (supra), the appellant is entitled to a refund of its Entry Fee based on civil,
contractual and constitutional principles; Civil Appeal No 893 of 2019 Miscellaneous Application
Nos 198-218 of 2019 PART B
(ii) The appellant paid an Entry Fee of Rs 1454.94 crores for twenty-one service areas and the
licences were valid for a period of twenty years. The appellant was prevented from providing
services under the licences because:
(a) This Court held that respondent’s ―First Come First Serve(cid:130) policy for grant of licences was
flawed, arbitrary and illegal; and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 3Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
(b) As a consequence, licences which were granted under said the policy (including the licences of
the appellant) were quashed;
(iii) The quashing of the licences by this Court amounted to a frustration of each licence, which was
in the nature of a contract, in terms of Section 56 of the Indian Contract Act. Consequently, the
appellant is entitled to a restitution of the Entry Fee paid in terms of Section 65, as the licences were
quashed not on account of the fault of the appellant but due to the culpability of the Union
government;
(iv) The well settled principle is that no person can be prejudiced because of an act of a court (actus
curiae neminem gravabit);
(v) The substratum of TDSAT’s decision which disallowed the claim of the appellant in view of the
pending criminal proceedings has been wiped off by the acquittal of the appellant by the Special
Judge, CBI;
(vi) The set off policy of the Union government, in terms of which a set off of the Entry Fee which
was paid was granted only to those entities who participated in the fresh round of auction which
took place after the judgment of this Court in CPIL (supra), is based on incorrect classification
which lacks intelligible PART B differentia and nexus to its object. Further, the set off policy suffers
from manifest arbitrariness and is discriminatory. Thus, it should be struck down as being violative
of Article 14 of the Constitution;
(vii) The set off policy of the Union government allowing the grant of a set off of the Entry Fee, albeit
to certain bidders, is an admission of a debt that is due and payable:
(a) On 12 October 2012, the respondent issued ―Queries and Responses to an NIA(cid:130) and in answer to
Query Number 74 regarding the set off of Entry Fee, it was stated as follows:
―A set-off is allowed against the Earnest Money and the payment due in the event of spectrum being
won in this auction. The total amount of such set off shall be limited to the total entry fee paid by the
entity for all its licenses which have been quashed by the Supreme Court. No interest will be due on
this amount.(cid:130)
(b) The Empowered Group of Ministers10 held a meeting on 18 October 2012, at which a decision
was taken in the following terms: ―13. The EGoM considered the letter dated 12.10.2012 from the
Minister of Information and Broadcasting regarding set-off of entry fee against the earnest money
and payment due in the event of spectrum being won and noted that the entry fee paid by TSPs
whose licenses were quashed was for a period of 20 years. While on one hand, the TSPs could be
expected to have paid a pro-rata amount for the period of operation of the license, i.e. 2008-2012,
on the other hand, there could be a claim for refund with interest for the pro-rata amount for the
balance period. Therefore, the EGoM decided to allow ―EGoM(cid:130) PART B such TSPs to adjust an
amount equivalent to their full entry fee, without any interest, against the auction payments, both
for participation and/or final payment on successful conclusion. It was clarified that the set-off
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 4Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
would be permitted only to the quashed license holders participating in the auction. Such set-off
would be allowed to the extent of total entry fee paid for all quashed licenses on an aggregate basis
without consideration of the expired period of license, only if they succeed in the auction…(cid:130)
(emphasis supplied)
(c) Pursuant to the above policy of granting a set off, the Union government has granted a set off of
the Entry Fee to Telewings (formerly Uninor), Videocon, Idea Cellular Limited and Sistema Shyam.
In particular, a set off has been granted to Telewings despite there being grave criminal charges
against it including, inter alia, charges under the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988;
(viii) The proposition that the policy of the Union of India to permit the grant of a set off of the
Entry Fee amounts to an admission that a refund of the Entry Fee is payable and due, finds support
in the decision of this Court in Union of India v. Karam Chand Thapar and Bros. (Coal Sales) Ltd.11;
(ix) The non-refund of the Entry Fee to the appellant is discriminatory for the following reasons:
(2004) 3 SCC 504 PART B
(a) A set off towards the fee payable for the spectrum has been permitted to those Telecom Service
Providers12 who participated in and won spectrum in the subsequent auction after the judgment of
this Court in CPIL (supra);
(b) The licences of eight TSPs were quashed by this Court by its judgment in CPIL (supra). There
cannot be any distinction or classification in law between the said eight TSPs and similar treatment
must be afforded to all. The classification based on their decision to participate in the subsequent
auction for refund of Entry Fee is discriminatory and has no nexus with the object sought to be
achieved by the set off policy;
(c) Out of the eight TSPs, four TSPs participated in the subsequent auction and were permitted a set
off of their Entry Fee towards payment for the auction allotted spectrum. Details of the cases where
a set off was granted are:

(cid:12) PART B
(d) TDSAT afforded differential treatment to the appellant due to the pendency of criminal
proceedings against it. In any event, this ground ceases to exist in view of the acquittal of the
appellant of criminal charges on 21 December 2017 by the Special Judge, CBI. Following the
appellant’s acquittal, there is no rationale for denying refund of Entry Fee to the appellant;
(x) The set off policy penalises a business entity for taking a commercial decision not to participate
in the subsequent auction. Whether or not an entity should have participated in the auction of
spectrum following the decision of this Court in CPIL (supra) was entirely for each of them to
determine and this cannot form the basis for granting or denying a set off;
(xi) The non-refund of the Entry Fee to the appellant suffers from manifest arbitrariness:
(a) The set off policy creates a separate class between similarly placed TSPs whose licences were
quashed, on the basis of whether or not a bidder or entity has chosen to participate in the fresh
auction; and
(b) A business entity may have valid reasons not to participate in the fresh auction, for which it
cannot be penalized;
(xii) The appellant ought not to be punished for the wrongdoing of the respondent:
(a) In the judgment in CPIL (supra), this Court held that the ―First Come First
Serve(cid:130) policy of the Union government for the grant of telecom licenses was flawed,
arbitrary and illegal;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 7Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
PART B
(b) This Court further imposed costs of Rs 5 crores upon those licence holders before it who had
benefitted at the cost of the public exchequer and had offloaded their stakes for thousands of crores
in name of fresh infusion of or transfer of equity. On the other hand, costs of only Rs 50 lakhs were
imposed on those licence holders (including the appellant) who had allegedly benefited by the
wholly arbitrary and unconstitutional action of the Department of Telecommunication13 for the
grant of UASLs and the allocation of the 2G spectrum band. Hence, no role was attributed to the
appellant for quashing of its licenses;
(c) In any event, the appellant has been acquitted of criminal charges on 21 December 2017 by the
Special Judge, CBI;
(d) Even otherwise, the pendency of criminal proceedings is not an impediment to proceed with civil
proceedings; and
(e) The respondent has already auctioned spectrum which was allocated earlier to the appellant for
Rs 10,400 crores and has thus benefited twice from the same spectrum. The respondent cannot be
allowed to unjustly enrich itself by usurping the Entry Fee paid by the appellant. The principles
underlying the doctrine of unjust enrichment are duly fulfilled in the present case;
―DoT(cid:130) PART B
(xiii) The provisions of the Indian Contract Act would be applicable to the claim of the appellant:
(a) TDSAT has wrongly held that the licences were quashed by this Court in the exercise of its
constitutional powers, thereby ousting the provisions of the Indian Contract Act;
(b) The licence granted under the proviso to Section 4(1) of the Indian Telegraph Act 1885 is in the
nature of a contract between the Government and its licensees. This proposition finds support in the
judgment of this Court in Union of India v. AUSPI15;
(c) Once the contracts were held to be void and were quashed in CPIL (supra), the consequences
which are envisaged in the Indian Contract Act must follow. When a contract is discovered to be
void, the benefit/advantage received by one party under the contract ought to be returned to the
other party;
(d) The appellant, when it entered into the contract with the respondent, had no knowledge of the
fact that the ―First Come First Serve(cid:130) policy of the Union government would be quashed by this
Court. The Union government defended its policy before this Court, and thus ought to be directed to
refund the Entry Fee;
―Telegraph Act(cid:130) (2011) 10 SCC 534 (―AUSPI(cid:130)) PART B
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 8Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
(e) In the absence of any legislative intervention precluding the grant of the refund, the rights of the
parties would be governed by the law of contract. Thus, the doctrine of frustration under Section 56
and the principle of restitution under Section 65 of the Indian Contract Act would stand attracted in
the present case;
(f) Judicial orders are declaratory and retrospective in nature. The judgment in CPIL (supra) relates
back to the validity of the licences. The appellant had only six thousand subscribers before the
licences were quashed and was in the phase of rolling out and investing capital as a result of which it
did not acquire any substantial benefit;
(g) Since the licences were provided on a representation that they would have a tenure of twenty
years but were declared to be void within four years due to the flawed policy of the Union
Government, the appellant will be entitled to refund of the Entry Fee with interest; and
(h) The respondent is estopped from relying upon the UASL Guidelines and UASL agreements,
which provide that the Entry Fee is non-refundable. This is because the licences were not quashed
either due to a default on part of the appellant or its withdrawal, but due to the policy of the Union
government being found to be illegal and arbitrary; and PART B
(xiv) The decisions16 of this Court in the relation to the payment of Adjusted Gross Revenue17 have
no relevance to the present case.
9 Opposing the submissions which have been urged on behalf of the appellant, Mr Vikramjit
Banerjee, learned Additional Solicitor General, appearing on behalf of the Union of India has urged
the following submissions:
(i) The Entry Fee paid by the appellant is specifically made non-refundable by the UASL Guidelines
which were issued by the DoT on 14 December 2005. Once the Letters of Intent were issued to the
appellant for twenty-one service areas, the appellant deposited the Entry Fee for each circle in
accordance with the UASL Guidelines on 10 January 2008. The appellant became eligible for the
issuance of UASLs for each of the twenty-one service areas only thereafter. The UASL agreements
which were entered into between the Union Government and the appellant on 4 March 2008
expressly contemplated that the Entry Fee was a one-time non-refundable fee. The Entry Fee being
non- refundable in nature, the appellant cannot now seek a refund;
(ii) The issues which are sought to be raised in the present civil appeals are squarely governed by the
judgment in CPIL (supra). The judgment of this Court examined the validity of the licences and
spectrum allocation made to the licensees including the appellant. The judgment in CPIL (supra)
found that Union of India v. Association of Unified Telecom Service Providers of India and Ors.,
(2020) 3 SCC 525; and Union of India v. Association of Unified Telecom Service Providers of India
and Ors., Civil Appeal Nos 6328- 6399 of 2015 ―AGR(cid:130) PART B the licensees had unfairly gained
access to the then Minister in-charge as well as certain officers of the DoT in order to gain
preferences. This Court found that the grant of licences was ―stage-managed(cid:130) to favour specific
licensees, including the appellant, as a result of which costs of Rs 50 lakhs were also imposed on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 9Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
them;
(iii) While quashing the grant of the licences, the judgment in CPIL (supra) did not grant any refund
of the Entry Fee. The claim for restitution not having been allowed by this Court in CPIL (supra), the
appellant cannot seek to do so at this stage;
(iv) After the judgment in CPIL (supra) quashing the UASLs granted to the appellant, the appellant
has ceased to be a licensee for the purposes of Section 14(1)(a) of the TRAI Act, which empowers the
TDSAT to adjudicate disputes between a licensor and a licensee. The TDSAT did not have
jurisdiction under the provisions of Section 14(1)(a). In any event, the TDSAT by its judgment dated
16 September 2015 rejected the appellant’s claim for refund on the ground that it was incompetent
to do so, the licences having been quashed by the judgment of this Court. Having moved this Court
in the first set of civil appeals, the appellant withdrew the civil appeals on 13 May 2016, though with
liberty to move this Court again, if it became so necessary. Thus, in view of the order dated 13 May
2016, the appellant could have only moved this Court and not TDSAT. However, it instituted a
Second Telecom Petition before the TDSAT. The TDSAT by its judgment dated 11 December PART B
2018 rejected the second attempt of the appellant for claiming the same relief, since this would
essentially amount to a review of the judgment in CPIL (supra). Thus, moving the Second Telecom
Petition was not only contrary to Section 14 of the TRAI Act but also in violation of the text and
spirit of the order dated 13 May 2016 of this Court;
(v) The decision of the EGoM dated 31 October 2012 granting set off to those bidders who had
participated and were found to be successful in the fresh round of auctions was a one-time
concession offered to TSPs whose licences were quashed earlier, in order to ensure that telecom
services were provided to consumers in an uninterrupted manner. The decision in CPIL (supra) did
not bar licensees from participating in the subsequent auction. Since the Entry Fees paid by
licensees covered by the judgment in CPIL (supra) could not have been refunded, the EGoM decided
to adjust their Entry Fee in the subsequent auction in the event that they were declared successful. It
was believed that this would encourage the participation of all TSPs in the subsequent auction and
increase the prospects of a higher price discovery, thereby ultimately benefitting the public
exchequer. This set off policy was uniformly applied to all licensees covered by the judgment in CPIL
(supra), including the appellant, and thus is not discriminatory. No TSP covered by the decision in
CPIL (supra) was compelled to participate in the subsequent auction being conducted by the DoT by
the virtue of the set off policy. Rather, the policy only sought to increase participation in the
subsequent auction by PART B offering a concession in the form of set off of the previously paid
Entry Fee, in case they emerged successful in the fresh auction. Being a policy decision involving
industry specific issues, this Court should be circumspect in interfering with this decision of the
Union government;
(vi) The acquittal of the promoters of the appellant in the criminal case has no bearing on the refund
of the Entry Fee. The judgment of the Special Judge, CBI acquitting the promoters of the appellant
was only concerned with the alleged violation of Clause 8 of the UASL Guidelines issued by DoT.
The acquittal has no bearing on the findings of this Court in CPIL (supra), according to which UASL
and allocation of spectrum was held to be ―stage managed(cid:130) and violative of the principles of public
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 10Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
law. This precludes the appellant from claiming any refund or restitution; and
(vii) As a matter of fact, the judgment of this Court in CPIL (supra) has imposed costs of Rs 50 lakhs
on the appellant for wrongly benefitting from the wholly arbitrary and unconstitutional exercise of
licence and spectrum allocation. Consequently, even under the contract law, the appellant is
disentitled from claiming any refund or restitution of the Entry Fee based on the principle of in pari
delicto.
10 In the submissions made in the rejoinder, both Dr A M Singhvi and Mr Huzefa A Ahmadi,
learned Senior Counsel, have submitted that the judgment in CPIL (supra) does not expressly or
impliedly bar the refund of Entry Fee. As a matter of fact, the TDSAT held that the decision of this
Court was not conclusive in ruling out PART B a refund. The judgment in CPIL (supra) was reserved
on 17 March 2011 and was delivered on 2 February 2012, and the quashing of the licences could not
have been contemplated by any of the litigants. Theoretically, even if the claim for restitution could
have been made before this Court at that stage, the appellant is not precluded from raising the claim
before this Court in the present proceedings. Further, Sections 14 and 15 of the TRAI Act confer a
plenary remedy before the TDSAT. Hence, the appellant moved the TDSAT within a few weeks of
the judgment in CPIL (supra). It was urged that for the principles of constructive res judicata to
apply , the bar must be clearly evident. In a Public Interest Litigation petition, it would not be
appropriate to apply the principles of constructive res judicata against the respondent (the appellant
herein) save in an exceptional case. Elaborating on the above submissions, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi
urged that:
(i) The right to claim restitution would arise only after the licences were quashed by this Court and
hence, the decision in CPIL (supra) does not operate as constructive res judicata;
(ii) The relief sought before this Court in the public interest petition under Article 32 of the
Constitution which led to the decision in CPIL (supra) was the setting aside of the auction and
damages. This Court did not grant damages per se while it imposed costs on the licensees. Hence, in
terms of Section 11 of the Civil Procedure Code 1908, the prayer for damages must be deemed to
have been refused; and PART C
(iii) The ultimate direction in CPIL (supra) was that its observations would not apply to other
proceedings and hence, there was no intent to foreclose other rights under the law.
In view of these premises, it has been urged that the petition under Article 32 which led to the
decision in CPIL (supra) did not seek the forfeiture of the Entry fee and hence, the principles of
constructive res judicata would find no application at all. This Court having imposed costs of Rs 5
crores on one set of licensees and Rs 50 lakhs on another group of licensees (which included the
appellant), it would be wholly disproportionate to forfeit an amount of Rs 1454.94 crores in the
absence of an implied forfeiture in terms of the earlier decision of this Court.
11 The rival submissions will now be analysed.

C The CPIL judgment
12 The decision of this Court, which was rendered on 2 February 2012, arose
from petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution. The petitions questioned the grant of UASLs to
the private respondents in those proceedings (which included the appellant), on the ground that the
procedure which was adopted by DoT was arbitrary, illegal and in violation of Article 14 of the
Constitution. Among the grounds of challenge, it was urged that:
PART C
(i) Since the cut-off of 25 September 2007 fixed for considering the applications had been held to be
arbitrary by the Delhi High Court (which was approved by this Court), the procedure adopted by
DoT with the approval of the Minister for Communications and Information Technology was liable
to be declared as arbitrary and illegal;
(ii) The DoT had violated the recommendations made by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India 18
that there should be no cap on the number of access service providers in any service area;
(iii) As noted in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the consideration of a large
number of ineligible applications and the grant of licences to them was illegal and arbitrary;
(iv) The method adopted by DoT for grant of licences was flawed because it was based upon the
recommendations made by TRAI, which were arbitrary and contrary to public interest, since they
recommended the granting of licences at the entry fees which were determined in 2001;
(v) While granting licences which were bundled with the spectrum at a price which was fixed in
2001, the DoT did not consult the Finance Ministry and violated the decision taken by the Council of
Ministers in 2003;
(vi) The ―First Come First Serve(cid:130) policy violated Article 14, and its distortion by the then Minister of
Communications and Information Technology and the consequent grant of licences was liable to be
annulled; and ―TRAI(cid:130) PART C
(vii) The Union government did not take any action to cancel the licences of a number of licensees
who had failed to fulfil the roll-out obligations and violated the conditions of the licences.
13 While dealing with the grounds of challenge, in the course of the judgment, this Court
underscored that natural resources, such as spectrum, are public goods and the doctrine of equality
and public trust must guide the State in determining the actual mechanism for their distribution.
After analysing the rationale adopted by TRAI for recommending the allocation of the 2G spectrum
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 12Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
on the basis of 2001 prices, this Court held:
―91. To say the least, the entire approach adopted by TRAI was lopsided and contrary
to the decision taken by the Council of Ministers and its recommendations became a
handle for the then Minister of Communications and Information Technology and
the officers of DoT who virtually gifted away the important national asset at
throw-away prices by wilfully ignoring the concerns raised from various quarters
including the Prime Minister, Ministry of Finance and also some of its own officers.
This becomes clear from the fact that soon after obtaining the licences, some of the
beneficiaries offloaded their stakes to others in the name of transfer of equity or
infusion of fresh capital by foreign companies, and thereby made huge profits. We
have no doubt that if the method of auction had been adopted for grant of licence
which could be the only rational transparent method for distribution of national
wealth, the nation would have been enriched by many thousand crores.(cid:130) 14 This
Court found a basic flaw in the ―First Come First Serve(cid:130) policy, holding:
―94. There is a fundamental flaw in the first-come-first-served policy inasmuch as it
involves an element of pure chance or accident. In matters involving award of
contracts or grant of licence or permission to use public property, the invocation of
PART C first-come-first-served policy has inherently dangerous implications. Any
person who has access to the power corridor at the highest or the lowest level may be
able to obtain information from the government files or the files of the
agency/instrumentality of the State that a particular public property or asset is likely
to be disposed of or a contract is likely to be awarded or a licence or permission is
likely to be given, he would immediately make an application and would become
entitled to stand first in the queue at the cost of all others who may have a better
claim.(cid:130) 15 This Court held that an auction conducted after due publicity was perhaps
the best method for fulfilling the constitutional requirement of preserving equity in
the alienation of natural resources. In the absence of such a mechanism, this Court
held that alienation of natural resources/public property is likely to be misused by
unscrupulous people who are only interested in garnering maximum financial benefit
and have no respect for constitutional ethos and values.
16 In the course of its decision, this Court held, in no uncertain terms, that the then
Minister for Communications and Information Technology had acted to favour some
companies at the cost of the public exchequer:
“97. The exercise undertaken by the officers of DoT between September 2007 and
March 2008, under the leadership of the then Minister of Communications and
Information Technology was wholly arbitrary, capricious and contrary to public
interest apart from being violative of the doctrine of equality. The material produced
before the Court shows that the Minister of Communications and Information
Technology wanted to favour some companies at the cost of the public exchequer and
for this purpose, he took the following steps:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 13Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
(i) Soon after his appointment as Minister of Communications and Information
Technology, he directed that all the applications received for grant of UAS licence
should be kept pending till the receipt of the TRAI recommendations.
PART C
(ii) The recommendations made by TRAI on 28-8-2007 were not placed before the
full Telecom Commission which, among others, would have included the Finance
Secretary. The notice of the meeting of the Telecom Commission was not given to any
of the non-permanent members despite the fact that the recommendations made by
TRAI for allocation of spectrum in 2G bands had serious financial implications. This
has been established from the pleadings and the records produced before this Court
which show that after issuance of licences, 3 applicants transferred their equities for a
total sum of Rs 24,493 crores in favour of foreign companies.
Therefore, it was absolutely necessary for DoT to take the opinion of the Finance Ministry as per the
requirement of the Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961.
(iii) The officers of DoT who attended the meeting of the Telecom Commission held on 10-10-2007
hardly had any choice but to approve the recommendations made by TRAI. If they had not done so,
they would have incurred the wrath of the Minister of Communications and Information
Technology.
(iv) In view of the approval by the Council of Ministers of the recommendations made by the Group
of Ministers in 2003, DoT had to discuss the issue of spectrum pricing with the Ministry of Finance.
Therefore, DoT was under an obligation to involve the Ministry of Finance before any decision could
be taken in the context of Paras 2.78 and 2.79 of the TRAI's recommendations. However, as the
Minister of Communications and Information Technology was very much conscious of the fact that
the Secretary, Finance, had objected to the allocation of 2G Spectrum at the rates fixed in 2001, he
did not consult the Finance Minister or the officers of the Finance Ministry.
(v) The Minister of Communications and Information Technology brushed aside the suggestion
made by the Minister of Law and Justice for placing the matter before the Empowered Group of
Ministers. Not only this, within few hours of the receipt of the suggestion made by the Prime
Minister in his letter dated 2-11-2007 that keeping in view the inadequacy of spectrum,
transparency and fairness should be maintained in the matter of allocation thereof, the Minister of
Communications and Information Technology rejected the same by saying that it will be unfair,
discriminatory, arbitrary and capricious to auction the spectrum to new applicants because it will
not give them level playing field.
PART C
(vi) The Minister of Communications and Information Technology introduced the cut-off date as
25-9-2007 for consideration of the applications received for grant of licence despite the fact that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 14Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
only one day prior to this, a press release was issued by DoT fixing 1-10-2007 as the last date for
receipt of the applications. This arbitrary action of the Minister of Communications and Information
Technology though appears to be innocuous, actually benefited some of the real estate companies
who did not have any experience in dealing with telecom services and who had made applications
only on 24-9-2007 i.e. one day before the cut-off date fixed by the Minister of Communications and
Information Technology on his own.
(vii) The cut-off date i.e. 25-9-2007 decided by the Minister of Communications and Information
Technology on 2-11-2007 was not made public till 10-1-2008 and the first-come-first- served policy,
which was being followed since 2003 was changed by him on 7-1-2008 and was incorporated in
press release dated 10-1-2008. This enabled some of the applicants, who had access either to the
Minister or the officers of DoT to get the demand drafts, bank guarantee, etc. prepared in advance
for compliance with conditions of the LoIs, which was the basis for determination of seniority for
grant of licences and allocation of spectrum.
(viii) The meeting of the full Telecom Commission, which was scheduled to be held on 9-1-2008 to
consider issues relating to grant of licences and pricing of spectrum was deliberately postponed on
7-1-2008 so that the Secretary, Finance and Secretaries of three other important Departments may
not be able to raise objections against the procedure devised by DoT for grant of licence and
allocation of spectrum by applying the principle of level playing field.
(ix) The manner in which the exercise for grant of the LoIs to the applicants was conducted on
10-1-2008 leaves no room for doubt that everything was stage-managed to favour those who were
able to know in advance the change in the implementation of the first-come-first-served policy. As a
result of this, some of the companies which had submitted applications in 2004 or 2006 were
pushed down in the priority and those who had applied between August and September 2007
succeeded in getting higher seniority entitling them to allocation of spectrum on priority basis.(cid:130)
PART C This is a clear indicator of the complicity between the Minister and the business entities he
was acting to favour on the basis of the ―First Come First Serve(cid:130) policy. 17 This Court found that
―everything was stage-managed to favour those who were able to know in advance the change in the
implementation of the first-come- first served policy(cid:130). It was in the backdrop of the above finding,
that this Court issued the following directions:
―102. In the result, the writ petitions are allowed in the following terms:
(i) The licences granted to the private respondents on or after 10-1-2008 pursuant to
two press releases issued on 10-1- 2008 and subsequent allocation of spectrum to the
licensees are declared illegal and are quashed.
(ii) The above direction shall become operative after four months.
(iii) Keeping in view the decision taken by the Central Government in 2011, TRAI
shall make fresh recommendations for grant of licence and allocation of spectrum in
2G band in 22 service areas by auction, as was done for allocation of spectrum in 3G
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 15Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
band.
(iv) The Central Government shall consider the recommendations of TRAI and take
appropriate decision within next one month and fresh licences be granted by auction.
(v) Respondents 2, 3 and 9 who have been benefited at the cost of public exchequer by a wholly
arbitrary and unconstitutional action taken by DoT for grant of UAS licences and allocation of
spectrum in 2G band and who offloaded their stakes for many thousand crores in the name of fresh
infusion of equity or transfer of equity shall pay costs of Rs 5 crores each. Respondents 4, 6, 7 and 10
shall pay costs of Rs 50 lakhs each because they too had been benefited by the wholly arbitrary and
unconstitutional exercise undertaken by DoT for grant of UAS licences and allocation of spectrum in
2G band. We have not imposed costs on the PART C respondents who had submitted their
applications in 2004 and 2006 and whose applications were kept pending till 2007.
(vi) Within four months, 50% of the costs shall be deposited with the Supreme Court Legal Services
Committee for being used for providing legal aid to poor and indigent litigants. The remaining 50%
costs shall be deposited in the funds created for Resettlement and Welfare Schemes of the Ministry
of Defence.
(vii) However, it is made clear that the observations made in this judgment shall not, in any manner,
affect the pending investigation by CBI, Directorate of Enforcement and other agencies or cause
prejudice to those who are facing prosecution in the cases registered by CBI or who may face
prosecution on the basis of charge-sheet(s) which may be filed by CBI in future and the Special
Judge, CBI shall decide the matter uninfluenced by this judgment. We also make it clear that this
judgment shall not prejudice any person in the action which may be taken by other investigating
agencies under the Income Tax Act, 1961, the Prevention of Money- Laundering Act, 2002 and other
similar statutes.(cid:130) 18 Reading the judgment of this Court in CPIL (supra), it is impossible to accept
the submission which has been urged on behalf of the appellant that the fraud in the ―First Come
First Serve(cid:130) policy lay at the doorstep of the Union government alone and that the appellant was
free from taint or wrong doing. The decision of this Court held that the ―First Come First Serve(cid:130)
policy was writ large with arbitrariness, and was intended to favour certain specific entities at a
grave detriment to the public exchequer. Undoubtedly, the authors of the ―First Come First Serve(cid:130)
policy were the official actors comprised within the Union government. But equally, the decision did
not exculpate the private business entities who obtained UASLs and became the beneficiaries of
their decision. The decision of this Court concludes in no uncertain terms that the then Minister of
Communications and Information Technology wanted PART C to favour some companies at the cost
of the public exchequer, and that as a matter of fact the entire process was ―stage-managed(cid:130) to
favour those who had access to the nitty-gritties of the policy in advance. As a result, the Court
found that companies which had submitted applications in 2004 or 2006 were side-lined by
favouring those who had applied between August and September 2007 and who ―succeeded in
getting higher seniority entitling them to allocation of spectrum on priority basis(cid:130). 19 In the
concluding part, the judgment in CPIL (supra) imposed costs of Rs 5 crores each on three licensees
on the ground that they had benefited at the cost of the public exchequer by a ―wholly arbitrary and
unconstitutional action(cid:130) taken by DoT for the grant of licences and allocation of spectrum, and who
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 16Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
had subsequently offloaded their stakes for many thousand crores in the name of fresh infusion or
transfer of equity. On the other hand, the appellant was amongst the four licensees who were
directed to pay a cost of Rs 50 lakhs each ―because they too had been benefited by the wholly
arbitrary and unconstitutional exercise undertaken by DoT for grant of UASL and allocation of
spectrum of 2G band(cid:130). 20 The beneficiaries of the patently unconstitutional mechanism deployed
for the allocation of spectrum were corporate entities who were favoured under the ―First Come
First Serve(cid:130) policy. The appellant is one of them. The distinction made by the judgment of this
Court between the three licensees who were subjected to costs of Rs 5 crores and four licensees,
including the appellant, who were subject to costs of Rs 50 lakhs was because in the case of a former
their stakes had been offloaded ostensibly in the name of a fresh infusion or transfer of equity.
However, it is evident PART D that all these licensees were complicit in the illegal exercise of
obtaining favours for themselves by the indulgence of those in power. That, above all, was the
foundation of the decision in CPIL (supra) and the justification for quashing licences and the
allocation of the 2G spectrum. This Court then directed the TRAI to frame fresh recommendations
for the grant of licences and for the allocation of spectrum in the 2G band in twenty-two service
areas by auction, as was done for the allocation of spectrum in the 3G band. Thus, the decision in
CPIL (supra) leaves no manner of doubt that the appellant was in pari delicto along with the Union
government.
D The claim for refund of Entry Fee
21 The nature of the Entry Fee has to be understood from the UASL Guidelines
which were issued by the DoT on 14 December 2005. Clause 619 of the Guidelines required each
applicant seeking a UASL for a given service area to deposit a ―non- refundable entry fee(cid:130) in
accordance with Annexure 1, which elucidated the quantum of the fee which was payable for
different service areas. Clause 1420 indicates that the Entry Fee was payable in addition to the
annual licence fee which was payable for holding a UASL.
―6 The detail of non-refundable Entry fee, Category of service area, Financial bank guarantee,
performance bank guarantee, Net worth and Paid up equity capital required under the Unified
Access Services Licence for each service area is as per Annexure-I. The prescribed paid-up equity
capital shall be maintained during currency of the licence.(cid:130) ―14 In addition to the non refundable
Entry fee described above, the Licensee shall also pay Licence fee annually @ 10/8/6% of Adjusted
Gross Revenue (AGR) for category A/B/C service areas respectively excluding spectrum charges.(cid:130)
PART D 22 Letters of Intent were issued to the appellant for providing unified access service to
twenty-one service areas. The appellant deposited the circle wise Entry Fee, in terms of the UASL
Guidelines, on 10 January 2008 in the amount of Rs 1454.94 crores. It is only upon the payment of
this Entry Fee that the appellant became eligible to be issued UASLs in the twenty-one service areas.
Clause 18.121 of the UASL agreement acknowledged the payment of a ―onetime non-refundable
entry fee(cid:130) prior to the signing of the agreement. Thus, the Entry Fee was a onetime non-refundable
fee payable. According to the Union government, this was payable by an applicant for participating
in the process of obtaining the UASL and was distinguishable from the licence fee under Clause
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 17Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
10.122, which was relatable to the actual operation of the licence.
23 In the course of its judgment dated 16 September 2015, the TDSAT dealt with the submission of
the Union of India that the Entry Fee was ―non-refundable(cid:130) in terms of the UASL Guidelines.
Dealing with the submission, the TDSAT observed:
―To us it appears that submissions based on section 4 of the Telegraph Act or the
characterisation of the entry fee in the UASL guidelines and the licence as
―non-refundable(cid:130) is really ―18.1 Entry Fee:
One Time non-refundable Entry Fee of Rs .1.1 Crore has been paid by the LICENSEE prior to
signing of this Licence agreement.(cid:130) ―10.1 The LICENSOR reserves the right to suspend the
operation of this LICENCE in whole or in part, at any time, if, in the opinion of the LICENSOR, it is
necessary or expedient to do so in public interest or in the interest of the security of the State or for
the proper conduct of the TELEGRAPH. Licence Fee payable to the LICENSOR will not be required
to be paid for the period for which the operation of this LICENCE remains suspended in whole. If
situation so warrant, it shall not be necessary for Licensor to issue a notice for seeking comments of
the LICENSEE for this purpose and the decision of the Licensor shall be final and binding. Provided
that the LICENSOR shall not be responsible for any damage or loss caused or arisen out, of
aforesaid action. Provided further that the suspension of the licence will not be a cause or ground for
extension of the period of the LICENCE and suspension period will be taken as period spent.(cid:130) PART
D begging the question. The submissions would have carried weight if the petitioners’ licences were
cancelled or terminated for any violation of the term of the licences or were surrendered by it by its
own accord. In the facts of the present case the petitioner failed to get entry into…the exclusive
domain reserved by law for the State...(cid:130) 24 There is much to commend in the above line of
reasoning of the TDSAT. The Entry Fee, under the terms of the UASL Guidelines and the UASL
agreements, was a one-time non-refundable fee. The TDSAT held that the submission of the Union
of India would have credence if the licences were terminated for breach or if the licensee were to
voluntarily surrender the licence. However, this was a case where the licence was held to be
unlawful, due to its grant being in breach of the constitutional mandate under Article 14. All the
licences and the allocation of spectrum came to be cancelled by the decision in CPIL (supra) on the
ground that the policy and the process followed by the Union government were arbitrary, and
unjustified benefits had been granted to the licensees. Thus, the TDSAT held that, strictly speaking,
the contractual term stipulating that the Entry Fee was non- refundable would not by and in itself
preclude the claim for refund on the basis of the judgment of this Court in CPIL (supra), which held
that the entire process leading up to the award of the licences was arbitrary and constitutional. The
TDSAT having entered the above finding, for the rest of the discussion, this judgment will also
proceed on that premise.
(cid:12) PART E
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 18Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
E Jurisdiction of TDSAT
25 The appellant has objected to TDSAT’s conclusion that the appellant’s
remedy does not fall in the contractual realm between itself and the Union of India. Since the public
law remedy of restitution was neither claimed before nor granted by this Court in CPIL (supra), the
TDSAT went into the genesis of the dispute and consequential reliefs granted by this court. . The
TDSAT held that since the challenge was focused on the arbitrary and mala fide actions that were
embodied in the policy of allotting 2G spectrum licences, the quashing of the licences was a
necessary consequence of the grant of the licences being vitiated. Thus, the TDSAT held that ―a
direction for refund [is] outside the purview of the Contract Act and an exercise of Constitutional
powers is clearly beyond the authority of this Tribunal [TDSAT] and in that regard the petitioner
must approach the Court that quashed its licenses, that is, Supreme Court and seek appropriate
reliefs(cid:130). 26 This Court will analyse whether the TDSAT had the jurisdiction to entertain the claim
for a refund of the Entry Fee. The TDSAT is an adjudicatory body constituted under the TRAI Act.
Initially, the TRAI was empowered to regulate the telecom sector in India and adjudicate upon
disputes. The adjudicatory powers of TRAI, specifically with respect to issuing directions to DoT,
were placed in issue before the Delhi High Court in Union of India v. Telecom Regulatory Authority
of PART E India23. The Delhi High Court held that TRAI did not possess the authority to issue
directions to DoT. In order to overcome the effect of this position, the TRAI Act was amended in
2000 and the TDSAT was established. TDSAT’s website24 elaborates on the Statement of Objects
and Reasons to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Amendment) Act 2000 and notes:
―In order to bring in functional clarity and strengthen the regulatory framework and
the disputes settlement mechanism in the telecommunication sector, the TRAI Act of
1997 was amended in the year 2000 and TDSAT was set up to adjudicate disputes
and dispose of appeals with a view to protect the interests of service providers and
consumers of the telecom sector and to promote and ensure orderly growth of the
telecom sector…(cid:130) The TRAI Act governs the functioning of the TDSAT. The
jurisdiction of civil courts has been ousted by Section 15. Section 16 enables the
TDSAT to regulate its own procedure, guided by the principles of natural justice. An
appeal on a substantial question of law lies to this Court under Section 18 of the TRAI
Act. In the above statutory context, the jurisdiction of TDSAT will be evaluated below.
27 Section 14(a) 25 of the TRAI Act empowers the TDSAT to adjudicate any dispute:

(i) Between a licensor and licensee;
(ii) Between two or more service providers; and
(iii) Between a service provider and a group of consumers.
28 The scope of the TDSAT’s powers to adjudicate ―any dispute(cid:130) was interpreted
in Cellular Operators Association of India v. Union of India26 by a three-judge Bench of this Court.
The Court held that the powers envisaged by the TRAI Act for the TDSAT are wide and it would not
be appropriate for this Court to impose limitations on them. Chief Justice G B Pattanaik noted:
―8…Chapter IV containing Section 14 was inserted by an amendment of the year
2002 and the very Statement of Objects and Reasons would indicate that to increase
the investors' confidence and to create a level playing field between the public and the
private operators, suitable amendment in the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
Act, 1997 was brought about and under the amendment, a tribunal was constituted
called the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal for adjudicating the
disputes between a licensor and a licensee, between two or more service
(i) between a licensor and a licensee;
(ii) between two or more service providers;
(iii) between a service provider and a group of consumers:
Provided that nothing in this clause shall apply in respect of matters relating to— (A) the
monopolistic trade practice, restrictive trade practice and unfair trade practice which are subject to
the jurisdiction of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission established under
sub-section (1) of Section 5 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 (54 of 1969);
(B) the complaint of an individual consumer maintainable before a Consumer Disputes Redressal
Forum or a Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission or the National Consumer Redressal
Commission established under Section 9 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (68 of 1986); (C) the
dispute between telegraph authority and any other person referred to in sub-section (1) of Section
7-B of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 (13 of 1885);..(cid:130) (2003) 3 SCC 186 PART E providers, between
a service provider and a group of consumers and also to hear and dispose of appeal against any
direction, decision or order of the Authority. The aforesaid provision was absolutely essential as the
organizations of the licensor, namely, MTNL and BSNL were also service providers. That being the
object for which an independent tribunal was constituted, the power of that Tribunal has to be
adjudged from the language conferring that power and it would not be appropriate to restrict the
same on the ground that the decision which is the subject-matter of challenge before the Tribunal
was that of an expert body.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 20Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
[…] Having regard to the very purpose and object for which the Appellate Tribunal was constituted
and having examined the different provisions contained in Chapter IV, more particularly, the
provision dealing with ousting the jurisdiction of the civil court in relation to any matter which the
Appellate Tribunal is empowered by or under the Act, as contained in Section 15, we have no
hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the power of the Appellate Tribunal is quite wide, as has
been indicated in the statute itself and the decisions of this Court dealing with the power of a court,
exercising appellate power or original power, will have no application for limiting the jurisdiction of
the Appellate Tribunal under the Act. Since the Tribunal is the original authority to adjudicate any
dispute between a licensor and a licensee or between two or more service providers or between a
service provider and a group of consumers and since the Tribunal has to hear and dispose of appeals
against the directions, decisions or order of TRAI, it is difficult for us to import the self-contained
restrictions and limitations of a court under the judge-made law to which reference has already been
made and reliance was placed by the learned Attorney-General…(cid:130) Justice S B Sinha, in his
concurring opinion, further elaborated on the jurisprudence surrounding tribunals constituted
under regulatory statutes. The judgment noted that the TDSAT was a creature of statute and was
empowered to determine its PART E jurisdiction, subject to the constraints stipulated in the statute.
The appeal to this Court under Section 18 has been confined to a ―substantial question of law(cid:130).
Since no such constraints have been placed on the jurisdiction of the TDSAT under Section 14, the
jurisdiction of the TDSAT was held to be broader:
―27. TDSAT was required to exercise its jurisdiction in terms of Section 14-A of the
Act. TDSAT itself is an expert body and its jurisdiction is wide having regard to
sub-section (7) of Section 14-A thereof. Its jurisdiction extends to examining the
legality, propriety or correctness of a direction/order or decision of the authority in
terms of sub-section (2) of Section 14 as also the dispute made in an application
under sub- section (1) thereof. The approach of the learned TDSAT, being on the
premise that its jurisdiction is limited or akin to the power of judicial review is,
therefore, wholly unsustainable. The extent of jurisdiction of a court or a tribunal
depends upon the relevant statute. TDSAT is a creature of a statute. Its jurisdiction is
also conferred by a statute. The purpose of creation of TDSAT has expressly been
stated by Parliament in the amending Act of 2000. TDSAT, thus, failed to take into
consideration the amplitude of its jurisdiction and thus misdirected itself in law… […]
29. If a jurisdictional question or the extent thereof is disputed before a tribunal, the
tribunal must necessarily decide it unless the statute provides otherwise. (See
Judicial Review of Administrative Law by H.W.R. Wade and C.F. Forsyth, p.
260.) Only when a question of law or a mixed question of fact and law are decided by
a tribunal, the High Court or the Supreme Court can exercise its power of judicial
review.
[…]
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 21Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
34. Statutory recommendations made by it are normally accepted by the Central
Government, as a result of which the rights and obligations of the parties may
seriously be affected. It was in the aforementioned premise Parliament thought of
creating an independent expert tribunal which, if an occasion arises therefor, may
interfere with the finding of fact, finding of law or a mixed question of law and fact of
the authority.
PART E Succinctly stated, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is not circumscribed in any manner
whatsoever…(cid:130) 29 Section 14 of the TRAI Act has also been interpreted in Union of India v. TATA
Teleservices (Maharashtra Ltd)27 by a two-judge Bench of this Court. In that case, the respondent
had moved the TDSAT seeking a declaration that the action of the Union of India (the licensor) in
raising a claim and recovering the amount was unlawful. The respondent also sought a declaration
that a set-off made by invoking a condition of the licence in respect of the Maharashtra service area
was illegal. The Union of India claimed that it was entitled to make the set-off and recover damages
occasioned by the failure of the respondent to fulfil its obligations under a letter of intent issued in
respect of the Karnataka Telecom circle. The TDSAT had rejected the claim of the Union of India
that it was entitled to a legal or equitable set off and held that it had no jurisdiction to enter a
counterclaim at the instance of the Union of India. In appeal, this Court held that either as a licensor
or a service provider, the Union government could make an application to TDSAT regarding a
dispute between it and the licensee, another service provider or a group of consumers. This Court
noted that there was no reason to whittle down the right ―of the Union government to move the
Tribunal for adjudication of its claim within the purview of Section 14(1)(cid:130). This Court observed that
if the subject matter was capable of being raised by way of a claim under Section 14 of the TRAI Act,
it would not be logical to (2007) 7 SCC 517 (―Tata Teleservices(cid:130)) PART E exclude the power to raise
a counterclaim. Having held that the TDSAT had jurisdiction to entertain a counter claim, the
judgment dealt with the submission of the respondent that where a licence had not actually been
issued to a party by the Union government, the dispute did not fall either under Clause (i) or (ii) of
Section 14(a). The Court held that:
―19…In other words, a dispute commencing with the acceptance of a tender leading
to the possible issue of a licence and disputes arising out of the grant of licence even
after the period has expired would all come within the purview of Section 14(a) of the
Act. To put it differently, Section 14 takes within its sweep disputes following the
issue of a letter of intent, pre-grant of actual licence as also disputes arising out of a
licence granted between a quondam licensee and the licensor.(cid:130) The Court observed
that though the bid submitted by the respondent had been accepted by the Union of
India and a letter of intent was issued, the contract ultimately did not come into
existence since the respondent was insisting on certain modifications and the licence
was not actually granted. The Court held:
―22. We have already indicated that a specialised tribunal has been constituted for
the purpose of dealing with specialised matters and disputes arising out of licences
granted under the Act. We therefore do not think that there is any reason to restrict
the jurisdiction of the tribunal so constituted by keeping out of its purview a person
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 22Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
whose offer has been accepted and to whom a letter of intent is issued by the
Government and who had even accepted that letter of intent.
Any breach or alleged breach of obligation arising after acceptance of the offer made
in response to a notice inviting tender, would also normally come within the purview
of a dispute that is liable to be settled by the specialised tribunal.(cid:130) PART E This Court
also held that there was no reason to restrict the expression ―licensee(cid:130) appearing in
Section 14(a)(i) to exclude a person like the respondent to whom a Letter of Intent
had been issued, when the Letter of Intent had been accepted but an attempt had
been made to negotiate certain terms before a formal contract was entered into and
work commenced. The Court held:
―23. We see no reason to restrict the expressions ―licensor(cid:130) or ―licensee(cid:130) occurring
in Section 14(a)(i) of the Act and to exclude a person like the respondent who had
been given a letter of intent regarding the Karnataka Circle, who had accepted the
letter of intent but was trying to negotiate some further terms of common interest
before a formal contract was entered into and the work was to be started. To exclude
disputes arising between the parties thereafter on the failure of the contract to go
through, does not appear to be warranted or justified considering the purpose for
which TDSAT has been established and the object sought to be achieved by the
creation of a specialised tribunal.(cid:130) (emphasis supplied) 30 Relying upon the
judgment in Tata Teleservices (supra), the appellant claims that the refund of the
Entry Fee falls within the purview of Section 14(a)(i) of the TRAI Act. While
evaluating the submissions, it must be noted at the outset, that there is an
inconsistency in the line of submissions urged on behalf of the appellant.
The Union of India submitted that the Entry Fee which was paid by the appellant was
a one-time non-refundable fee in terms of the UASL Guidelines and the UASL
agreement. The response of the appellant to the above submission is that the licence
was not terminated for a breach on the part of the appellant, nor did the appellant
voluntarily surrender the licence. Hence, according to the appellant, the PART E
clause in the guidelines and the agreement precluding refund would not stand
attracted. In other words, as a result of the decision of this Court in CPIL (supra), the
entire process leading up to the award of licence for 2G spectrum was held to be
vitiated and the licences were quashed. The TDSAT has accepted this line of
submission of the appellant and held that the UASL condition in regard to the non-
refundability of the one-time Entry Fee would not per se stand attracted where the licence was not
terminated for a breach but was quashed by this Court by the exercise of its jurisdiction under
Article 32 for the reason that the entire process was found to be vitiated and manifestly arbitrary.
The basis of the claim which has been raised by the appellant for refund is not a dispute over the
terms which govern the relationship between the parties following the issuance of a Letter of Intent
but before the grant of an actual licence, or a dispute arising out of a licence granted between the
licensor or a licensee. As a matter of fact, it is also important to note that the appellant, as will be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 23Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
analyzed in greater detail later, has placed reliance on the doctrine that an agreement which is void
cannot be split up and none of the parties to the agreement can be permitted to seek
part-enforcement of a contract through a court of law. In support of this proposition, reliance has
been placed on the decision of this Court in Tarsem Singh v. Sukhminder Singh28. A two-judge
Bench of this Court had held that if an agreement is held to be void, then none of the terms, ―except
in certain known exceptions, specially where the clause is treated to 1998 (3) SCC 471 (―Tarsem
Singh(cid:130)) PART E constitute separate and independent agreement, severable from the main
agreement(cid:130) can be enforced separately and independently. 31 The reliance on the principle
embodied in Tarsem Singh (supra) is a clear indicator that the basis of the claim of the refund does
not emanate from the relationship between the appellant and the respondent as licensor and
licensee. The claim for restitution is based independently on the ground that upon the decision of
this Court in CPIL (supra) holding the licence to be unlawful, the appellant is entitled to restoration
of the benefit which has been obtained by the Union of India under an agreement which is held to be
void.
32 Apart from what has been stated above, the earlier analysis of the decision in CPIL (supra)
indicates that when the controversy over the allocation of 2G spectrum and the licences was the
subject matter of adjudication before this Court, the appellant as well as the Union government were
defending the allocation of the spectrum and the grant of 2G licences. The appellant was on notice of
the fact that the award of licences in pursuance of the ―First Come First Serve(cid:130) policy was under
challenge and the main relief which was sought in the proceedings under Article 32 was for the
setting aside of the auction and the award of damages. It is in this backdrop, that the conduct of the
appellant assumes significance. The appellant did not, in the course of the adjudication before this
Court, put forth the plea for refund of the Entry Fee in the event that the allocation of the spectrum
or the grant of licences were to stand vitiated.
PART E 33 This Court has noticed a rising trend of cases where parties have attempted to take
another bite at the cherry by initiating proceedings over various forums, particularly to circumvent
the jurisdiction of this Court which is in seisin of the matter. A purportedly ancillary remedy is urged
in another forum as a dilatory tactic or as an attempt at forum shopping. One of us (Dr Justice D Y
Chandrachud), speaking for a two-judge Bench of this Court in Vedanta Ltd. v. The Goa Foundation
& Ors.29 had disapproved of such tactics. In that case, the Court dismissed a review petition against
the decision in Goa Foundation v. Sesa Sterlite Limited & Ors.30 which had analysed a party’s
attempt to pursue litigation before the High Court in spite of a conclusive decision of this Court
which had quashed its mining leases and directed issuances of fresh leases with fresh environmental
clearances in the State of Goa. In T P Moideen Koya v. Government of Kerala 31, a three-judge
Bench of this Court disapproved of the practice of vexatious litigation when the effect of a binding
judgement is sought to be diluted or altered in a manner that deviates from the procedure for
modification. The Court noted:
―13. It is well settled that a decision pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction
is binding between the parties unless it is modified or reversed by adopting a
procedure prescribed by law. It is in the interest of the public at large that finality
should attach to the binding decisions pronounced by a court of competent
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 24Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
jurisdiction and it is also in the public interest that individuals should not be vexed
twice over with the same kind of litigation. While hearing a petition under Article 32
it is not permissible for this Court either to exercise a power of Review Petition (Civil)
Diary No. 18447 of 2020 (9 July 2021) (2018) 4 SCC 218 (2004) 8 SCC 106 PART E
review or some kind of an appellate jurisdiction over a decision rendered in a matter
which has come to this Court by way of a petition under Article 136 of the
Constitution. The view taken in Bhagubhai Dullabhbhai Bhandari v. District
Magistrate [AIR 1956 SC 585 : 1956 SCR 533 : 1956 Cri LJ 1126] that the binding
nature of the conviction recorded by the High Court against which a special leave
petition was filed and was dismissed cannot be assailed in proceedings taken under
Article 32 of the Constitution was approved in Daryao v. State of U.P. [AIR 1961 SC
1457 : (1962) 1 SCR 574] (see para 14 of the Report).(cid:130) 34 The judgment in CPIL
(supra) contains a detailed enumeration of the facts which were brought to the
attention of the Court and all the submissions which were placed on the record by the
contesting parties. The submissions bear expressly on the lack of transparency and
the effort on the part of the authorities of the Union government to benefit a select
group of persons/entities who were favoured under the ―First Come First Serve(cid:130)
policy. The decision dwelt on the benefits which the selected entities have received —
both in terms of excluding others as well as in setting down the financial terms for the
award of the licence. The determination of the Entry Fee was an integral element of
the financial terms governing the award of the licence and was not a stand-alone
feature which could be isolated from the overall process leading up to the award of
licences. Therefore, the submission of the appellant that the right to appeal for a
refund of the Entry Fee would enure after the decision in CPIL (supra) would be a
simplistic understanding of the process and the ultimate decision of this Court. While
directing the cancellation of the licences and ordering a fresh auction, this Court
imposed costs of Rs 5 crores on one set of licensees and Rs 50 lakhs on another set,
after assessing their culpability in wrongly PART E benefitting from the ―wholly
arbitrary(cid:130) and ―unconstitutional exercise(cid:130) of license and spectrum allocation. It
would be an improper reading of the judgment to postulate that the decision leaves
open a claim for the refund of the Entry Fee. The payment of the Entry Fee was one
element in the overall financial conspectus which led to the award of licences. The
adjudication before this Court in CPIL (supra) must be construed as a one composite
whole from which its parts cannot be separated.
35 The appellant has argued that if the TDSAT’s conclusion on the jurisdiction were to be accepted,
it would impinge on the expanse of its jurisdiction and will exclude certain disputes falling within
the ambit of public law. However, this argument is not a correct reading of the conclusion that
TDSAT has arrived at. De hors the decision in CPIL (supra), the appellant’s dispute over the terms of
the license with the Union of India (licensor) would fall within the jurisdiction of the TDSAT under
Section 14(a)(i), as affirmed by this Court in Tata Teleservices (supra). The respondent’s argument
that the appellant is no longer a ―licensor(cid:130) after the quashing of the licenses would be a restrictive
reading of the jurisdiction of the TDSAT in view of the decision in Tata Teleservices (supra).
However, since the policy on the allocation of spectrum and the licences were quashed on the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 25Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
grounds of mala fides and arbitrariness in the Union government’s policy, the subsequent enquiry
into viability of the refund of the Entry Fee would have to be agitated before the same Court.
36 Such practice has been previously followed by the TDSAT. In AUSPI (supra), a two-judge Bench
of this Court considered the decision of the TDSAT on the PART E definition of AGR which was
upheld by this Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction under Section 18 of the TRAI Act.
This Court was called upon to decide whether a substantially similar question can be reagitated
before the TDSAT after this Court’s dismissal of the civil appeal against the TDSAT order holding
that AGR will include only revenue arising from licensed activities and not revenue from activities
outside the licence of the licensee. The Court observed that the TDSAT had jurisdiction, only after
specifically noting the order of this Court granting the Union of India specific liberty to allege the
issues before the TDSAT. This Court noted:
―32. The first substantial question of law which we have to decide is whether after
dismissal of Civil Appeal No. 84 of 2007 of the Union of India by this Court on
19-1-2007 [Union of India v. Assn. of Unified Telecom Service Providers of India,
Civil Appeal No. 84 of 2007 decided on 19-1-2007 (SC)] against the order dated
7-7-2006 of the Tribunal, the Union of India can reagitate the question decided in the
order dated 7-7-2006 that the adjusted gross revenue will include only revenue
arising from licensed activities and not revenue from activities outside the licence of
the licensee.
33. For deciding this question, we must first look at the language of the order dated
19-1-2007 [Union of India v. Assn. of Unified Telecom Service Providers of India,
Civil Appeal No. 84 of 2007 decided on 19-1-2007 (SC)] of this Court in Civil Appeal
No. 84 of 2007. The order dated 19-1- 2007 [Union of India v. Assn. of Unified
Telecom Service Providers of India, Civil Appeal No. 84 of 2007 decided on 19-
1-2007 (SC)] is quoted hereinbelow:
―Heard the parties. Pursuant to the direction of TDSAT in the impugned order, a fresh
recommendation has been made by TRAI. In view thereof, we see no reasons to interfere. The
appeal is dismissed. The appellant is, however, given liberty to urge the contentions raised in this
petition before TDSAT.(cid:130) (emphasis supplied) PART E It will be clear from the language of the order
dated 19-1-2007 [Union of India v. Assn. of Unified Telecom Service Providers of India, Civil Appeal
No. 84 of 2007 decided on 19-1-2007 (SC)] that while dismissing the appeal, the Court has given
liberty to the appellant, namely, Union of India, to urge the contentions raised in Civil Appeal No.
84 of 2007.
34...Thus, as per the express language of the order dated 19- 1-2007 [Union of India v. Assn. of
Unified Telecom Service Providers of India, Civil Appeal No. 84 of 2007 decided on 19- 1-2007 (SC)]
of this Court in Civil Appeal No. 84 of 2007, the Union of India could raise each of the grounds
extracted above before the Tribunal. Hence, even if we hold that the order dated 7-7-2006 of the
Tribunal got merged with the order dated 19-1-2007 [Union of India v. Assn. of Unified Telecom
Service Providers of India, Civil Appeal No. 84 of 2007 decided on 19-1-2007 (SC)] of this Court
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 26Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
passed in Civil Appeal No. 84 of 2007, by the express liberty granted by this Court in the order dated
19-1-2007 [Union of India v. Assn. of Unified Telecom Service Providers of India, Civil Appeal No.
84 of 2007 decided on 19-1-2007 (SC)] , the Union of India could urge before the Tribunal all the
contentions covered under Grounds 1 to 6 extracted above including the contention that the
definition of adjusted gross revenue as given in the licence could not be challenged by the licensees
before the Tribunal and will include all items of revenue mentioned in the definition of adjusted
gross revenue in the licence.(cid:130) 37 Apart from the above, it must be noted that the appellant made no
effort to urge during the course of the submissions before the Court in CPIL (supra) that they should
be allowed a refund of Entry Fee in the event that the Court were to quash the process and the award
of licences. Significantly, the appellant did not seek the permission of this Court at that stage to
reserve their liberties of agitating a claim for refund of Entry Fee in separate proceedings. Besides
having such a course of action open to them before the judgment was delivered, the appellants had
their remedies open in law even after the decision by seeking liberty of adopting independent PART
E proceedings for agitating the refund of the Entry Fee. Not having done this at any stage in, or in
connection with, the proceedings relating to the decision in CPIL (supra), the appellant cannot be
permitted to do so subsequently. 38 Attempting to get over this hurdle, the appellant urged before
this Court that what could have been agitated in the course of the proceedings leading up to the
decision in CPIL (supra) can well be agitated in the present proceedings since the coram in both
cases would be the Supreme Court and the appellant is now in appeal before this Court against the
decision of the TDSAT. Such a course of action would not plainly be open to the appellant since the
jurisdiction which has been invoked presently in the civil appeal is the appellate jurisdiction arising
out of the decision of the TDSAT to reject the claim for refund of the Entry Fee. The conduct of the
appellant indicates that on 13 May 2016, the appellant sought to withdraw the appeals against the
order of the TDSAT. The Court had recorded – ―the appellant prays for liberty to withdraw the
present appeals and instead approach this Court once again if it becomes so necessary”. The
appellant ought to have obtained specific liberty of the Court on 13 May 2016 of pursuing
proceedings before the TDSAT, something which is conspicuous by its absence in the order which
was passed by this Court. Yet, the appellant chose to move the TDSAT by filing the Second Telecom
Petition. The TDSAT noted that the petition was a ―second attempt(cid:130) by the Appellant ―for claiming
the same relief(cid:130) which had been sought under the impugned order of the TDSAT. Thus, when the
appellant failed in seeking relief on 11 December 2018, it filed an appeal against the order of TDSAT
and then PART F moved this Court for restoration of the first set of appeals which was allowed on 7
January 2020. The course of action which has been adopted by the appellant is anything but fair —
withdrawing the civil appeals which were instituted against the first order of the TDSAT without
obtaining specific liberty or permission to move the TDSAT, instituting a second round of litigation
before the TDSAT, and then obtaining a revival of the first set of civil appeals. A party must not be
allowed to conduct litigation in this manner. Such a course of action is subject to grave abuse since it
lays bare an effort at forum-shopping and selectively deciding where and before whom it would
pursue its remedies. It is in this backdrop, that the failure of the appellant to be fair with the Court
when it addressed its submissions in the judicial process leading up to the decision in CPIL (supra)
must be assessed. For the above reasons we are of the view that the TDSAT has correctly come to the
conclusion that the claim by the appellant for refund of the Entry Fee could not have been
entertained.

F The claim founded on frustration and restitution 39 In this section of the judgment, we will
analyse the claim of the appellant that it is entitled to claim a refund of the Entry Fee on an
application of the doctrine of frustration and the principle of restitution. The appellant has placed
reliance on the provisions of Sections 56 and 65 of the Contract Act. The basic postulate of the
appellant is that when a licence is granted under the proviso to Section (4)(1) of the PART F
Telegraph Act, the licence is in the nature of a contract between the government and licensee, thus
bringing it within the ambit of the Indian Contract Act. 40 In AUSPI (supra), a two-judge Bench of
this Court has held:
―39. The proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Telegraph Act, however,
enables the Central Government to part with this exclusive privilege in favour of any
other person by granting a licence in his favour on such conditions and in
consideration of such payments as it thinks fit. As the Central Government owns the
exclusive privilege of carrying on telecommunication activities and as the Central
Government alone has the right to part with this privilege in favour of any person by
granting a licence in his favour on such conditions and in consideration of such terms
as it thinks fit, a licence granted under the proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 4 of
the Telegraph Act is in the nature of a contract between the Central Government and
the licensee.(cid:130) The principle which has been elucidated in the above extract is that
when the Union government parts with the exclusive privilege which is conferred
upon it by Section 4(1) of the Telegraph Act by granting a licence, the licence is in the
nature of contract between the Union government and the licensee.
41 It is on the above premise that the appellant seeks to invoke the application of the doctrine of
frustration of contract and of restoration. Section 56 of the Indian Contract Act provides as follows:
―56. Agreement to do impossible act.— An agreement to do an act impossible in itself
is void.
Contract to do act afterwards becoming impossible or unlawful.—A contract to do an act which, after
the contract is made, becomes impossible, or, by reason of some event PART F which the promisor
could not prevent, unlawful, becomes void when the act becomes impossible or unlawful.
Compensation for loss through non-performance of act known to be impossible or
unlawful.—Where one person has promised to do something which he knew, or, with reasonable
diligence, might have known, and which the promisee did not know, to be impossible or unlawful,
such promisor must make compensation to such promisee for any loss which such promisee
sustains through the non-
performance of the promise.(cid:130) 42 The doctrine of frustration is elucidated in the three-judge Bench
decision of this Court in Satyabrata Ghose v. Mugneeram Bangur & Co. 32 . Justice BK Mukherjee,
while explaining the doctrine of frustration, observed:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 28Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
―10. Although various theories have been propounded by the Judges and jurists in
England regarding the juridical basis of the doctrine of frustration, yet the essential
idea upon which the doctrine is based is that of impossibility of performance of the
contract; in fact impossibility and frustration are often used as interchangeable
expressions. The changed circumstances, it is said, make the performance of the
contract impossible and the parties are absolved from the further performance of the
contract impossible and the parties are absolved from the further performance of it as
they did not promise to perform an impossibility…We hold, therefore, that the
doctrine of frustration is really an aspect or part of the law of discharge of contract by
reason of supervening impossibility or illegality of the act agreed to be done and
hence comes within the purview of Section 56 of the Indian Contract Act. It would be
incorrect to say that Section 56 of the Contract Act applies only to cases of physical
impossibility and that where this section is not applicable, recourse can be had to the
principles of English law on the subject of frustration…(cid:130) 1954 SCR 310 PART F Thus,
it was held that the applicability of Section 56 of the Indian Contract Act is not
limited to cases of physical impossibility. The Court also noted that in deciding cases
in India, the only test which must apply ―is that of supervening impossibility or
illegality of the act agreed to be contractually done(cid:130). Thus, the Court enunciated the
doctrine underlying Section 56 by construing the word ―impossible(cid:130) in its practical
sense, not just in its literal sense. Similarly, Section 2033 of the Indian Contract Act
envisages a situation where an agreement is void when both parties are under a
mistake as to a matter of fact.
43 In Tarsem Singh (supra), this Court was confronted with a contract being void under Section 20
of the Indian Contract Act as the parties were under a mistake of fact regarding the metric for
assessing the area of land that was the subject of the contract. This Court, while interpreting the
expression ―discovered to be void(cid:130), held that these words comprehend a situation in which parties
were suffering from a mistake of fact from the very beginning but had not realized at the time of
entering into the agreement or signing of the documents that they were suffering from any such
mistake and had therefore acted bona fide while entering into such agreements. The agreement, as
the Court held, in that case was void from its inception and was discovered to be so at a much later
date. ―20. Agreement void where both parties are under mistake as to matter of fact.—Where both
the parties to an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement, the
agreement is void. Explanation.—An erroneous opinion as to the value of the thing which forms the
subject-matter of the agreement, is not to be deemed a mistake as to a matter of fact.(cid:130) PART F 44
The appellant, besides placing reliance on Tarsem Singh (supra), has urged that all judicial decisions
are retrospective (unless in a particular case this Court makes its judgment prospective) and hence,
the voidness which attaches to its UASLs would relate back to their very inception. It is on this basis
that the appellant stakes its claim for a refund of the Entry Fee based on the principle of restitution.
45 Section 65 of the Indian Contract Act recognizes the principle of restitution, particularly when a
contract is discovered to be or becomes void. It stipulates thus:
―65. Obligation of person who has received advantage under void agreement, or
contract that becomes void.— When an agreement is discovered to be void, or when a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 29Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
contract becomes void, any person who has received any advantage under such
agreement or contract is bound to restore it, or to make compensation for it, to the
person from whom he received it.(cid:130) 46 In Pollock & Mulla’s seminal treatise on the
Indian Contract Act34, it has been noted that Section 65 does not operate in
derogation of the maxim in pari delicto potior est conditio possidentis:
―Section 65 is not in derogation of the common law maxims ex dolo malo non oritur
actio and in pari delicto potior est conditio possidentis; and only those cases as are
not covered by these maxims can attract application of the provision of section 65 on
the footing that when an agreement in its inception was not void and it was not hit by
the maxims but is discovered to be void subsequently, right to restitution of the
advantage received under such agreement is secured on equitable consideration. The
section has been held not to R Yashod Vardhan and Chitra Narayan, Pollock & Mulla
The Indian Contract and Specific Relief Acts Volume I th (16 edition, LexisNexis)
PART F apply where both parties knew of the illegality at the time the agreement was
made, and were in pari delicto.(cid:130) Thus, the application of Section 65 has to be limited
to those cases were the party claiming restitution itself was not in pari delicto.
47 In The Principles of Law of Restitution35, it has been noted that all claims for
restitution are subject to a defence of illegality. The genesis of this defence is in the
legal maxim ex turpi causa non oritur actio (no action can arise from a bad cause). A
court will not assist those who aim to perpetuate illegality. This rule was initially
recognized by the House of Lords in its decision in Holman v. Johnson36. Lord
Mansfield held:
―The objection, that a contract is immoral or illegal as between the plaintiff and
defendant, sounds at all times very ill in the mouth of the defendant. It is not for his
sake, however, that the objection is ever allowed; but it is founded in general
principles of policy, which the defendant has the advantage of, contrary to the real
justice, as between him and the plaintiff, by accident, if I may so. The principle of
public policy is this; ex dolo malo non oritur actio. No Court will lend its aid to a man
who founds his cause of action upon an immoral or illegal act. If, from the plaintiff ’s
own stating or otherwise, the cause of action appears to arise ex turpi causa, or the
transgression of a positive law of this country, there the Court says he has no right to
be assisted.(cid:130) (emphasis supplied) 35 rd Graham Virgo, The Principles of the Law of
Restitution (3 edition, OUP) pg 710 (1775) 1 Cowp 341, 343; 98 ER 1120, 1121 PART F
The Principles of Law of Restitution subsequently notes that in pari delicto potior est
conditio possidentis is a way of qualifying the ex turpi causa defence37:
―This in pari delicto principle enables the court to analyse the particular
circumstances of the case to determine whether the claimant is less responsible for
the illegality than the defendant, for then, as between the claimant and the
defendant, the just result is that the claimant should not be denied relief, since the
parties are not in pari delicto. But where the claimant is more responsible for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 30Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
illegality or the parties are considered to be equally responsible, the in pari delicto
principle applies and restitution will be denied.(cid:130) (emphasis supplied) Thus, when the
party claiming restitution is equally or more responsible for the illegality of a
contract, they are considered in pari delicto.
48 In the decision of the UK Supreme Court in Patel v. Mirza38, Lord Sumption JSC has succinctly
explained the nature of the inquiry to determine whether a party is in pari delicto:
―241 To the principle that a person may not rely on his own illegal act in support of
his claim, there are significant exceptions, which are as old as the principle itself and
generally inherent in it. These are broadly summed up in the proposition that the
illegality principle is available only where the parties were in pari delicto in relation
to the illegal act. This principle must not be misunderstood.
It does not authorise a general inquiry into their relative blameworthiness. The question is whether
they were legally on the same footing. The case law discloses two main categories of case where the
law regards the parties as Supra at 35, pg 711 [2016] 3 WLR 399 PART F not being in pari delicto,
but both are based on the same principle.
242 One comprises cases in which the claimant’s participation in the illegal act is treated as
involuntary: for example, it may have been brought about by fraud, undue influence or duress on
the part of the defendant who seeks to invoke the defence… 243 The other category comprises cases
in which the application of the illegality principle would be inconsistent with the rule of law which
makes the act illegal. The paradigm case is a rule of law intended to protect persons such as the
plaintiff against exploitation by the likes of the defendant. Such a rule will commonly require the
plaintiff to have a remedy notwithstanding that he participated in its breach…(cid:130) (emphasis supplied)
Thus, in determining a claim of restitution, the claiming party’s legal footing in relation to the illegal
act (and in comparison to the defendant) must be understood. Unless the party claiming restitution
participated in the illegal act involuntarily or the rule of law offers them protection against the
defendant, they would be held to be in pari delicto and therefore, their claim for restitution will fail.
49 The position is in India is similar to that of the case of Kuju Collieries Ltd. v. Jharkhand Mines
Ltd.39, where a Bench of three learned judges of this Court relied on a judgment of a five-judge
bench of the then Hyderabad High Court. While construing the provisions of Section 65, this Court
held:
―8. A Full Bench of five Judges of the Hyderabad High Court in Budhulal v. Deccan
Banking Company [AIR 1955 Hyd 69 (FB) : ILR 1955 Hyd 101] speaking through our
brother, (1974) 2 SCC 533 PART F Jaganmohan Reddy, J. as he then was, referred
with approval to these observations of the Privy Council. They then went on to refer
to the observations of Pollock and Mulla in their treatise on Indian Contract and
Specific Relief Acts, 7th Edn. to the effect that Section 65, Indian Contract Act does
not apply to agreements which are void under Section 24 by reason of an unlawful
consideration or object and there being no other provision in the Act under which
money paid for an unlawful purpose may be recovered back, an analogy of English
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 31Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
Law will be the best guide. They then referred to the reasoning of the learned authors
that if the view of the Privy Council is right namely that “agreements discovered to be
void” apply to all agreements which are ab initio void including agreements based on
unlawful consideration, it follows that the person who has paid money or transferred
property to another for an illegal purpose can recover it back from the transferee
under this section even if the illegal purpose is carried into execution and both the
transferor and transferee are in pari delicto. The Bench then proceeded to observe:
―In our opinion, the view of the learned authors is neither supported by any of the subsequent Privy
Council decisions nor is it consistent with the natural meaning to be given to the provisions of
Section 65. The section by using the words ―when an agreement is discovered to be void(cid:130) means
nothing more nor less than: when the plaintiff comes to know or finds out that the agreement is
void. The word ―discovery(cid:130) would imply the pre-existence of something which is subsequently
found out and it may be observed that Section 66, Hyderabad Contract Act makes the knowledge
(Ilm) of the agreement being void as one of the pre-requisites for restitution and is used in the sense
of an agreement being discovered to be void. If knowledge is an essential requisite even an
agreement ab initio void can be discovered to be void subsequently. There may be cases where
parties enter into an agreement honestly thinking that it is a perfectly legal agreement and where
one of them sues the other or wants the other to act on it, it is then that he may discover it to be
void. There is nothing specific in Section 65, Indian Contract Act or its corresponding section of the
Hyderabad Contract Act to make it inapplicable to such cases.
A person who, however, gives money for an unlawful purpose knowing it to be so, or in such
circumstances PART F that knowledge of illegality or unlawfulness can as a finding of fact be
imputed to him, the agreement under which the payment is made cannot on his part be said to be
discovered to be void. The criticism that if the aforesaid view is right then a person who has paid
money or transferred property to another for illegal purpose can recover it back from the transferee
under this section even if the illegal purpose is carried into execution, notwithstanding the fact that
both the transferor and transferee are in pari delicto, in our view, overlooks the fact that the courts
do not assist a person who comes with unclean hands. In such cases, the defendant possesses an
advantage over the plaintiff — in pari delicto potior est conditio defendentio.
Section 84, Indian Trust Act, however, has made an exception in a case — where the owner of
property transfers it to another for illegal purpose and such purpose is not carried into execution or
the transferor is not as guilty as the transferee or the effect of permitting the transferee to retain the
property might be to defeat the provisions of any law the transferee must hold the property for the
benefit of the transferor.
This specific provision made by the legislature cannot be taken advantage of in derogation of the
principle that Section 65, Contract Act, is inapplicable where the object of the agreement was illegal
to the knowledge of both the parties at the time it was made. In such a case the agreement would be
void ab initio and there would be no room for the subsequent discovery of that fact.(cid:130) We consider
that this criticism as well as the view taken by the Bench is justified. It has rightly pointed out that if
both the transferor and transferee are in pari delicto the courts do not assist them.(cid:130) (emphasis
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 32Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
supplied) While upholding the view of the Hyderabad High Court, this Court held ―it [the Full
Bench of the Hyderabad High Court] has rightly pointed out that if both the transferor and
transferee are in pari delicto the courts do not assist them(cid:130). PART F 50 In an earlier decision of this
Court in Inmani Appa Rao v. Gollapalli Ramalingamurthi40, a three-judge Bench held that where
both the parties before the Court are confederates in the fraud, the Court must lean in favour of the
approach which would be less injurious to public interest. Justice P B Gajendragadkar (as he then
was), speaking for the Court, held:
―12. Reported decisions bearing on this question show that consideration of this
problem often gives rise to what may be described as a battle of legal maxims. The
appellants emphasised that the doctrine which is pre-eminently applicable to the
present case is ex dolo malo non oritur actio or ex turpi causa non oritur actio. In
other words, they contended that the right of action cannot arise out of fraud or out
of transgression of law; and according to them it is necessary in such a case that
possession should rest where it lies in pari delicto potior est conditio possidentis;
where each party is equally in fraud the law favours him who is actually in
possession, or where both parties are equally guilty the estate will lie where it falls.
On the other hand, Respondent 1 argues that the proper maxim to apply is nemo
allegans suam turpitudinum audiendum est, whoever has first to plead turpitudinum
should fail; that party fails who first has to allege fraud in which he participated. In
other words, the principle invoked by Respondent 1 is that a man cannot plead his
own fraud. In deciding the question as to which maxim should govern the present
case it is necessary to recall what Lord Wright, M.R. observed about these maxims in
Berg v. Sadler and Moore [(1937) 2 KB 158 at p. 62] . Referring to the maxim ex turpi
causa non oritur actio Lord Wright observed that ―this maxim, though veiled in the
dignity of learned language, is a statement of a principle of great importance;
but like most maxims it is much too vague and much too general to admit of application without a
careful consideration of the circumstances and of the various definite rules which have been laid
down by the authorities(cid:130). Therefore, in deciding the question raised in the present appeal it would
be necessary for us to consider carefully the true scope and (1962) 3 SCR 739 (―Inmani Appa Rao(cid:130))
PART F effect of the maxims pressed into service by the rival parties, and to enquire which of the
maxims would be relevant and applicable in the circumstances of the case. It is common ground that
the approach of the Court in determining the present dispute must be conditioned solely by
considerations of public policy. Which principle would be more conducive to, and more consistent
with, public interest, that is the crux of the matter. To put it differently, having regard to the fact
that both the parties before the Court are confederates in the fraud, which approach would be less
injurious to public interest. Whichever approach is adopted one party would succeed and the other
would fail, and so it is necessary to enquire as to which party's success would be less injurious to
public interest.(cid:130) (emphasis supplied) 51 The principle which was enunciated in the judgment in
Inmani Appa Rao (supra) has been more recently applied in a decision of a three-judge Bench of this
Court in Narayanamma v. Govindappa41. The Court held:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 33Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
―28. Now, let us apply the other test laid down in Immani Appa Rao [Immani Appa
Rao v. Gollapalli Ramalingamurthi, (1962) 3 SCR 739 : AIR 1962 SC 370] . At the cost
of repetition, both the parties are common participator in the illegality. In such a
situation, the balance of justice would tilt in whose favour is the question. As held in
Immani Appa Rao [Immani Appa Rao v. Gollapalli Ramalingamurthi, (1962) 3 SCR
739 : AIR 1962 SC 370] , if the decree is granted in favour of the plaintiff on the basis
of an illegal agreement which is hit by a statute, it will be rendering an active
assistance of the court in enforcing an agreement which is contrary to law. As against
this, if the balance is tilted towards the defendants, no doubt that they would stand
benefited even in spite of their predecessor-in-title committing an illegality.
However, what the court would be doing is only rendering an assistance which is
purely of a passive 2019 (19) SCC 42 PART F character. As held by Gajendragadkar,
J. in Immani Appa Rao [Immani Appa Rao v. Gollapalli Ramalingamurthi, (1962) 3
SCR 739 : AIR 1962 SC 370] , the first course would be clearly and patently
inconsistent with the public interest whereas, the latter course is lesser injurious to
public interest than the former.(cid:130) 52 Hence, in adjudicating a claim of restitution
under Section 65 of the Indian Contract Act, the court must determine the illegality
which caused the contract to become void and the role the party claiming restitution
has played in it. If the party claiming restitution was equally or more responsible for
the illegality (in comparison to the defendant), there shall be no cause for restitution.
This has to be determined on the facts of each individual case.
53 The appellant before us has relied upon the decision of TDSAT in S Tel Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of
India42 to establish that the blame for quashing of the UASLs lies with the Union government
alone. The issue which came up for decision before the TDSAT in that case was whether the
petitioner was entitled to the refund of the money which it paid for allocation of 3G spectrum under
licences which were later quashed by the judgment of this Court. In that case, the petitioner had
applied for UASLs in six circles/service areas on 7 July 2007. The Government issued a press note
on 24 September 2007 prescribing a cut-off date of 10 October 2007 for submissions of applications
for a fresh UASL. On 28 September 2007, the petitioner applied for UASLs in sixteen circles in
addition to its earlier application for six circles.
2015 SCC OnLine TDSAT 1 (―S Tel(cid:130)) PART F On 10 January 2008, by another press note, the
deadline for fresh licences was retrospectively advanced to 25 September 2007. On the same day,
the government granted licences to 122 applicants, including the petitioner's previous application
for six circles, whose applications had been received prior to 25 September 2007. Against the denial
of licences for sixteen circles on the ground that the application was made beyond the cut-off date,
the petitioner moved the Delhi High Court challenging the action of the government in
retrospectively advancing the last date for submission of applications as arbitrary. The High Court
held that the decision to fix the cut off-date for making applications, with a view to limit the number
of service providers was contrary to the decision of the TRAI which the government had purported
to accept. The government was accordingly directed to consider the petitioner’s application which
was submitted on 28 September 2007. The Division Bench having dismissed an intra court appeal,
led to proceedings before this Court. The Attorney General stated that the application submitted by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 34Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
the petitioner was not rejected but was held in abeyance and it would be considered on a
first-come-first- serve basis in terms of the then prevailing policy in consultation with the TRAI.
This Court disposed of the appeal while sustaining the findings recorded by the Delhi High Court in
regard to the change in the cut-off dates. For the purpose of the present discussion, it would not be
necessary to advert to the detailed analysis in the above case, save and except to note that the
petitioner moved the TDSAT claiming a refund of the amount which it had paid for the 3G spectrum
in three service areas. Significantly in that case, the TDSAT observed: PART F ―In course of hearing
of the case we repeatedly asked Mr. Banerjee what blame, if any, for the quashing of its licences
extends to the petitioner. Mr. Banerjee was unable to show anything from the Supreme Court
judgment in Centre for Public Interest Litigation or from the Government records that might show
that the petitioner was in any way responsible for the quashing of its licences.
It is thus clear that though the petitioner’s UAS licences were declared illegal and quashed, that was
not due to any fault by the petitioner but on account of the illegalities committed by the Government
in the issuance of those one hundred and twenty two (122) licences. While discussing the provisions
of clauses 3.6 and 3.7 of the NIA it is noted above that those clauses deal with a situation where the
licence is cancelled/terminated at the instance of the licensor for some fault on the part of the
licensee. The quashing of the petitioner’s licences in the present case thus clearly does not fall under
the two clauses in the NIA. Further, as a result of the quashing of the petitioner's licences its
contract with the Government relating to 3G spectrum got discharged on account of frustration, as
provided under section 56 of the Contract Act, leaving it open to the petitioner to seek the relief of
restitution in terms of section 65 of the Contract Act.(cid:130) The decision of the TDSAT to allow a refund
is thus clearly postulated on the principle that the petitioner was not at fault, but the UASLs were
quashed because of the illegalities committed by the government. Therefore, there is a clear
distinction between the facts as they emerged before the TDSAT in S Tel (supra) and the facts of the
present case.
54 In the present case, the appellant has been held to be in pari delicto. The decision of this Court in
CPIL (supra) leaves no manner of doubt that the appellant was among the group of licensees who
were found to be complicit in obtaining benefits under the ―First Come First Serve(cid:130) policy of the
Union government at the PART G cost of the public exchequer. In such a situation and following the
well-settled principles which have been enunciated above, the appellant could not be held entitled to
claim a refund of its Entry Fee.
55 On behalf of the appellant, it is sought to be urged that in the auction which followed the decision
in CPIL (supra), the Union government granted fresh licences including for the areas which were
governed by the licences in favour of the appellant at a much higher value. This argument is
completely unacceptable for the simple reason that if the Union government had held a transparent
and objective process of conducting an auction when the initial licences were granted in favour of
the appellant, a much higher value would have been realized by the public exchequer. The appellant
has been the beneficiary of a manifestly arbitrary policy which was adopted by the Union
government and which was quashed in the decision of this Court in CPIL (supra). That being the
position, the appellant would not be entitled to a refund of the Entry Fee even on the principle of
restitution embodied in Section 65 of the Indian Contract Act.

G The policy of set off
56 According to the appellant, the set off which was granted by the Union
government in pursuance of the decision of the EGoM on 31 October 2012, constitutes an admission
of liability. In this backdrop, it has been submitted that the policy which was adopted by the Union
government by allowing a set off to licensees PART G whose licences have been quashed subject to
their participating in and being found successful in the fresh auction, suffers from manifest
arbitrariness. 57 By the judgment of this Court in the CPIL (supra), the licensees whose licences had
been quashed were not barred from participating in the subsequent auction for the grant of fresh
licences. On 12 October 2012, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology issued a
document titled ―Queries and Responses to the NIA for competitive bids for allocation of spectrum
issued by the DoT(cid:130). Among the queries, which were in the nature of Frequently Asked Questions,
Query Numbers 74 and 75 and the response were in the following terms: ―74. i) The original entry
level Pan India A set off is allowed against the Earnest license fee of Rs. 1506.82 crore (along with
Money and the payment due in the event of interest from the date of payment of such spectrum

respect of the quashed 21 UASL, xxx shall obviously pay such additionally.
ii) The bank guarantees originally submitted with Required bank guarantees in the event of winning

event there would be any shortfall in the bank guarantees required to be submitted by xxx on

UASL, xxx shall PART G obviously submit such bank guarantees additionally.
75. i) We would like to seek clarity with regards to This cannot be clarified at this stage
Government’s position on levying ―One Time Charge(cid:130) on the incumbent Operators before the
auction, so that we could arrive at a well-
informed decision with regards to our participation in the auction.
ii) The price already paid by xxx at the time of Please refer to response to query at Sl.no. 74.(cid:130)
issuance of licenses in 2008 should be adjusted in totality towards the auction price in case we are
successful in auction else it should be refunded in totality. (Not to be linked Circle wise) (emphasis
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 36Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
supplied) 58 On 31 October 2012, the Cabinet Secretariat of the Union government circulated the
Minutes of the Meeting of the EGoM held on 18 October 2012. The Minutes contain the rationale for
the adoption of a policy of set off in the following terms:
―13. The EGoM considered the letter dated 12.10.2012 from the Minister of
Information & Broadcasting regarding set-off of entry fee against earnest money and
payment due in the event of spectrum being won and noted that the entry fee paid by
TSPs whose licenses were quashed was for a period of 20 years. While on the one
hand, the TSPs could be expected to have paid a pro-rata amount for the period of
operation of the license, i.e. 2008-2012, on the other hand, there could be a claim for
refund with interest for the pro-rata amount for the balance period. Therefore, the
EGoM decided to allow such TSPs to adjust an amount equivalent to their full entry
fee, without any interest, against the auction payments, both for participation and for
final payment on successful conclusion. It was clarified that the set-off would be
permitted only to the quashed license holders participating in the auction. Such set
off would be allowed to the extent of total entry fee paid for all quashed licenses on an
aggregate basis PART G without consideration of the expired period of license, only if
they succeed in the auction. The set off will be permitted against the Earnest Money
Bank Guarantee amount initially and later against the amount payable for auction
price, irrespective of the number of Local Service Areas (LSAs) in which the holder of
quashed license is successful in the auction and without requiring correlation
between LSAs in which licenses were held earlier and the LSAs in which the holder of
the quashed licenses is successful.(cid:130) The Union government has submitted before this
Court that the set off policy was formulated in order to encourage participation of all
telecom operators in the subsequent auction, increasing the possibility of higher price
discovery to the benefit of the public exchequer. It has been urged that the set off
policy was aimed at the revival of the telecom industry in a manner which encouraged
uninterrupted supply of services. The policy sought to increase participation at a
subsequent auction by offering a concession in the form of a set off of the previously
paid Entry Fee, in case the bidder had emerged successful in the fresh auction.
PART H The appellant did not challenge the policy per se at that stage, nor did it attempt to enter
into the fray at that stage when a fresh auction was held. In these circumstances, the policy decision
adopted by the Union government cannot be allowed to be questioned at the behest of the appellant
who sought a refund simpliciter in proceedings before the TDSAT. As held by a Constitution Bench
in R K Garg v. Union of India 43, a greater free play in the joints must be accorded to decisions of
economic policy where the legislature or the executive is called upon to make complex choices which
cannot always conform to a straitjacket or doctrinaire solution.
59 For the above reasons, we do not find any reason to entertain the challenge to the set off policy at
this stage at the behest of the appellant.
H Conclusion
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/43797532/ 37Loop Telecom And Trading Limited vs Union Of India on 3 March, 2022
60 For the above reasons, we have come to the conclusion that the appellant
was in pari delicto with DoT and the then officials of the Union government. The appellant was the
beneficiary of the ―First Come First Serve(cid:130) policy which was intended to favour a group of private
bidding entities at the cost of the public exchequer. The contention of the appellant that it was
exculpated from any wrong doing by the judgment of this Court in CPIL (supra) is patently
erroneous. The process leading up to the award of the UASLs and the allocation of the 2G spectrum
(1981) 4 SCC 675 PART H was found to be arbitrary and constitutionally infirm. The need for an
open and transparent bidding process for the allocation of natural resources was substituted by a
process which was designed to confer unlawful benefits on a group of selected bidders by which the
appellant benefitted. The appellant has tried to obviate these findings by relying on its acquittal by
the Special Judge, CBI. It is important to note that the criminal trial before the Special Judge, CBI
was limited to the question as to whether the promoters of the appellant had cheated the DoT by
providing a false representation of its compliance with Clause 8 of the UASL Guidelines, since it was
allegedly being controlled by the Essar group. The Special Judge, CBI acquitted the promoters of the
appellant since the prosecution was unable to prove that: (i) officers of DoT considered the
representation of the appellant to be false; (ii) the appellant was engaging in a sham transaction; or
(iii) the appellant was actually controlled by the Essar group. Hence, the acquittal of the promoters
of the appellant of these criminal charges does not efface or obliterate the findings which are
contained in the final judgment of this Court in CPIL (supra). Hence, as a beneficiary and
confederate of fraud, the appellant cannot be lent the assistance of this Court for obtaining the
refund of the Entry Fee. In any event, such a course of action before the TDSAT was clearly in the
teeth of the judgment of this Court in CPIL (supra).
PART H 61 For the above reasons, we have come to the conclusion that there is no merit in the
appeals. The appeals are accordingly dismissed. 62 Pending application(s), if any, stand disposed of.
