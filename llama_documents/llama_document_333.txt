ORDER
Justice Arun Kumar Goel (Retd.) President.
1. As ordered on 25.8.2008 and 10.11.2008, Sh.
Davinder Singh, Clerk from the O/o Registeration and Licencing Authority, Kullu is poresent with
the original record relating to Driving Licence of Driver Shesh Ram, S/o Sh. Dewat Ram, R/o Village
Goshal, P.O. Behang, Tehsil Manali, District Kullu, H.P. We have examined this original record. As
per entries in the register of Driving Licence, Shesh Ram was issued driving licence on 13.6.1994
which was valid upto 2024. He was licenced to drive LMV (non transport). This position could not
be disputed on behalf of the appellant. However, Sh. Thakur on behalf of the appellant stated that
his client had got the licence verified as per copy of driving licence provided by the respondent to his
client.
2. We are of the view, that in the face of the decision of Honble Supreme Court of India in the case of
National Insurance Company Ltd. V/s Annapa Irappa Nesaria Alias Nesaragi and Others (2008) 3
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24698029/ 3M/S Rattan Fruit Company vs M/S Rajinder Singh Chauhan on 3 March, 2009
Supreme Court Cases 464, the decision of this Appeal need not detain us. Reason being that the
admittedly driving licence in question was issued in favour of Shesh Ram before 28.3.2001 i.e the
date when Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989, whereby Form No. 4 of the Central Motor Vehicle
Rules was amended.
3. Crux of this decision is that the licences issued prior to 28.3.2001 to drive LMV without
endorsement to drive a transport vehicle, can also drive a transport vehicle. Faced with this
situation Sh. Thakur was not in a position to stress his submissions further as set out in the grounds
of appeal.
4. In view of the aforesaid factual position and keeping in view the decision of the Honble Supreme
Court, this appeal deserves to be dismissed. Ordered accordingly. Consequently all interim orders
passed from time to time shall stand vacated forthwith. No costs.
5. Learned counsel for the parties have undertaken to collect the copy of this order free of cost from
the Court Secretary, as per Rules.

Whether approved for reporting ?
For the Appellant. Mr. Peeyush Verma, Advocate For the Respondent. Mr. S.S.Roach, Advocate
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ORDER Per Mrs. Saroj
Sharma, Member.
1. Questions involved in the present appeal for consideration are, whether the respondent is a
consumer within the meaning of section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986; whether
there is consumer dispute; and whether the appellant was rendering any service for consideration
and is a service provider and if so, then its effect.
2. In order to determine all these questions, brief facts need to be noted here from the complaint
file. Respondent is an orchardist having orchards at Padara. He forwarded 150 apple cases by the
name of K.B. Padara, and 16 apple cases by the name of ACO Padara for sale to the appellant.
Appellant sold these boxes and did not pay the amount to the respondent despite notice. Thus the
appellant committed deficiency in service by not making the payment of the sale proceeds.
Complaint was filed by the present respondent for a direction to the appellant to pay Rs. 67,825/- as
sale price of apple produce alongwith interest @ 12% per annum w.e.f 15.9.2005 alongwith
compensation amounting to Rs. 10,000/-, as well as litigation cost. The complaint was allowed and
the appellant was directed to pay Rs. 67,825/- to the respondent alongwith interest at the rate of 9%
per annum w.e.f date of filing of the complaint i.e. 2.8.2006 till the actual payment is made, and Rs.
3000/- as litigation cost. These payments were ordered to be made within 45 days of the receipt of
copy of the impugned order.
3. Feeling aggrieved with the impugned order, the appellant has filed this appeal. The complaint was
contested by the appellant.
According to him, the complaint was neither maintainable nor there was a consumer dispute within
the meaning of Section 2 (1) (d) (ii) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. There was no consumer
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/24698029/ 5M/S Rattan Fruit Company vs M/S Rajinder Singh Chauhan on 3 March, 2009
dispute between the parties.
4. We have heard learned counsel for both the parties, as well as have gone through the record of the
complaint file. Counsel for the appellant submitted neither the respondent is a consumer nor his
client is a service provider. He further argued that in case this plea is not accepted, then the service
was provided free of charge by his client. There was no consideration received for rendering service
to the respondent. Further there was no question of appellants having indulged into unfair trade
practice. Further according to the appellants learned counsel, it is purely case of settlement of
accounts. Thus he prayed for allowing the appeal by setting aside the impugned order and
consequently dismissing the complaint while allowing this appeal.
5. These pleas were seriously contested by learned counsel for the respondent. According to him,
this is a case of pure and simple deficiency in service on the part of appellant who after selling the
apple boxes, did not pay the sale price to the respondent. So by doing so, the appellant indulged into
unfair trade practice. Appellant being a service provider was under obligation to account for the sale
proceeds. So there is deficiency in service also on the part of the appellant.
6. In order to be a consumer it is the duty of the respondent to show that he hired the services of the
appellant and the same were for consideration.
But in the present case, there is nothing on record to suggest that any consideration was paid/settled
by the respondent to be payable to the appellant for hiring his services and as such the service
rendered was free of any charge. So this cannot be termed as service for consideration. So question
of deficiency in service does not arise. No service was hired for consideration. The appellant is not
rendering any service within the meaning of Section 2(1)(o) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
For ready reference, this sub section is extracted hereinbelow :-
Service means service of any description which is made available to potential [users and includes,
but not limited to, the provision of] facilities in connection with banking, financing insurance,
transport, processing, supply of electrical or other energy, board or lodging or both, [housing
construction,] entertainment, amusement or the purveying of news or other information, but does
not include the rendering of any service free of charge or under a contract of personal service.

7. So we are of the considered view that the respondent was not a consumer when he sent the apple
boxes for sale to the appellant. We are further of the view that the sale of apple boxes was being
affected free of charge by the appellant. As such there is no deficiency in service within the meaning
of Section 2 (1)(o) of the Consumer Protection Act. The case is squarely covered by the order passed
in F.A. No. 01/2008 decided on 2.2.2009 titled as Chuni Lal Prop. V/s Madan Sharma, by this
Commission, which is nearer to the facts of the present appeal.
8. In view of the above discussion, while allowing this appeal, we hold that the appellant was neither
a service provider nor the respondent is a consumer and that it is not a case of deficiency in service.
Consequently the present appeal is allowed and order passed by the District Forum, Shimla, in
complaint No. 229/2006, dated 7.1.2008 is hereby quashed and set aside and the complaint is
dismissed. It is however clarified that the dismissal of the complaint will not debar the respondent
from taking such recourse under law for redressal of his grievances against the appellant as is
available to him under the ordinary law of the land and in such a situation, he will be entitled to the
benefit of Section 14 of the Limitation Act.
9. All interim orders passed from time to time shall stand vacated forthwith.
10. Learned counsel for the parties have undertaken to collect the copy of this order free of cost from
the Court Secretary as per Rules.
