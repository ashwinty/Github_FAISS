JUDGMENT
Per Sri Rajendra Singh, Member- The brief facts of the case are that, that the opposite parties are a
company engaged in the construction/development and allotment of the flats with all the basic civil
amenities, lucrative advertisement were made by the opposite parties to attract the consumer in the
market demonstrating themselves to be pioneered in the construction and development activities.
On the assurance of the timely construction the complainant applied for residential accommodation
in the scheme through application dated 19.2.2012. It is assured by the opposite parties that they
shall construct the apartment within 42 months. The opposite parties assured all its buyers that they
have all the necessary pre-requisite permission from the competent authorities to construct the
apartments. This assurance influenced the mind of the complainant and she opted for a residential
unit. The opposite parties by means of letter of allotment dated 16.4.2012 allotted unit reference
no.GDI0240104, situated in Garden Isles, the area of the unit is admeasuring 1205 sq. ft, total cost
of the flat is agreed to Rs.51,07,355.00. It was reiterated by the builder in this letter of allotment that
the possession of this unit shall be delivered within a period of 42 months.
It is agreed between the parties that the payment of the installments is to be made in accordance
with the development of the unit, the last installment is to be paid by the complainant at the time
when the opposite parties offer the physical possession of the fully developed unit. Thus, it is
obligatory on the part of the opposite parties to complete the construction of the unit in agreed
period of time. The opposite parties in a most illegal and arbitrary manner did not abide with their
assurance of the timely construction of the unit and the project work is not completed by the
opposite parties in schedule period of time that is till 16.10.2015 (42 months) per contra the
complainant deposited the entire sale consideration amounting to Rs.35,14,033.00 with the
opposite parties, however, the project work is t halt and there is no construction activities which are
being done by the builder as on site, the entire sale consideration deposited by the complainant is
being illegally and arbitrarily retained by the opposite parties.
The opposite parties demonstrated that they are in the possession of the land where the project is
situated and theypossess all the necessary pre-requisite permission to construct the apartment from
the competent authority, further it was assured to the consumer akin to other similarly placed
allottees that the land is encumbrance free and the possession of the unit shall be provided within
agreed/scheduled period of time, it is also demonstrated by the builder that the scheme is
sanctioned and approved by the bank and the finance facilities are also available, all these factors
influence the mind of the innocent consumers who are in direct need of a residential unit.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139157900/ 3Mis Milan Bansal vs Jaypee Infratech Pvt Ltd on 14 September, 2022
It is worth to submit here that the terms and conditions addendum to agreement are contained in a
standard format, which is akin and common for all the allottees in the entire project, the
complainant has no alternative option except to put his signatures on the dotted lines, no alteration
or amendment in these unilateral terms and conditions which are drafted and intended to best suit
the convenience of the builder can be made by the complainant.
The opposite parties at the time of the deposit of the booking amount assured the complainant that
the possession of the flat shall be delivered with all the civil amenities till 16.10.2015 (within 42
months), it was specifically assured by the opposite parties that the requisite permission from all the
concerned authorities to construct the apartment has already been obtained by them after taking the
possession of the land. It is pertinent to mention here that had the opposite parties communicated
to the complainant that they shall delay the construction of the entire project then the complainant
would not had opted for a flat in the scheme of the opposite parties. It is worth to mention here that
the complainant is deprive of his legal right to enjoy the possession of the flat.
with effect from the 16.10.2015 and is being put to extreme mental and physical harassment by the
builder.
From the aforementioned facts it is amply clear that the opposite parties obtained huge sum of
money from the entire allottees of the scheme and instead of putting the same for the development
of the flats misappropriate the same, for which the opposite parties are liable to produce the
expenditure and account statement of the scheme before this Hon'ble Commission.
The opposite parties have committed serious deficiency in services by not delivering the physical
possession of the fully developed allotted apartment to the complainant within the agreed period of
time, the conduct of the builder in this case established the fact that he was always interested in
claiming the money on the pretext of the construction of the flat and did not bother to construct the
flat in the agreed period of time, it is worth to mention here that he complainant deposited the
money with the builder with a hope for a roof on his bead, but till this date the builder did not
completed the allotted flat of the complainant despite of the fact that an amount of Rs.35,14,033.00
stood deposited by the complainant with the opposite parties and the money is being utilized by the
builder till the filing of this complaint petition. The opposite parties are also accountable for unfair
trade practice since they have enjoyed and utilize the hard earned money of the complainant without
providing the possession of the apartment within agreed period of time with all the basis amenities.
It is submitted here that the opposite parties are also liable to pay the loss of rent to the complainant
which is quantified by the complainant to the tune of Rs.20,000.00 per month with effect from
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139157900/ 4Mis Milan Bansal vs Jaypee Infratech Pvt Ltd on 14 September, 2022
16.10.2015 till the date of the refund of the entire deposited amount along with interest. The
complainant is entitled for the following reliefs:
Direct the opposite parties to refund an amount of Rs.35,14,033.00 along with interest at the rate of
24% from the dates of respective deposits till the date of actual refund.
Direct the opposite parties to pay an amount of Rs.20,000.00 towards rent with effect from
16.10.2015 till the date of the refund of the deposited amount along with interest.
Direct the opposite parties to pay appropriate compensation and damages witch this Hon'ble
Commission may deem it just and proper in the facts and circumstances of this case.
Direct the opposite parties to pay punitive damages to the complainant which this Hon'ble
Commission may deem it just and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case.
Allow the complaint and direct the opposite parties to pay a sum of Rs.1,00,000.00 towards cost of
the case.
Any other order which this Hon'ble Commission may deem fit and proper in the circumstances of
the case may also be passed.
The opposite parties have filed theirwritten statement stating that the instant complaint under reply
herein is completely devoid of merits and has been filed with the sole motive to harass the
respondents herein, abuse the process of law and to extort benefits from the respondents herein
which cannot be countenanced in any manner whatsoever. There is no negligence, deficiency in
service on their part nor have the respondents indulged in any unfair trade practice. The
complainant has no locus to complain about the purported delay in completion of the project which
in any case occurred due to force majeure conditions. Therefore, the purported grievance of
complainant is baseless, devoid of merit and is infact tainted with malafides.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139157900/ 5Mis Milan Bansal vs Jaypee Infratech Pvt Ltd on 14 September, 2022
The complainant is not interested in the possession of the subject apartment as she has not sought
any claim for possession in the instant complaint. It is also pertinent to mention here that the
complainant have admitted agreed in para 11 of the complaint that she has incurred the loss of rent
of Rs.20,000.00 per month and therefore, it is crystal clear that the subject apartment was booked
for profit making purpose. The complainant has booked the flat in question for speculating in the
real estate market and not for her personal use. As such she is not consumer as defined under
section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and the instant complaint filed by the
complainant is liable to be dismissed on this ground only.
It is submitted that the complainant has not claimed the possession of the subject unit in the instant
complaint and has only claimed the refund of amount paid by her alongwith the interest and
compensation towards loss of rent, compensation, damages in addition to the punitive damages
with the cost of the case at exorbitant rates. Thus, it is crystal clear that the complainant is not
interested in taking possession of the subject unit rather she wants to claim damages to generate
profit only. Therefore, the instant complaint is liable to be dismissed out rightly.
It is submitted that there is an arbitration clause no.10.9 for amicable settlement in the agreed
standard terms and conditions for the application form duly signed before the hand by the allottees
which provides as under:
"Dispute Resolution: Any and all disputes arising out the or in connection with or in relation hereto
shall so far as possible, in the first instance, be amicably settled between the company the applicant.
In the event of disputes, claim and/or differences not being amicably resolved such disputes shall be
referred to sole arbitration of a person nominated for the purpose by Chairman of the Company. The
proceedings of the Arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the
Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996, amended from time to time, or any rules made there under.
The application hereby gives his consent to the appointment the sole arbitrator as specified herein
above and waives any objections that he may have to such appoint or to the award that may be given
by the Arbitrator. The venue for the arbitration shall be New Delhi, India."
It is hereby clarified that the complainant has to approach to amicably settle the instant issue,
between the parties as provided in agreed standard terms and conditions. Therefore, the
complainant must invoke the arbitration clause after trying to amicably settle the dispute at the first
instance.

The respondents herein are also filing an application under section 8, of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996, however the present reply has been filed to comply with the limitation period
provided. Without prejudice to the application u/2 8, filed alongwith the present reply. It is also
pertinent to mention that the Hon'ble National Commission has admitted the application u/s 8 of
the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 in the complaint case no.1293/2016 titled as Kirat Singh
vs. Jaypee Infratech Ltd.&ors. and has been pleased to issue notice to the complainant in that cse
vide ordered dated 27.10.2016. Also in another case titled as Nitesh Chandok vs. today Homes and
Infrastructures Pvt. Ltd. C.C. no.900/2016, this the Hon'ble National Commission was pleased to
constitute the larger bench to hear and decide the arbitration application vide order dated
31.8.2016.
It is submitted that the claim regarding mental agony being imaginative and without any basis, do
not relate to the claim regarding the subject apartment. It is to be proved by the claimant with strict
proofs and therefore, the same is untenable in the eye of law and liable to be dismissed.
It is also relevant to mention here that the complainant has been violating the terms of the allotment
by failing to make payment of installments timely. It is submitted that on 7.2.2013 a notice for
cancellation was issued to the complainant with the request to make the payment of Rs.12,86,759/-.
Also as per the accounts maintained by the respondents in regular course of its business, an amount
of Rs.3,77,456.11 is due and payable by the complainant to the respondents including an amount of
Rs.47,117.69 on account of interest accrued on delayed payment of installments. It clearly shows
that the complainants are defaulters in timely payment of installments as per the payment plan of
allotment and therefore cannot take the benefit of her own wrong. Moreover, the complainant is
misleading the court by concealing these material facts. Therefore, the complaint is liable to be
dismissed on this count also. It is also pertinent to mention here that the respondents as a good
gesture provided a discount of Rs.200/- per sq. ft. to the complainant at the time of booking.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139157900/ 7Mis Milan Bansal vs Jaypee Infratech Pvt Ltd on 14 September, 2022
million sq. mt. (2500 hectare or 6175 acers) land (land for development (LFD) along the Expressway
at five or more locations, out of which one included Jaypee Greens Noida, Distt. G.B. Nagar.
As per the concession agreement with the Government of UP, the Jaypee Infratech Limited was
required to develop the Expressway from Noida to Agra and was to fund the cost of the project
either through developing five townships or by sale of land. The respondent in terms of the
concession agreement for Yamuna Expressway Project incorporated a special purpose vehicle
namely Jaypee Infratech Limited. The entire land for development i.e. at five locations including

Wish Town Project. One of the said sub-projects, which was launched by the Jaypee Infratech Ltd.

interalia proposed to allot premium apartments to its prospective buyers.
The complainant, at her own end made herself fully aware of the planning and actual site
development on the wishtown project. Only upon such satisfaction at their own end, regarding the
plans, terms and conditions of agreement etc. the complainant applied for booking of apartment by
submitting on application no.16171 dated 19.2.2012 for provisional allotment along with an

other condition which the company/JIL may prescribe."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139157900/ 8Mis Milan Bansal vs Jaypee Infratech Pvt Ltd on 14 September, 2022
Pursuant to the above, the respondents herein issued a provisional allotment letter dated 16.4.2012
allotting an apartment being unit reference no.GDI0240104 in "Garden Isles" sub-project of the
respondents admeasuring a super area of 111.94 sq. mtrs. in favour of the complainant herein. The
provisional allotment letter provided the consideration of the said unit as Rs.51,07,355.00 and a
payment plan was also provided therein. Further, the time period of possession was provided as 42
months in the said provisional Allotment letter subject to the standard terms and conditions agreed
by the complainant alongwith the grace period of 180 days.
It is stated that as per the approvals, the respondents herein carried out the development work on
the said project. However, for reasons beyond the control of the respondent therein i.e. due to force
majeure events such as shortage of labour, scarcity of water, restrictions in excavations, villager
agitations as well a legal impediments which continued to exist some time which cause delay in the
project and which such facts were duly brought to the notice of complainant herein. It is humbly
submitted that due to such events the delivery of project got reschedule.
It is opposite to note that at the time of booking of subject matter apartment it was agreed between
the parties (clause 7.1 of the standard terms and conditions) that in cse of force majeure events
including the events, the respondent would be entitled to extension of time without incurring any

"7.2 Nothing contained herein shall be construed to give rise to any right to a claim by way of

possession of the said premises."
It is stated that a serious law and order problem occurred in various land parcels due to agitation by
farmers. This restricted the peaceful development of the land given to the respondents. In the
existence of continuing agitation and without support of the State to control the law and order
despite requesting several times. Respondents were neither in a position to develop these lands nor
in a position to sell it to raise finances to cater for the development of the project at Noida.
As per the concession agreement with the Government of UP, the Jaypee Infratech Limited was
required to develop the Expressway from Noida to Agra and was to fund the cost of the project
either through developing five townships or by sale of land.
The respondent started developing the project in Noida. The funding required for the development
of the project was partly from sale of apartments and partly by sale of land at other land parcels. The
funding by sale of land at other land parcels halted due to farmer's agitation which led to a situation
where the respondent could not even enter upon its land parcels and so could not realize the
required funds for development for the already launched project. Whenever, the respondent got
some opportunity, it sold only a small part of land in Mirzapur land parcel and utilized the funds in
the project at Noida.
On 29.8.2014, the Government ordered for payment of additional incentive on 64.7% to farmers
further restricted the respondent from entering its land parcels, leading to total scarcity of funds for
development of the project.
After the increase in the compensation, the villagers stopped the work at the project stating that
until they get increased compensation, no work will be allowed at the project. The respondent being
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139157900/ 10Mis Milan Bansal vs Jaypee Infratech Pvt Ltd on 14 September, 2022
aggrieved wrote several letters to the district administration and the State Government but no action
was taken by them. This resulted in the land again becoming encumbered as neither it can be used
for development nor it can be transferred till the time the issue of additional compensation is
settled. Resultantly, the revenue generation of the respondent from the land stopped which resulted
in delay.
Additionally, in the year 2012 the State Government decided not to handover the Expressway
connecting Noida and Greater Noida to the respondent which was to be handed over to it as per the
terms of the concession agreement with an entitlement to collect and appropriate the toll. This
resulted in substantial loss of revenue to JIL, which revenue it would have generated and used for
the development of the land parcels.
Apart from above, it is a well-known fact that there has been an overall economic slowdown which
has not left real estate industry untouched.
Apart from the above, it is also relevant to mention herein that the Hon'ble National Green Tribunal
(NGT) vide its order dated 11.1.2013 restrained all builders of Noida & Greater Noida, including the
respondent, from extracting nay quantity of underground water for the purpose of construction or
otherwise and the said restriction is operative even today.
Apart from the above, it is also relevant to mention here that the National Green Tribunal vide its
interim order dated 14.8.2013 in application no.158 of 2013 titled as "Amit Kumar vs. Union of India
&ors." interalia directed that:
"The applicant is directed to point out the identity of other buildings which are allegedly within the
radius of 10 Km from Okhla Bird Sanctuary. The applicant also shall make serious attempt to
identify the names of such builders and shall apply for impleading them by next date of hearing. In
case the respondent no.6 will find during the course of such inspection that certain construction
work is going on within 10 Km radius of Okhla Bird Sanctuary without obtaining proper
Environmental Clearance or in contravention of the same then it shall be immediately stopped by
making necessary panchanamas and by preparing status report."
The said order was continued by order dated 17.9.2013 in the following terms:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139157900/ 11Mis Milan Bansal vs Jaypee Infratech Pvt Ltd on 14 September, 2022
"We make it clear that the earlier order restraining the construction without proper authority shall
be implemented scrupulously and the respondent no.7 (District Magistrate) and respondent no.8
(Seniour Superintendent of Police) are directed to see the restriction is implemented and no further
construction are done in respect of 49 units and report the same by the next date of hearing."
The National Green Tribunal vide its interim order dated 28.10.2013 further modified its earlier
orders as under:
"5. We make it clear that all the building constructions made within10 Km radius of the Okhla Bird
Sanctuary of within distance of eco-sensitive zone as may be prescribed by the Notification issued by
the MoEF shall be subject to the decision of the NBWL and till the time the clearance of NBWL is
obtained, the authority concerned shall not issue completion certificates to projects."
Subsequently, the National Green Tribunal vide its final order dated 3.4.2014 disposed of the said
application interalia holding as under:
"In such view of the matter, we dispose of the application with the following directions:
The State of Uttar Pradesh shall send its response to the queries raised by MoEF within two weeks
from the date of receipt of the copy of the order to the MoEF.
The State of Delhi as well as Haryana who are likely to be affected by fixation of eco-sensitive zone
shall also send their proposals to the MoEF within four weeks from today.
After receipt of the said proposal as well as comments by the respective governments within the time
stipulated above, we direct the Secretary, MoEF Government of India to call for the concerned
officers of all the State Governments concerned and have interaction and decide finally about the
fixation of the eco-sensitive zoned in respect of Okhla Bird Sanctuary.
While such decision is taken, the secretary, MoEF in the said meeting shall take into consideration
about the demarcation of boundaries in fixing the eco-sensitive zone apart from the issues as to
whether it is site specific etc. While making such decision the Secretary, Ministry of Environment
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139157900/ 12Mis Milan Bansal vs Jaypee Infratech Pvt Ltd on 14 September, 2022
and Forest shall also make necessary consultations with the National Board for Wildlife.
After such decision is taken in the meeting convened by the MoEF, the concerned State
Governments shall grant their consent within two weeks after the meeting. After such consent
obtained, the Ministry of Environment and Forest shall issue necessary notification as per the
powers conferred under the Environment Protection Act, 1986, expeditiously.
Till such notification is issued the interim order passed by this Tribunal as modified subsequently
shall continue to be in operation.
It is needless to state that any decision taken by the Government in notifying the Eco-sensitive Zone
shall be subject to the final decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the matter pending before it."
The respondent herein, thereafter filed an application being MA no.240 of 2014 for
review/modification of the judgment and other dated 3.4.2014 in application no.158 of 2013 before
the National Green Tribunal on 30.4.2014. However, the National Green Tribunal vide its judgment
and order dated 30.5.2014 dismissed the application being M.A.
No.240 of 2014 for review/modification of the judgment and order dated 3.4.2014 passed by the
National Green Tribunal.
Being aggrieved by the judgment and order dated 3.4.2014 passed in Original application no.158 of
2013 and judgment and order dated 30.5.2014 passed in review application being M.A. no.240 of
2014 in original application no.158 of 2013 passed by the National Green Tribunal, the respondents
herein filed a civil appeal being 5822-5823 of 2014 before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the
Hon'ble Supreme Court vide its order dated 10.6.2014 declined to interfere with the orders passed
by the National Green Tribunal and was pleased to dismiss the said Civil appeal filed by the
respondent herein.
In view of the aforesaid orders passed by the National Green Tribunal subsequently affirmed by the
Hon'ble Supreme Court, the relevant authorities have been restrained from granting completion
certificates to the respondent herein since 28.10.2013 till the time, the eco-sensitive zone is
prescribed by the notification issue by the MoEF and consequent clearance is granted by the
National Board of Wildlife. In view of the above, the respondent had to slow down the construction
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139157900/ 13Mis Milan Bansal vs Jaypee Infratech Pvt Ltd on 14 September, 2022
the construction and only when the said embargo has been removed, the construction has been
resumed at its usual pace. Further till the completion certificate is granted to the respondents herein
possession of said flat cannot be handed over to the complainant herein. In view of the same, the
instant complaint is clearly devoid of any merit and is liable to be dismissed.
The aforesaid orders were in force from 14.8.2013 to 11.12.2015 (vide which the restrained in issuing
completion certificates was removed due to notification of eco-sensitive zone of Okhla Bird
Sanctuary being issued by MoEF on 19.8.2015) which compelled the respondent to go slow on
construction due to total uncertainty in the mind of both the developer and the allottees. Despite the
aforesaid embargoand adverse conditions the respondents continued with the construction of the
project including the apartments and tried to complete the project to the best of its abilities and has
also completed the following infrastructure in Jaypee GeensWishtown, Noida:
Around 6000 apartments A 500 bedded hospital Higher Secondary School Golf course 18 holes and
9 hole, shopping complex All internal roads, electric, power back-up, water supply, sewer lines
Security infrastructure Temporary club and Parks.
It is stated that possession of the about 6000 apartments/units in the Jaypee Wishtown Project has
been offered after the completion certificates were received from the Noida Authority. The
respondents have already invested substantial sum of money in developing the infrastructure of the
project as was informed in the brochure and in construction of various towers which are nearing
completion.
Even otherwise, the respondents are duly paying delay compensation to the allottees who had been
paying the demand raised on them as per the payment plan in terms of clause 7.2 of the standard
terms and conditions and therefore, the prayers made in the instant complaint are clearly untenable
as the complainant therein is trying to extort money towards excess interest beyond the agreed
terms of the contract executed between the parties. Further, as has been established herein above,
there is no fault on the part of the respondent herein and he delay has been only due to the orders
passed by the National Green Tribunal subsequently affirmed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as well
as other factors not attributable to the respondent herein and therefore, the respondent cannot be
directed to pay any compensation to the complainant herein.
In view of the above, it is submitted that the respondents are making their full endeavour to
complete the construction of the said project at the earliest. However, if the complainant seeks to
cancel the provisional allotment avail refund the same can only be done in terms of clause 9.1.5(b) of
the standard terms and conditions. Clause 9.1.5 of the standard terms and conditions as agreed by
the complainant provides that:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139157900/ 14Mis Milan Bansal vs Jaypee Infratech Pvt Ltd on 14 September, 2022
"9.1.5 (a) The applicant/allottee shall be entitled to cancel the provisional allotment only on default
of the company/JIL to deliver up the said premises on payment of full consideration and other dues
in accordance with the terms herein and provisional allotment letter. In such an event and upon the
request of the applicant/allottee, the JIL shall refund without any interest or compensation
whatsoever, the entire amount including Earnest Money as had been received from the
applicant/allottee.
(b) If the application/allottee for any other reason requests the company to cancel this provisional
allotment in his favour, the company may in its sole discretion permit such cancellation provided
that the applicant/allottee compensates the company/JIL for any loss caused on account of
substituting another applicant/allotte in his/its/her place and stead ("Termination Charge"). The
Termination Charge shall not include Earnest Money. In such cases, the Earnest money shall not be
refunded.
(c) Notwithstanding anything stated hereinabove, in the event the provisional allotment is
terminated by the company under the terms of clauses 5.5 or clause 9.1.5(b) herein the entire
amount of earnest money shall be forfeited by JIL. The balance installments paid by the applicant in
accordance with the terms hereof shall first be used to satisfy the termination charge, which shall
include land in any event not be less than the interest amounts setforth in clause l5.6 herein and the
rest of the payments shall be refunded to the applicant without interest."
It is submitted that respondent values the satisfaction of all its allottees immensely and therefore, at
all times, respondents has been ready to provide all the necessary help and assistance to the
complainant in a completely professional manner. Accordingly, respondents are committed to
provide possession of the said unit to the complainant at the earliest and the delay caused was only
due to reasons beyond the control of the respondents.
In view of above, it is evident that the respondents have always acted in a bonafide manner and have
acted in a professional and efficient manner keeping the best interests of its consumer in sight. It is
therefore, incorrect to allege that the respondent has committed any deficiency in service. On the
other hand, it is the complainant who has filed the instant complaint as an afterthought, raising
completely false and specious allegations in order to launch a malicious prosecution against the
respondent herein and to extort illegal benefits on the basis of the same. Such illegal design of the
complainant is clearly an abuse of the process of law and is liable to be rejected.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139157900/ 15Mis Milan Bansal vs Jaypee Infratech Pvt Ltd on 14 September, 2022
It is also denied that the respondent have committed any deficiency in service. Therefore, it is also
denied that this Hon'ble Commission cannot award compensation damages or punitive damages
against the respondents.
Further, it is submitted that respondents have taken all the required permissions from the
concerned authorities in relation to the construction of the said sub project. Therefore, it is denied
that the respondents influenced the mind of the complainant. The construction of the said project
got slowed due to force majeure events which are beyond the control of the respondents and not for
any reason attributable to the respondents and therefore, the respondents are entitled for extension
of time without incurring any liability as per clause 7.1 of the standard terms and conditions duly
signed and agreed by the complainant.
The complainant with her free will and after making her independent enquiry and making herself
completely aware about the said sub-project of the respondents, booked the said apartment unit
subject to standard terms and conditions duly signed by her. Further it is submitted that
respondents have taken all the required permissions form the concerned authorities in relation to
the construction of the said sub-project and the said sub-project is approved by all the government
authorities, banks and financial institutions for all kind of loan facilities and no misrepresentation
was made by the respondents to the complainant herein.
It is submitted that the possession of the said unit could not be delivered in time due to force
majeure events which are beyond the control of respondents and the complainant had agreed for
extension of time in case of force majure events hampering the construction of the said sub-project.
Further, it is submitted that timely payment of consideration as per the standard terms and
conditions is the prerequisite of the contract and the complainants had agreed to the same at the
time of making application form.
It is submitted that the complainant has not claimed the possession of the subject unit in the instant
complaint and has only claimed the refund of amount paid by her alongwith interest and
compensation towards the rent, compensation, damages in addition to the punitive damages with
the cost of the case at exorbitant rates. Thus, it is crystal clear that the complainant is not interested
in taking possession of the subject unit rather he wants to claim damages to generate profit only.

We have heard ld. Counsel for the complainant Mr. Piyush Mani Tripathi and ld. Counsel for the
Opposite Parties Mr. Pratul Pratap Singh. We perused the pleadings, evidence and documents on
record.
This case has been filed under Consumer Protection Act 1986. First we have to see the aim and
object of the Consumer Protection Act.
This Consumer Protection Act covers entire goods and services of all sectors that are public, private,
or cooperative sectors, except those exempted by the central government. The act provides a floor
for a consumer where one can file their complaint against the product and the forum takes an action
against the concerned supplier and compensation is granted to the consumer for the inconvenience
he/she has encountered. The main objects of the consumer protection act are ;
To Provide better and all round protection to consumer.
To Provide machinery for the speedy redressal of the grievances.
To Create framework for consumers to seek redressal.
To Provide rights to consumers.
To Safeguarde rights of Consumers.
Let us know more about the rights and responsiblities of consumer . Listed below are the Rights of
the Consumer Right to Safety- Before buying, a consumer can examine on the quality and guarantee
of the goods and opt for ISI or AGMARK products.
Right to Choose- Consumer must have the right to choose from a variety and number of goods and
in a competitive price Right to be informed- The buyers must be provided with complete
information with all the necessary and adequate details of the product, make her/him act wise, and

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139157900/ 17Mis Milan Bansal vs Jaypee Infratech Pvt Ltd on 14 September, 2022
Listed below the responsibilities of the consumers Responsibility to be aware - A consumer has to be
careful of the safety and quality of products and services before purchasing.
Responsibility to think independently- Consumer should be well bothered about what they want and
need and hence make independent choices.
Responsibility to speak out- The buyer should be fearless to speak out their problems and tell to
traders what they exactly want Responsibility to complain- It becomes the consumer's responsibility
to express and file a complaint about their dissatisfaction with goods or services in a sincere and fair
manner.
Responsibility to be an Ethical Consumer- Consumer must be fair and not engage themselves with
any deceptive practice.
The Consumer Protection Act 1986 was enacted to provide for better protection of the interests of
consumers and for that purpose to make provision for the establishment of Consumers Councils and
other authorities for the settlement of consumers' disputes and for matters connected therewith
(Preamble).
The Act Inter alia, seeks to promote and protect the rights of consumers such as --
right to be protected against marketing of goods which are hazardous to life and property;
(2) right to be informed about the quality, quantity, potency, purity, standard and price of goods to
protect the consumer against unfair trade practices;
(3) right to be assured, wherever possible, access to variety of goods at competitive prices;
(4) right to be heard and to assured that customers' interests will receive due consideration at
appropriate forums.
(5) Right to seek redressal against unfair practices or unscrupulous exploitation of consumers; and
(6) Right to consumer education The objects are sought to be promoted and protected by the
Consumer Protection Councils to be established at the Central and State levels.
The Act applies to all goods and services, except if otherwise provided by the Central Government by
Notification. To provide speedy and simple redressal of consumer disputes, a quasi judicial
machinery is set up at the District, State and Central levels. The three tier system of quasi judicial
bodies will observe the principle of natural justice and are empowered to give relief of a specific
nature and to award, wherever appropriate, compensation to consumers. Penalties for
non-compliance of the orders given by the quasi judicial bodies have also been provided.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139157900/ 18Mis Milan Bansal vs Jaypee Infratech Pvt Ltd on 14 September, 2022
Thus the Consumer Protection Act is to serve the interests of the consumers. Consumer education
and redressal of consumers' grievances are the two aspects of the Act. It makes good the loss a
consumer suffers and increases the feeling of responsibility of the manufacturer, trader, supplier or
businessman.
The provisions of the Act have to be construed in favor of the consumer to achieve the purpose of
enactment as it is social benefit oriented legislation. The primary duty of the Court while construing
the provisions of such an Act is to adopt a constructive approach subject to that it should not do
violence to the language of the provisions and not contrary to attempted objective of the enactment.
Extent of Consumer Protection:
While other legislations may be either punitive or preventive, the Consumer Protection Act
compensates the consumer. The provisions of the Act are in addition to and not in derogation of the
provisions of any law at the time being in force (Sec 3). In Maine Container Services South Pvt Ltd v
Go Garments 1998 (3) SCC 247 it has been held that the Contract Act applies to all litigants before
the Commissioner under the Consumers Protection Act. Passengers traveling in train suffering
injuries and loss of Jewelry as a result of assault by unruly crowd are eligible for filing of complaint
before State Commission is maintainable notwithstanding the provisions of sections 100 and 103 of
Railways Act, 1889. The Consumer Protection Act therefore gives the consumer an additional
remedy besides those which may be available under other existing laws. Existence of an arbitration
clause in the agreement is no bar to the entertainment of complaint by the Redressal Agency as the
remedy under the Act is in addition to the provisions of any other law. However, the Consumer
Forums under the Act have not taken over the jurisdiction of civil Courts. If the dispute between the
parties is pending in Civil Court no Consumer Forum will adjudicate the dispute. Similarly if
evidence be laid by the parties to the dispute is voluminous or complicated the parties will be
referred to the appropriate Civil Court.
Consumers Protection Act, thus enshrines the rights of a consumer to be informed about the quality,
quantity, potency, price etc., of the goods to be protected against unfair trade practices, to seek
inexpensive and expeditious redressal of grievances before the Consumer Forums. Consumer
Protection Act is a benevolent piece of legislation to protect a large body of consumers from
exploitation.
With the passage of time, the populace of the country is on hike and so are their opinions. Their
opinion forms the basis for their interpretation, it may be a good or a bad interpretation. What
would happen in the situation where people starting interpreting the laws? We might be flooded
with several interpretations. The interpretations will be in such huge number that the laws will
become unclear. This is the reason why lawmakers, while making the law, formulate it in accordance
with the aim, set out by them, before penning down the legislations. The aim of any legislation
defines the basis of the act. It becomes the ground norm of the act, based upon which the judiciary
interprets the disputed texts.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139157900/ 19Mis Milan Bansal vs Jaypee Infratech Pvt Ltd on 14 September, 2022
The aim of any act forms the indispensable element, because it acts as the cord that delivers the real
intention of the legislators behind the act. Whenever there is clash between two legislations, it is the
aim of the legislation which makes the judges to derive at the endpoint in deciding which law has the
superseding effect. It is through the doctrine of pith and substance that judges are able to derive at
the major inclination towards one act over another act. This inclination is decided on the basis of the
aim/goal of the act and the facts of that particular case.
Now the next question is regarding Arbitration Clause no 10.9 in the agreed terms and conditions
for. It is argued by the opposite party that the matter should have been referred to an arbitrator. As
far as Arbitration Act and Consumer Protection Act are concerned the following article and case
laws will help to understand the dominance of the act.
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ARBITRATION ACT AND CPA In India, people are least aware with
the consumer's rights and lags behind having low general understanding of arbitration as dispute
resolution mechanism. The arbitration clause can curtail the grounds on which the consumers can
raise the disputes, whereas on the other side the consumer protection act may grant the consumer
various grounds on which he can file the complaint which may not be otherwise permitted in the
standard form agreement having the arbitration clause.
Arbitration has equal bargaining powers and the resources at hand which makes it private,
efficacious, and timely form of dispute resolution. Whereas in case of consumer disputes, the case is
different, where they are exposed to the standard form agreements making them submit to the
unfair or the repressive terms. They are several times made part of the one-sided arbitration clause,
which is drafted keeping in mind the interest of one party only.
These days Indians are shifting to the online purchasing platform and being ignorant of not
checking the agreements which makes them to be covered under the blanket provision and end up
being the party to the arbitration. This makes less options opened for the consumer to resort to the
statutory remedies which in turns endangers the interest of the consumers. This may also build the
hostile market against the e-commerce in India. It may have the adverse effect not only on the
Indian economy but also on the e-commerce giants who aims at invest in the growing market.

CONSUMER COURT AS A SPECIAL COURT It was held in the case of Aftab Singh v Emaar MGF
Land Limited &Anr., that the provisions of the arbitration act does not apply to the consumer
courts, as they are the special courts set up for the public purpose. In this case, the group of the
home owners filed the complaint against Emaar MGF Land Private Limited (Builder) before
NCDRC. The complaint was filed for the non-delivering the plots to the buyers as per the Buyers'
Agreement. The builder filed the application under section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
on the basis of the arbitration agreement made between the parties which was mentioned there in
the Buyer's Agreement.
It was argued by the petitioner that the remedies provided under the Consumer Protection Act are
not in exclusion of the existing laws, but are in addition to it, which has been sated in the case
of National Seed Corporation Limited v M. MadhusudhanReddy( (2012) 2 SCC 506 ) . It was also
argued that the consumer protection act is the piece of the legislation which intends to confer the
benefits and it is the, for which the purpose should be advanced. Therefore, regardless of having
entered into the arbitration clause, the consumer can invoke the section 3 of the Consumer
Protection Act and bring the complaint to the consumer forum( Skypak Couriers Ltd. Vs. Tata
Chemicals Ltd)[3].
The builder pleaded that the Consumer Courts act as the 'judicial authority' within the scope of
section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act and therefore if there is any valid clause entered
between the parties, then the consumer courts can refer the parties to the arbitration. And hence
according to the act the consumer courts are obliged to bring the case for the arbitration,
irrespective of the High Court and Supreme Court decisions. The NCRDC's full bench ruled that the
arbitration act does not bars the consumer court's jurisdiction relying on the Supreme Court's
judgement in the case of Booz Allen Hamilton Inc v. SBI Home Finance Ltd(2011) 5 SCC 532), which
provided the country with the disputes that are not arbitrable. In this case, Supreme Court, came
with the 7 categories of the disputes that are not arbitrable[5].
The commission also relied on the Supreme Court judgement in the case of A. Ayyasamy v. A
Paramasivam(2016)10 SCC 386 ;N. Radhakrishnan v. Maestro Engineers) that the dispute will not
be arbitrable if the civil court's jurisdiction has been exclusively given to a tribunal or the special
court. The Consumer Courts were made to create an organized system for dispute between the
people who possess the unequal power i.e. the consumer and the large corporations. The
commission also pointed out the section 2(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act which refers to
the situations where the special categories of disputes are protected from being referred to the
arbitration. Therefore this provision protects the Consumer disputes. The court concluded that if the
court allows party to go for the arbitration and being in favor of the builder, it will defeat the goals
and the main purpose of the Consumer Protection Act.

THE CONDITIONS PRIOR AND POST 2015 AMENDMENT TO SECTION 8 OF ARBITRATION
AND CONCILIATION ACT Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act states that the judicial
authority can instruct the parties to go for arbitration in the case when there exists the arbitration
clause in the arbitration agreement. It does not bars oust the jurisdiction of the Consumer Court, it
will continue to hold and enjoy the jurisdiction irrespective of presence of an arbitration clause in
the agreement.
The Supreme Court contented that there was no legislative intent of the amended provisions of the
section 8(1) in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, so as to override the other statutes which have
the specific remedies. Neither it intends to make disputes related to trusts, criminal law, tenancy,
telecom, family law, IPR, etc, as the arbitrable subject and to against the judgement of A Ayyasamy v
A Parasivam&Ors(2016) 10 SCC 729 ) and Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. v SBI Home Finance Limited
&Ors.(2011) 5 SCC 532 ) Supreme Court analyzed the situations prior to 2015 Amendment, related
to referring the consumer disputes to arbitration. Supreme Court referred to the judgmentsprior
2015 which had the settled law in cases of Fair Air Engineering Pvt. Ltd &Anr V N K Modi (1996) 6
the SCC 385), National Seeds Corporation Limited v Madhusudhan Reddy &Anr (2012) 2 SCC 506)
and Rosedale Developers Private Limited V Aghor Bhattacharya &Ors (2018) 11 SCC 337). These
cases held that even if the dispute arise from the contract having the arbitration clause, it will not
impede the parties to resort to file a complaint before the consumer forum under Consumer
Protection Act. All of the judgements had the rationale that provision of section 3 of Consumer
Protection Act states that "the provision is in addition to, and not in the derogation of any other law
for the time being in force."
The Supreme Court acknowledged the 2015 amendment which restricted the power of any judicial
authority to refuse to refer the dispute to arbitration under section 8(1) and appointment of
arbitrator under section 11(6A) and also acknowledged the fact that it invalidated the earlier
precedent in the case of Sukanya Holding (P) Ltd v Jayesh H Pandya &Anr.( 2003) 5 SCC 531)
Supreme Court considering section 2(3) of the arbitration act, states that the Part I of the arbitration
act shall not affect any other law for the time being in force, by virtue of which certain disputes may
not be submitted to the arbitration. Supreme Court stated that the legislative intent of 2015
Amendment was never to override section 2(3) of the Arbitration Act and other statute which offers
the public remedy like that of CPA.The Supreme Court in 1994 already held that CPA is a beneficial
legislation which provides the economical and expeditious remedies to the aggrieved consumer in
the case of Lucknow Development Act V M K Gupta(1994) 1 SCC 243).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139157900/ 22Mis Milan Bansal vs Jaypee Infratech Pvt Ltd on 14 September, 2022
Referring to all of the above cases, the Supreme Court in this case affirmed that the decision given
by NCDRC is valid and stated that the consumer dispute are the subject matter where the dispute
cannot be referred to arbitration as it pertains to rights in rem (public rights). It comes under the
ambit of the non-arbitrable dispute defined under Booz Allen and Ayyasamy case. The disputes are
non-arbitrable in disputes related to criminal laws, tenancy, trusts, family law, telecom, IPR,
insolvency and winding up, and in certain cases, fraud.
CONCLUSION AND CRITICS OF THE CASE It can be ensured with the judgement that consumers
who have lesser bargaining power than that of the service providers shall not be pushed towards the
relatively cumbersome process of the arbitration where there can be other more affordable and
efficacious low public law remedies available. The CPA is a special legislation which has the public
law remedies dealing with the rights under the umbrella of "right in rem" which has been espoused
by Booz Allen. The case had many critics for it, as it was delivered during the course of time, when
India has been continuously focusing upon the survival and the supremacy of the arbitration
proceeding over litigation in the Indian dispute resolution. And it was the major reason that it
appeared for some of the people as a diversion from the object of Indian arbitration system to be an
arbitration-friendly hub. This also draws our attention towards the fact that the arbitration shall be
made a more consumer-friendly method of dispute resolution. It is because of this judgement that
people were able to depict the heightened element of the public interest consumer dispute in India.
[1]Review Petition (C) Nos. 2629-2630 of 2018 in Civil Appeal Nos. 23512-23513 of 2017 [2](2012) 2

506 [11](2018) 11 SCC 337 [12](2003) 5 SCC 531 [13](1994) 1 SCC 243 So it is clear that The
Consumer Protection Act is a special type of act and even if there is a clause of arbitrator in the
application form, it will not oust the jurisdiction of the consumer courts. So this court has
jurisdiction to try the case.
It is also clear that the complainant has deposited a good amount of money towards this flat. In the
provisional allotment letter dtd 16.04.2012 the opposite party has promised to deliver the
possession of the said within 42 months meaning thereby that the possession was to be given by 15
October 2015. The opposite party failed to honour his promise. Now the opposite party has brought
the story of Yamuna Express way, story of Jayprakash associates and infratecetcetc .Provisional
allotment letter dtd 16.04.2012 has been issued jointly by Jaiprakash Associates Ltd and Jaypee
Infra Tech Ltd , meaning thereby that both the firm jointly and severally liable for this transaction.
Now the story of moratorium etc in relation to Jaypee Infra Tech Ltd has nothing to do with this
joint responsibility. Jaiprakash Infratech Ltd has issued the receipts of deposits so he has collected
the money from the complainant and if Jaiprakash Infratech Ltd comes in picture and collect
money, the matter rates between those two individuals and not between complainant and opposite
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139157900/ 23Mis Milan Bansal vs Jaypee Infratech Pvt Ltd on 14 September, 2022
parties.
In the light of above mentioned facts we have to see the latest judicial pronouncement of Hon'ble
NCDRC in First Appeal no 380 of 2019 , Judgement dated 26.09.22 Jaiprakash associates Ltd Vs
Deepti Kumar & two ors. In this case the matter rates to " Garden Isles" and in the present case the
matter also relates to " Garden Isles" . Both these Isles are same and situated in JP Greens .Soit is
clear that the Hon'ble NCDRC has dealt with one of the same matter and pronounced its judgement
which is very important in the present circumstances of the case. The Hon'ble NCDRC has held in

Now it has been held that the opposite parties are liable for the compensation and damages. The
opposite parties totally failed to carry out their promise and the complainant cannot be left /for long
period. There is clear deficiency of service on the part of the opposite parties and it is a matter of
unfair trade practice and unfair contract. What should be the amount of compensation and what
should be the rate of interest, will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case as held by on
the Supreme Court in the following judgement, Hon'ble Supreme Court has held in Ghaziabad
Development Authority Vs Balbir Singh (2004) 4 SCC 65-
"The Supreme Court, at the outset, reiterated the position taken in the case of Lucknow
Development Authority v. M.K. Gupta, and held that "the Consumer Protection Act has a wide reach
and the Commission has jurisdiction even in cases of service rendered by statutory and public
authorities". It further held that the power of the NCDRC extends to awarding compensation to
consumers for misfeasance in the public office i.e. an act which is oppressive or capricious or
arbitrary or negligent provided loss or injury is suffered by a citizen. Therefore, it upheld the appeals
filed before it to the extent that it confirmed the jurisdiction of the NCDRC to award compensation
in cases of service rendered by statutory & public authorities (the land development authorities in
the present case).
As to the issue of whether the grant of interest at the rate of 18% per annum by the NCDRC in all
cases is justifiable, the Supreme Court held in the negative. It stated that "the power to and duty to
award compensation does not mean that irrespective of facts of the case compensation can be
awarded in all matters at a uniform rate of 18% per annum." It held it to be unsustainable. The
Court further stated that the "Award of compensation must be under different separate heads and
must vary from case to case depending on the facts of each case." The purpose of awarding
compensation is to recompense for a loss or injury suffered and such compensation would therefore
be proportional to the amount of loss and injury.
While considering the compensation to be awarded to the consumers in cases of deficiency of service
by Development Authorities, the Court laid down a range of principles for the determination of the
amount of compensation, summarised below:
To award compensation, the Forum or the Commission must determine that service has been
deficient and/or misfeasance in public office which has resulted in loss or injury. While no hard and
fast rule can be laid down, the Court gave a few instances where the award of compensation would
be justifiable, including where possession is not handed over within the intimated period even
though allotment is made and the price is paid. In such cases, the loss could be determined based on
loss of rent which could have been earned if possession was given. Compensation could also be the
scheme has been canceled without any justifiable cause, after the allotment.

Compensation cannot be uniform and to illustrate this, the Court lays down the principle to be
followed for the determination of compensation in two cases- - (a) where the delivery of possession
is being directed, and (b) where only the monies are directed to be returned or refunded by the
Court. In case (a), the compensation for harassment will necessarily have to be less since in a way
the aggrieved party is being compensated by an increase in the value of the property he is getting. In
case (b) however, the party is suffering a greater loss since he has been deprived of the flat/plot, and
his expectation of delivery of possession. He would also be denied the benefit of an increase in the
value of land and the compensation thereof. Therefore, the compensation to be awarded in such
cases would have to be higher than in case (a).
The Court held that "such compensation has to be worked out after looking into the facts of each
case and after determining what is the amount of harassment/loss which has been caused to the
consumer."
Compensation would include compensation for physical, mental, or even emotional suffering, insult,
or injury or loss."
"The consumer protection laws have a wide reach and the consumers are entitled to receive
compensation for deficiency in services rendered by statutory and public authorities. The Consumer
Commissions have been vested with the jurisdiction to award the value of goods or services and
compensation. On being satisfied that a complainant is entitled to compensation for loss or injury or
harassment or mental agony or oppression, it must direct the authority to pay compensation. A wide
discretion has been given to determine the quantum of compensation for any loss or damage
suffered by a consumer, to redress any injustice. However, it is a well-established principle that the
computation of compensation has to be fair, reasonable, and must reconcile with the loss or injury
suffered. The Consumer Forum is cast with the duty to take into account all relevant factors for
arriving at the compensation to be paid.
This landmark decision has set a precedent on the matter of compensation to be awarded in matters
relating to allotment of land by development authorities and has been relied upon in many
subsequent cases of the Supreme Court. In the case of H. P. Housing Board v Varinder Kumar
Garg[(2005) 9 SCC 430] and Haryana Urban Development Authority vs Darsh Kumar[(2005) 9 SCC
449], the Supreme Court directed the Commission to follow the principles laid down in the case
of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh in future cases."
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Haryana Urban Development ... vs Darsh Kumar, Etc. Etc ,
Civil Appeal no 5796 of 2002 decided on on 28 July, 2004 has held ;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139157900/ 28Mis Milan Bansal vs Jaypee Infratech Pvt Ltd on 14 September, 2022
"This Court has, in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir Singh reported in
(2004) 5 SCC 65, deprecated this practice. This Court has held that interest at the rate of 18% cannot
be granted in all cases irrespective of the facts of the case. This Court has held that the Consumer
Forums could grant damages/compensation for mental agony/harassment where it finds
misfeasance in public office. This Court has held that such compensation is a recompense for the
loss or injury and it necessarily has to be based on a finding of loss or injury and must co-relate with
the amount of loss or injury. This Court has held that the Forum or the Commission thus had to
determine that there was deficiency in service and/or misfeasance in public office and that it has
resulted in loss or injury. This Court has also laid down certain other guidelines which the Forum or
the Commission has to follow in future cases.
We are informed that in spite of there being no stay, to payment of interest beyond 12% and in spite
of clarification given by this Court's order (reported in (2004) 5 SCC 65), the amounts have still not
been paid. We feel that for the lapse Appellants must pay interest at the rate of 15% from 17th
March, 2004 till payment. Appellants shall also pay costs fixed at Rs.500/- in each case to the Legal
Aid Society of the Supreme Court. The Appellants must recover the amount paid towards costs
personally from the officer/s, who were responsible for not paying even after clarification by this
Court. We clarify that this Order shall not be taken as a precedent in any other matter as the order
has been passed taking special features of the case into account. The Forum/Commission will follow
the principles laid down by this Court in the case of Ghaziabad Development Authority vs. Balbir
Singh (supra) in future cases. The Appeals are disposed off in above terms. There will be no order as
to costs."
So it is clear that the compensation and rate of interest shall depend on the facts and circumstances
of each case and no hard and fast rule can be framed. In this connection some of the judgement of
the Supreme Court and Hon'ble NCDRC should be taken into account.

The Hon'ble NCDRC held that:
"Brief facts of the cases are that opposite parties/respondents are engaged in the activity of housing
construction and accordingly they have launched a project named as Parsvnath Planet situated in
Gomti Nagar, Lucknow. The project was demonstrated to be very lucrative and made attractive to
the vendees, in order to procure/collect money from the needy persons demonstrating themselves to
be excellence in the field of construction activity as compared to other builders and assured the
buyers/complainants that it has been duly approved by the Lucknow Development Authority and
necessary permission has also been obtained from them. The emphasis was made by the opposite
parties that the possession of the Unit shall be given within a scheduled period of 36+6=42 months
stipulated in agreements executed in between the parties for the project launched in the year 2006.
The complainants/appellants attracted by the promise and assurance of the opposite parties,
somehow managed and arranged the money from their personal sources as well as on loan at
attractive rate of interest and the hard earned money was paid by them to the opposite parties in a
hope that the possession of the units shall be provided to them in the year 2009 and they can leave
peacefully in their own houses, since the complainants are living in rented houses.
The complainants visited the construction site of the opposite parties after depositing the entire
amount, where it was revealed that the construction activities were on halt and the persons available
on the site told the complainants that the apartments are likely to be completed till 2015. Even the
partial construction done by the opposite parties was defective and did not match the specifications
provided in the agreement. The complainants were shocked on hearing it and observing the site. The
complainants immediately contacted the Area Manager, who told the complainants that there is
some delay in the construction of the apartment and the apartments shall be ready till June, 2010.
The complainants have to repay the amount taken on loan alongwith interest without getting the
possession of the allotted units causing irreparable loss and injury to them. The complainants have
come to know that the opposite parties have invested the funds earmarked for this project into their
other projects in other city due to which they have not been able to complete the project in time.
Besides this, it has also come to the light that although the opposite parties had collected huge funds
from the buyers but in spite of that the opposite parties have miserably failed to pay the dues of
Lucknow Development Authority which forced the Lucknow Development Authority to issue
coercive measures against the opposite parties for the recovery of their dues. Alleging deficiency on
the part of opposite parties/ respondents, complainants filed separate complaints before State
Commission. Aggrieved by the order of Hon'ble State Commission, these appeals preferred
before Hon'ble National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.
Hon'ble NCDRC discussed various case laws and after hearing the parties held, "Learned
Counsel for appellants submitted that as complainants have been deprived of possession for a long
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139157900/ 30Mis Milan Bansal vs Jaypee Infratech Pvt Ltd on 14 September, 2022
period beyond agreed period, it amounts to restrictive trade practice under Section 2 (nnn) of
Consumer Protection Act and complainants are entitled to get compensation. Section 2 (nnn) runs
as under:- means a trade practice which tends to bring about restrictive trade practice manipulation
of price or its conditions of delivery or to affect flow of supplies in the market relating to goods or
services in such a manner as to impose on the consumers unjustified costs or restrictions and shall
include- Delay beyond the period agreed to by a trader in supply of such goods or in providing the
services which has led or is likely to lead to rise in the price; Any trade practice which requires a
consumer to buy, hire or avail of any goods, or, as the case may be, services as condition precedent
to buying, hiring or availing of other goods or services; Perusal of aforesaid provision reveals that
when opposite party delays in delivery of goods which leads to rise in the price of goods meaning
thereby, more price is charged from complainant, it amounts to restrictive trade practice. In the case
in hand, opposite party on account of delayed delivery of possession is not charging higher rate than
the agreed rate for delivery of possession of flat, so, it does not fall within the purview of restrictive
trade practice under Section 2(nnn) of Consumer Protection Act. "
"Admittedly, agreements were executed in 2006 and as per agreements, possession of flats was to be
delivered within 42 months, meaning thereby, possession was to be given in the year 2009-2010
and possession has not been handed over so far though year 2016 has started. No doubt,
complainants are entitled to get penalty amount for delayed delivery of possession as per clause 10 (
c) of the agreement but opposite party cannot be permitted to avail benefit of aforesaid clause for
indefinite period. This penalty clause should be allowed for the benefit of parties for a limited period
and in the cases in hand, I deem it appropriate to extend applicability of aforesaid clause for a
period of one year beyond 42 months and after that, complainants are certainly entitled to
compensation. Opposite party cannot be allowed to avail huge funds of complainants by paying
merely Rs. 5/- per sq. ft. for example, complainants who have purchased flat measuring 164.901 sq.
mtr., they have made payment of about Rs. 31.00 to 32 lakhs and in the garb of clause 10 (c),
opposite party is paying penalty @ approximately Rs. 9,000/- per month against enjoying funds
more than Rs. 30.00 lakhs. As complainants have been deprived to shift to their flats for a long
period which would not only have given them satisfaction of living in their own house but also have
raised their social status and opposite party has enjoyed funds of complainants for a long period, I
deem it appropriate to allow compensation @ Rs. 15,000/- p.m. to the complainants who have
applied for flats upto 175 sq. mtr and Rs. 20,000/- per month to complainants who have applied for
flats above 175 sq. after 54 months of execution of agreement till delivery of possession. "
Against this judgment, parties went to Hon'ble Supreme Court. The judgment of Hon'ble Supreme
Court is:-

In Nalin Bhargava vs. Parsvnath Developers Ltd. CA 6662/2018 @ SLP(C) 7596/2016 etc and
other related civil appeals on 13 July, 2018, Hon'ble Supreme Court held:-
"Leave granted in all the special leave petitions.CA 6662/2018 @ SLP(C) 7596/2016 etc.
It is submitted by Mr. M.L. Lahoty, learned counsel appearing for the appellants in all the appeals
that the possession has been handed over and the deficiencies have been removed and, therefore, he
has no grievance. However, Mr. Lahoty would insist that there should be imposition of costs as
compensation.
Mr. Sachin Datta, learned senior counsel appearing for the developer has raised objections with
regard to imposition of costs.
Having heard learned counsel for the parties, we are of the considered opinion that the cause of
justice would be best subserved if each of the appellants in the present appeals are given
Rs.1,50,000/- (Rupees one lakh fifty thousand only) per flat, towards costs. When we say "cost", we
mean costs alone and nothing else."
These builders are just earning money from the consumers to whom they issued allotment letters
and got a huge amount. They keep this amount for a long time and earn interest on it. Property
dealing is that part of business where they never pay a penny to the consumers on their amounts
deposited for a long-term or if they pay, they pay a meagre interest of about 5% or so but they charge
18 to 24% or more if the consumers default in depositing any instalment. It reminds us the story of
"The Merchant of Venice" The Merchant of Venice is the story of a Jewish money lender Shylock
who demands that an antisemitic Christian offer "a pound of flesh" as collateral against a
loan. These acts of builders also remind us the age of Sahukari during ancient India and also during
British Raj. Whether these builders have power to frame their own law? They put their terms and
conditions in such a way that the sufferer will always be the consumer. The Consumer Protection Act
1986 has been enacted for the benefits of consumers, so the courts dealing with Consumer
Protection Act 1986 should come forward for their rescue. The courts are not governed by the
builders but they are governed by the law, Custom and Usages. Now in the background of all the
facts and also the facts of the present case, we will also discuss something more.
After taking account the main objects of the Consumer Protection Act, the facts and circumstances
of the present case ,we will decide the amount of compensation and damages for the complainant.
The opposite parties have objected that this flat has been taken by the complainant for the
commercial use. The opposite parties have stated that the complainant did not ask for the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139157900/ 32Mis Milan Bansal vs Jaypee Infratech Pvt Ltd on 14 September, 2022
possession of the flat but he prayed for the refund of his amount which shows that the flat was
booked for commercial purposes and not for personal living . If a person who trusted the opposite
parties and applied for a unit in the year 2012 and he did not get the flat or he was not given any flat
by the opposite parties even after 10 years of the booking of the flat ,in such circumstances he may
think better option to get refund otherwise that may also be not refunded to him. The allottees know
that the builders have higher links that's why they are going and collecting huge amount of money
from the innocent allottees. If the complainant has asked for refund of his money, this will not show
that he does not want the flat. Maybe he has purchased a flat somewhere else and therefore he is
requesting for the refund of his money. If the opposite parties think so, we are inclined to see clause
6 of the relief which is "any other order which this Hon'ble commission may deem fit and proper in
the circumstances of the case may also be passed". So taking into consideration this relief clause
now we are of the opinion that there should be an order for the delivery of possession of the flat with
completion and occupancy certificate and also an order to execute the registry of the flat with
completion certificate, occupancy certificate and NOCs of fire department, civil aviation department,
pollution control Department etc and it should be done within eight weeks from the date of
judgement of this complaint case otherwise after eight weeks the opposite parties shall jointly and
severally liable to pay damages at a rate of (cid:130) 2 lakhs per month till the actual delivery of possession
and execution of sale deed with all the relevant documents as mentioned above. Seeking refund of
money deposited does not prove that this flat has been applied for commercial use or for reselling.
Now we take the facts and circumstances of the present case. In this case the complainant paid (cid:130)
35,14,033/- against the total price of (cid:130) 51,07,355/, so about 70% of the basic cost has already been
paid by the complainant and he did not get the possession of the flat as promised by the opposite
party within the time limit framed by the opposite parties which was 42 months. After considering
all the above-mentioned judgements of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and Hon'ble NCDRC we are of
the opinion that the complainant is entitled for the following reliefs:-
The complainant is entitled to get possession of the flat as allotted provisionally bearing unit
reference number GDI 0240104 situated in"Garden Isles" at Jaypee Greens Noida within eight
weeks from the date of judgement of this complaint case on depositing the rest amount of (cid:130)
51,07,355 / without any interest and if the possession was not delivered to him with completion and
occupancy certificate and NOC's of fire department, civil aviation department, pollution control
Department etc , complainant will be entitled to get (cid:130) 2 lakhsper month after eight weeks from the
date of judgement of this complaint case..
In Alternative The complainant is entitled to get the present market value of the
flat that exist today as per valuer report with interest at a rate of 9% on this amount from 15.10.2015
till the date of actual payment.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/139157900/ 33Mis Milan Bansal vs Jaypee Infratech Pvt Ltd on 14 September, 2022
The complainant is entitled to get (cid:130) 15,000 per month starting from 15.10.2015 till the date of actual
payment with interest at a rate of 10% per annum and it should be paid within eight weeks from the
date of judgement of this complaint case and if not paid within eight weeks from the date of
judgement of this complaint case, the complainant will be entitled for interest at a rate of 15% from
15.10.2015 till the date of actual payment.
The complainant is entitled to damages of (cid:130) 1.5 lakhs as per judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court.
For relief number three we are of the opinion that the complainant is entitled to get (cid:130) 40 lakhs from
the opposite parties within eight weeks from the date of judgement of this complaint case towards
the mental torture, agony, harassment and depression and this amount if not paid within eight
weeks from the date of judgement, the complainant will be entitled to receive interest at a rate of
10% on this amount after eight weeks from the date of judgement of the complaint case.
The complainant is entitled to get (cid:130) 1 lakh towards cost of the case and it shall be paid within eight
weeks from the date of judgement, the complainant will be entitled to receive interest at a rate of
10% on this amount after eight weeks from the date of judgement of the complaint case till the
actual payment.
Therefore the complaint case is allowed accordingly and the following order is being passed .
ORDER The opposite parties are directed jointly and severally to hand over the possession of the
flat as allotted provisionally bearing unit reference number GDI 0240104 situated in "Garden Isles"
at Jaypee Greens Noida within eight weeks from the date of judgement of this complaint case on
