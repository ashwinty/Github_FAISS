BEFORE:

Hon'ble Dr.S.K.Kakade, MEMBER
For the appellant:
Adv.P.R.Ingle
For the Respondent: Adv.Arpita Phansalkar
ORDER
Per Mr.Justice A.P.Bhangale, Hon'ble President [1] By this appeal, appellant has questioned validity
and legality of the impugned judgment and order in consumer complaint no.CC/16/121 dated
29/09/2016 whereby the case of the complainant was partly allowed and opponent was directed to
refund an amount of Rs.85,000/- together with interest @9% p.a. to the complainant with effect
from 25/08/2015 to 25/03/2016. Compensation on account mental harassment in the sum of
Rs.10,000/- and litigation costs in the sum of Rs.5,000/- was also awarded.
[2] Brief facts are that the complainant resident of Mumbai had approached opponent to book
marriage hall for his daughter, Sudestha by depositing an amount of Rs.16,000/-on 25/08/2015.
Marriage was fixed on 20/01/2016. Pursuant to the marriage intended, the complainant had also
deposited certain sums for incidental services such as decoration, food supply etc. at the time of
marriage. There is no dispute that the booking amounts were deposited as mentioned in the tabular
form in the impugned judgment and order.

[3] On behalf of the appellant, it is submitted that learned Forum below did not consider the rulings
cited which were binding upon and erroneously passed award in favour of the complainant.
According to the learned advocate for the appellant, there is no deficiency in service as such as the
appellant was ready and willing to provide services for which amounts were deposited. Further it is
more submitted that refund could not have been allowed pursuant to the terms and conditions
agreed upon between the parties as conditions were printed on the overleaf of the receipt. According
to the appellant, there is no unfair trade practice in any manner and learned Forum below could not
have exercised jurisdiction to entertain the trial of the complaint as, according to the appellant there
was no relationship between the parties as 'consumer' and 'service provider' and as no irreparable
loss is caused so as to compensate the complainant, as the complainant himself had cancelled
booking and appellant could not assign the booking in favour of any other person and no new
booking had taken place on the date fixed. Therefore, it is submitted that complaint ought to have
been dismissed. Further, according to the learned advocate for the appellant, learned Forum below
failed to notice the rulings which are referred as under:-
i. 1994 (3) CPJ (NC 54) - Mukta Kalyan Mandapan V.
N.Radhakrishna ii. 1996 (1) CPR 46 - K. Babu Prasad Reddy vs. Dr.Rajasekhar Reddy iii. 2009 (4)
CPR 227 - Deepak Kumar vs. Sahraz Husain iv. First Appeal No.FA/2010/317 - decided by State
Commission, Chennai - P.C.Murugesan vs. c. Padmavathi.
[4] Further, according to the advocate for the appellant, rulings which were cited by or on behalf of
the respondent/complainant were not applicable to the facts and circumstances, therefore, could
not have been considered by the learned District Forum. According to the appellant, the issue as to
whether refund should have to be allowed or not did not fall within the scope of Consumer
Protection Act, 1986. On these grounds, therefore, is submitted that there is no deficiency in service
as such.
[5] On the other hand, on behalf of respondent it is contended that receipts were issued in favour of
the complainant separately as under:-
i. Receipt No.012 dated 25/08/2015 for booking Ram Mangal Sanskrutik Bhavan for Shubha
Mangal Hall in the sum of Rs.16,000/-.
ii. Receipt No.013 dated 25/08/2015 was issued for Rs.16,000/- in the name of Yash Decorators.
iii. Receipt No.012 dated 25/08/2015 in the name of Swapn Sajavat Decorators in the sum of
Rs.16,000/- for decoration, chairs, Pooja material etc. iv. Receipt No.013 dated 25/08/2015 was
issued by Ram Mangal Sanskrutik Bhavan in the sum of Rs.5,000/- as deposit.
v. Cash/Credit Memo dated 25/08/2015 was issued in the sum of Rs.16,000/- for marriage hall
decoration.

vi. Receipt No.013 dated 25/08/2015 was issued in the sum of Rs.16,000/- by Ram Mangal
Sanskrutik Bhavan for Swapna Mangal Dinning Hall.
[6] Our attention is also invited to the hand written document dated 25/08/2015 whereby amount
mentioned as hall rent was in the sum of Rs.1,16,000/- whereby according to the appellant,
complainant had mentioned in Marathi as under :-
"(cid:128)(cid:129)(cid:130)(cid:131) (cid:132)(cid:133)(cid:134)(cid:135), (cid:136)(cid:137) (cid:138)(cid:137) (cid:139) 20/01/2016 ; (cid:140) (cid:129)(cid:132)(cid:141)(cid:142) ; (cid:138)(cid:143)(cid:140)(cid:144)(cid:141)(cid:145)(cid:146) - 1,16,000/- (cid:140) (cid:129)(cid:132)(cid:141)(cid:142)(cid:141)(cid:132)(cid:147) (cid:139)(cid:141) (cid:148)(cid:137)

These contents were signed on 25/08/2015 and on the same document on 01/11/2015, following
endorsement was made:-
"20/01/2016 (cid:138) (cid:139)(cid:141)(cid:147) (cid:150) (cid:158)(cid:139)(cid:147)(cid:141)(cid:130)(cid:129)(cid:141) (cid:148)(cid:137) (cid:132)(cid:130) (cid:149)(cid:153)(cid:141)(cid:159) (cid:131)(cid:146) (cid:151)(cid:146)(cid:153) (cid:128)(cid:136)(cid:160)(cid:135) (cid:136)(cid:141) (cid:142)(cid:139)(cid:141) (cid:128)(cid:138)(cid:146) ."
[7] In the receipt no.13 dated 25/08/2015 in the sum of Rs.5,000/- also, there is a mention that
"20/01/2016 (cid:138) (cid:139)(cid:141)(cid:147) (cid:150) (cid:158)(cid:139)(cid:147)(cid:141)(cid:130)(cid:129)(cid:141) (cid:148)(cid:137) (cid:132)(cid:130) (cid:149)(cid:153)(cid:141)(cid:159) (cid:131)(cid:146) (cid:151)(cid:146)(cid:153) (cid:128)(cid:136)(cid:160)(cid:135) (cid:136)(cid:141) (cid:142)(cid:139)(cid:141) (cid:128)(cid:138)(cid:146) ." This document is also
dated 25/08/2015. Terms and conditions are mentioned in the receipt overleaf which also bears
signature of the complainant in which it is contended that if programme is cancelled, advance could
not be refunded as one of the condition. Our attention is invited to the various receipts that the
complainant has agreed that hall can be given to other person for booking and made endorsement
below the documents of receipt. In these facts and circumstances of the case, it appears that
complainant had informed by letter dated 15/01/2016 on the subject of the refund of amount
making reference to various receipts for total sum of Rs.85,000/- inclusive of receipt no.012 dated
25/08/2015 for Shubha Mangal Hall in the sum of Rs.16,000/-, receipt no.013 dated 25/08/2015
for Shubha Mangal Hall Deposit in the sum of Rs.5,000/-, receipt no.012 dated 25/08/2015 for
Swapna Sajawat Decorators in the sum of Rs.16,000/-, receipt no.013 dated 25/08/2015 for Yash
Decorators in the sum of Rs.16,000/-, Cash/Credit Receipt No. Nil dated 25/08/2015 in the sum of
Rs.16,000/- and receipt no.012 dated 25/08/2015 for Swapna Mangal Dining Hall in the sum of
Rs.16,000/-. By said letter, complainant further informed regret that due to some domestic reasons,
marriage is cancelled seeking refund of amount paid in the sum of Rs.85,000/-.
[8] Our attention is invited to certain rulings in this regard on behalf of the appellant as under:-
[1994] 3 CPJ (NC) 54 - Mukta Kalyan Mandapam vs. N. Radhakrishna - decided the Hon'ble
National Commission in which grievance of the complainant that he paid hiring charges in full while
booking Kalyana Mandapam for particular date but, subsequently he cancelled that booking and
wanted refund of money, but such refund was wrongly denied by the opponent. In that case, it was
defence of the opponent that under no circumstances, there would be refund of amount in the event
of cancellation of booking. Hon'ble National Commission observed that the dispute as to whether
the refund should have been allowed or not, does not fall within the scope of the Consumer
Protection Act, 1986 so long as no case of deficiency in service is made out. Thus, opinion was
expressed that revision petitioner may urge his claim before the Civil Court and he will be at liberty
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/11386389/ 3Ram Mangal Sanskrutik Bhavan ... vs Aanand Dattatray Koli on 21 August, 2018
to do so notwithstanding the dismissal of the present complaint.
[9] In next ruling, Deepak Kumar vs. Sahraz Husain - [2009] 4 CPR 227 - Appeal No.926 of 2008
was decided on 04/09/2009 in which due to death, booking was cancelled. Refund of which was
refused. It was held in that case that no prior intimation of cancellation of booking of marriage
house was given to the opponent and the marriage house was kept vacant for ceremony of the
complainant. As per terms of agreement between the parties, the booking amount was not
refundable. Thus in refusing to refund the booking amount, no deficiency in service has been
committed. In that case, it was observed that no printed receipt was given to the complainant by the
opponent and document was in the form of deposit receipt and on overleaf no such term was printed
that no money will be refunded in case of cancellation. It was observed that incident of death of
family member was beyond control of the complainant and entire programme was to be cancelled
on account of sad demise and then at-least 50% of the deposited amount is required to be refunded
to the complainant. Considering the documents, the argument that whole booking amount was to be
refunded was not accepted.
[10] In third ruling in - K.Babu Prasad Reddy vs. Rajasekhar Reddy - another case of cancellation of
booking is reported in [1996] 1 CPR 46. There was no evidence of intimation given to the opponent
of cancellation and complaint was dismissed for relief of refund. In the appeal, it was observed that
there was no deficiency in service. As the complainant did not inform cancellation and even when
some other party came for booking the Kalyanmandapam between 19/12/1992 and 20/12/1992, the
opponent could not oblige them. Thus, considering material on record, the registers produced by the
opponent, District Forum came to conclusion in that case that the opponent did not let out the
Kalyanamandapam on that day to anybody else. In appeal, it was observed by the State Commission,
Andhra Pradesh that there was no merit in the appeal as there was no deficiency in service on the
part of the opponent. Moreover, appeal filed with prayer to condone the delay of 18 days in
presenting the appeal was dismissed as not satisfactorily explained.
[11] Next ruling between P.C.Murugesan vs. C.Padmavathi decided by State Commission, Chennai -
reported in 2015 0 AIR (SC) 2006 - in which complainant had paid advance to the opponent for
booking of marriage hall and marriage was cancelled. In the facts and circumstances of the case,
State Commission held that the opponent had not violated the contract so as to make them liable.
According to the advocate for the appellant, learned forum below ought to have considered the
binding effect of these judgments so as to dismiss the complaint. Reference is made to - Foreshore
Co-operative Housing Society Limited vs. Praveen D. Desai (Dead) the Lrs. And others to canvass
the decision of larger benches to burden the court. Final reference is made to ruling in Central Board
of Dawoodi Bohra Community and another vs. State of Maharashtra and other - reported in 2005 0
AIR (SC) 752 - to argue that learned forum below ought to have considered the binding effect of
decision in the aforesaid case.
[12] On the other hand on behalf of the respondent, it is contended that when booking was cancelled
in the present case, intimation was given to the opponent before the date of marriage and deposits
advanced for such purposes was the duty of the opponent to refund the advance at least partly if not
fully. Reference was made to Contour Holiday Resorts Private Ltd. vs. K.N.Bhuvandndranatha
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/11386389/ 4Ram Mangal Sanskrutik Bhavan ... vs Aanand Dattatray Koli on 21 August, 2018
Kamath - reported in II (2013) CPJ 245 (NC). In that case, booking done for marriage of daughter of
the complainant was unilaterally cancelled by petitioner just to accommodate another business
associate. In the result, the Hon'ble National Commission awarded compensation considering
mental agony and suffering undergone on such occasion by family which be measured just in terms
of money alone.
[13] Next ruling on behalf of the respondent cited in - Surinder Kumar vs. Baba Makhan Shah
Lobana Foundation - IV (2005) CPJ 36 - in which case, the complainant had booked hall for
celebration of marriage of son. However, booking had to cancel on account of illness of his mother.
Refund was declined on the ground that condition no.11 of the terms and condition of the booking
did not permit the refund of the advance money in case of booking wag got cancelled. The Hon'ble
State Commission Chandigargh remanded the matter back for fresh adjudication.
[14] After making reference to the ruling in CCI Chambers Co- op.Hsg.Society Ltd. vs. Development
Credit Bank Ltd. - III (2003) CPJ 9 (SC) - the State Commission considered the prayers of the
complainant and held that in absence of prayer to declared the condition no.11 ultra vires, the relief
sought regarding refund on the ground of deficiency in service had to be considered in accordance
with law and specific finding is to be recorded as to whether the respondent committed deficiency in
service within the meaning of Sections 2(1)(g) and 2(1)(h) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. In
that case, the case was remanded for decision afresh according to law to the District Forum on the
ground that submissions of appellant to be considered and decided as to the condition no.11 being
unjust, illegal and opposed to public policy and unconscionable under the Indian Contract Act, 1872.
[15] Finally, reference was made to ruling in - Dr.M.K.Sebastian vs. Dr.N.Jagadeesan & anr. - I
(1998) CPJ 242 - decided by the State Commission, Pondicherry. In that case, complainant had
booked a marriage hall by paying advance. Complainant cancelled the booking and sought refund of
amount. Opponent did not refund the amount.
Complainant filed consumer complaint. It is held that there is no deficiency in service. In reply,
opponent replied that advance will not be refunded on the basis of printed entries on the receipt as
to non- entitlement of refund. It was held that money can be appropriated only in accordance with
law.
However, there would be deficiency in service. In the facts and circumstances of the case, therefore,
it was held that the opponent was entitled to detain 15% of the booking amount and was directed to
pay balance together with interest @12% p.a. from the date of cancellation of booking.
[16] Considering these rulings in the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the view that in
the present case, deposits were accepted by the opponent under different heads, such as on account
of marriage hall, decoration, chairs, reception goods as such and dining hall etc. for marriage on
20/01/2016. Same amounts were accepted by the opponent on 25/08/2015. The booking of that
date i.e.20/01/2016 was cancelled for some reason on 01/11/2015. At the time of booking, opponent
had taken endorsement from the complainant that liberty is granted to the opponent that the date
20/01/2016 can be given to other party for booking. In receipts also, such liberty was granted by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/11386389/ 5Ram Mangal Sanskrutik Bhavan ... vs Aanand Dattatray Koli on 21 August, 2018
complainant on 01/11/2015 while marriage was fixed on 20/01/2016. It must be noted that the
documents prepared on account of expenses of booking advanced were printed receipts have also
printed terms and conditions readily present to the complainant for signature. In such cases, when
consumer has booked a marriage hall and other incidental services by depositing certain sum, in the
facts and circumstances of each case, Consumer Fora need to apply its mind as to whether the
deposit was advanced under the contract which was well understood between the parties and
whether rival parties were aware of their contractual obligations on the basis of promises made. In
the present case, we find from the receipts prepared for receiving the advance and handwritten
documents whereby the complainant had signed and endorsed that in case of booking date
20/01/2016 is cancelled, he will not get part of the booking amount. However, that was not final
word given by the complainant as had he allowed the opponent to assign the date 20/01/2016 to
others. Since such endorsement was made on 01/11/2015 well in advance before the date
20/01/2016, it was possible for the opponent to advertise the said date for booking by others, but no
such step was taken in the present case. In our view, when deposits were accepted on account of
different heads not only for marriage hall, but also for decoration, chairs, articles for pooja, fans etc.,
opponent should not have unreasonably refused the refund of amount, though in our view,
complainant is not entitled for 100% refund of amount advanced. The argument that in such cases
provisions of Consumer Protection Act, 1986 would not apply as observed in the earlier order passed
by the Hon'ble National Commission cannot be accepted as each case will have to be considered in
the light of facts and circumstances made out in the complaint. In the Consumer Protection Act,
1986, merely because the Civil Court will have jurisdiction to decide the civil dispute, does not mean
that a 'consumer' is barred from approaching the consumer fora so as to complain against the
opponent on account of 'deficiency' in services or 'unfair trade practice' or 'restrictive trade practice',
as the case may be. Section 3 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 does provide additional or
supplementary remedy for the consumer to approach the Consumer Fora. In the facts and
circumstances of the case, in our view, learned forum below cannot be faulted with in entertaining
the consumer complaint and deciding the complaint. However, considering the reasons for
cancellation of booking mentioned by the complainant and the fact that booking was cancelled well
in advance upon giving sufficient liberty for the opponent to advertise for the hall for use of any
other party and considering that such opportunity was available for the opponent since 01/11/2015
though notice was sent by the complainant on 15/01/2016 for refund of amount of Rs.85,000/- on
account of cancellation of booking of the hall, we are persuaded to consider the ruling cited before
us in Dr.M.K.Sebastian vs. Dr.N.Jagadeesan & anr. - I (1998) CPJ 242 - which appears to have been
in larger interest of justice allowing the opponent to retain or detain 15% amount of the amount
deposited and refund rest of the amount together with interest. In our view, therefore, we must
modify the impugned judgment and order by directing the opponent to retain 15% of the amount
advanced by way of deposits and to refund 85% of the amount to the complainant together with
interest @ 9% p.a. In the facts and circumstances of the case, we set aside the clause no.4 of the
award which grants compensation for mental harassment of the complainant. We, therefore, partly
allow the appeal as follows :-
ORDER [1] Impugned judgment and order dated 29/09/2016 passed in consumer complaint
no.CC/16/121 is modified as under :-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/11386389/ 6Ram Mangal Sanskrutik Bhavan ... vs Aanand Dattatray Koli on 21 August, 2018
Appellant (original opponent) is entitled to retain or detain 15% amount of the amount advanced by
the complainant. Rest of the amount shall be refunded to the complainant together with interest
thereon @ 9% from the date of deposit till realization of the amount by the complainant along with
litigation costs in the sum of Rs.5,000/- as awarded by the learned District Forum below.
[2] Appeal is disposed off accordingly.
[3] Certified copies of this order be furnished to the parties forthwith.
Pronounced & dictated in Open court on 21st August, 2018.
