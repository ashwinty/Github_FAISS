4. Canfina unconditionally accepted the terms of letter dated 9.3.1992 written by National Power
Transmission Corporation Ltd.
5. Letter dated 9.3.1992 therefore contains the terms of the contract between the parties. It is
obvious that it is a case of a composite contract, the deal between the parties required reciprocal
deposits/investments as under :
a) Canfina was to pay National Power Transmission Corporation a sum of Rs. 80
crores by crediting account of National Power Transmission Corporation to be
opened with Canara Bank, Janpath Branch, New Delhi and on said amount being
credited National Power Transmission was to allot 17% taxable bonds in sum of Rs.
80 crores having face value of Rs. 1000/- per bond.
b) Simultaneously, National Power Transmission Corporation was to pay Rs. 3.2
cores to Canfina towards fee being 4% of the value of the bonds i.e. 4% of Rs. 80
crores = Rs. 3.2 crores. Further National Power Transmission Corporation was to
invest Rs. 60 crores in Canfina's portfolio management scheme and was to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 4Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
additionally deposit Rs. 16.8 crores with Canfina, which deposit was to carry interest
@ 11% P.A.
6. Thus Rs. 80 crores had to flow from the coffers of Canfina to National Power Transmission
Corporation and vice versa. Graphically, flow of money was as under:
Canfina Rs. 80 Crores for 17% taxable bonds
------------------------- Power Transmission Corporation Rs.3.2 crores (As fee) +
Rs.16.8 crores (deposit @ 11% pa) Plus Rs. 60 crores investment in portfolio
management scheme.
7. Canfina had also agreed to purchase 9% tax free bonds in sum of Rs. 40 crores. Accordingly, on
10.1.1992, a sum of Rs. 120 crores (which included Rs. 80 crores for the 17% taxable bonds) was
credited in Account No. 4017 in name of National Power Transmission Corporation opened by
Canara Bank, Janpath Branch. Account No. 4006 of Canfina with Canara Bank, Janpath Branch was
debited in said sum. Simultaneously thereafter, sum of Rs. 120 crores was debited from the account
of National Power Transmission Corporation and was credited in the account of Canfina. This sum
included Rs. 3.2 crores to be paid by National Power Transmission Corporation towards fee, Rs. 16.8
crores as deposit with Canfina at interest @ 11% P.A. and Rs. 60 crores to be invested in Canfina's
Portfolio Management Scheme.

Canfina allotting 8 lakh bonds of Rs. 1000/- each.
9. Various letters of allotment, each identically worded, were issued and under different letters,
different number of bonds ranging between 10,000 to 1,00,000 were allotted.
10. Number of bonds and their distinctive number differing, rest was common to each letter of
allotment. Thus, one such representative letter be noted. It reads as under:

12. By and under a trust deed dated 31.1.1990, Canara Bank as the principal trustee, had formed a
trust called 'Canara Mutual Fund'. (here-in- after referred to as the Fund).
13. The Fund had floated a scheme called 'Centriple Scheme'. On 20.3.1992 the Fund claimed to
have purchased letters of allotment of National Power Transmission Corporation from Canfina in
sum of Rs. 48 crores. However, letters of allotment were delivered by Canfina to the Fund on
2.11.1992 when transfer deed endorsed in favor of Canara Bank (Principal trustee of the Fund) were
executed by Canfina. These letters of allotment were lodged for transfer with PGCIL on 7.12.1992.
This was refused. Present proceedings are a consequence of said refusal.
14. Reason for refusal is that between March 1992 and June 1992 a scam surfaced in securities. It
was popularly known as 'The Security Scam'. On 2.6.1992, Government of India wrote a letter to
National Power Transmission Corporation Ltd. as under:
T. Sethumadhavan, Ministry of Power and Joint Secretary, Non-Conventional Energy
Sources Department of Power.
Shram Shakti Bhawan, Rafi Marg New Delhi.
D.O. No. 35011 1 92-Fin. New Delhi.
22nd June, 1992 Dear Shri Subramanian, Certain press report have been appearing
from time to time, about diversion of PSU funds to the capital market either by some
of Commercial Banks or by the Undertakings themselves, through Portfolio
Management Scheme, Ready Foreward transactions, etc. Because of the insistence of
the Commercial Banks, the PSUs under the Department of Power had to invest most
of the amounts raised by way of private placement of taxable/tax free bonds during
1991-92 with the Purchaser- Banks for different periods. In order to ensure that the
transactions carried out by the undertakings under the Department of Power are not
affected by the recent Bank scam, it is desired that you may present the position
obtaining in respect of your Company before the Board of Directors, by way of a
comprehensive paper, indicating full details. To be on the safe side, you may also not
part with the Bonds, wherever they are yet to be issued against allotment letters,
pending realisation of the amounts deposited with the Commercial Banks. Until then,
the Bonds could be kept, on behalf of the Banks in the safe custody of your Company.
2. Wherever the funds realised against the Bonds have been deposited with the
Commercial Banks, the PSUs concerned should also get comprehensive monthly
statements indicating the pattern of investments, with complete details, which should
be monitored carefully. Any doubt about non-reconciliation of funds, Bank Receipts
etc. if exists, should be carefully investigated into and the position brought to the
notice of the Board of Directors and the Department for corrective action, as called
for.

(T. Sethumadhavan)
15. Inter alia, Government of India wrote to National Power Transmission Corporation Ltd. not to
part with bonds, wherever they are yet to be issued against allotment letters, till call money was
actually paid.
16. Acting under the letter dated 22.6.1992 written by the Government of India, Board of National
Power Transmission Corporation Ltd. resolved as under:
1. CANFINA and ABFs should not be paid interest Installment as due on 10.9.92 and
30.9.92 respectively. NPTC should call for legal advice in this matter as to what will
be the possible consequences in case this interest payment to these financial
institutions is deferred. NPTC should also write a letter to Canara Bank and take their
guarantee that in case CANFINA does not pay the amount Along with interest on
amount deposited with them under portfolio management scheme on the maturity
date on 10.03.93 Canara Bank shall fully guarantee the full amount Along with
interest. A copy of this letter may be sent to JS and FA. Deptt. of Power who will refer
the matter to Deptt, of Banking with a copy to RBI for their information and advice.
2. As regard registration or transfer or allotment letters in the name of transferee
NPTC should take legal advice from some reputed legal firm and protect their
interest. Moreover, legal opinion may be put up to the Board for further
deliberations. Till that time no transfer should be registered. 14.2.7.2 As regards
allotment letters issued in the favor of ABFs no transfer should be registered till
investigations are completed.
17. On 23.9.1992 National Power Transmission Corporation Ltd. wrote a letter to Canara Bank
(Principal Trustee of the Fund) as under:
Dear Shri Shetty, You may kindly recall that CANFINA had subscribed Rs. 120 crores
for NPTC bonds- Rs. 80 crores in taxable bonds bearing 17% interest and Rs. 40
crores in tax free bonds with 9% interest. Out of the subscription, Rs. 94.5 crores
have been retained by CANFINA for placement in PSU bonds, Canbank Mutual Fund
securities etc., with indicative interest at 12%. The amount retained by CANFINA is
due for repayment on 10th March, 1993 and interest is also payable thereon at 12%.
Recently, CANFINA has also proposed to transfer Rs. 40 crores of NPTC bonds to
Canara Bank for which formal transfer application has been received by us.
Considering the present situation, the Board of NPTC desires a confirmation from
Canara Bank that they will fully honour the commitments of CANFINA to NPTC and

will this confirmation, it will be possible for us to proceed further in the matter with
servicing of bonds. As Canara Bank is the principal banker for NPTC, we request you
to give us assurance that the money will be refunded to NPTC Along with interest at
12% on 10th March, 1993 so that I will be in a position to persuade our Board to go
ahead with servicing of the bond already allotted to CANFINA.
With regards, Yours sincerely, Sd/-
(T.V. Subramaniun) Director (Finance)
18. It was followed by another letter dated 22.10.1992 which reads as under:
Dear Shri Shetty, Kindly refer to my DO letter of even number dated September 23,
1992 regarding subscription of Rs. 120 crores for NPTC Bonds- Rs. 80 crores in
taxable bonds bearing 17% interest and Rs. 40 crores in tax-free bonds with 9%

placement in PSU bonds, Canbank Mutual Fund securities etc., with indicative
interest at 12%. The amount retained by CANFINA is due for repayment on 10th
March 1993 and interest is also payable thereon at 12%. Recently, CANFINA has also
proposed to transfer Rsd. 40 crores of NPTC bonds to Canara Bank for which formal
transfer application has been received by us.
We had requested you to confirm that Canara Bank will fully honour the
commitments of CANFINA to NPTC. This confirmation is still awaited. I would
request you to expedite your reply so that we can sort out the pending issues.
With regards, Yours sincerely, Sd/-
(T.V. Subramaniun) Director (Finance)
19. There was wide spread trading in securities with funds of public sector undertakings and banks.
Share market was rigged. Major players were stock brokers. Heads of banks and public sector
undertakings were involved. Special Courts had to be created to try the offenders. The Special Court
(Transaction in Securities) Ordinance 1992 was promulgated on 6.6.1992. A Joint Committee of
Parliament (JPC) was constituted. Even Reserve Bank investigated the security transactions
involving public sector undertakings and mutual fund schemes floated by various banks.
20. Qua Canfina and Canbank Mutual Fund, J.P.C. Report indicted the two, as also Canara Bank, as
under:
Canbank Financial Services Ltd.
6.14 Canfina was set up as a wholly owned subsidiary of Canara Bank and it
commenced the operations with its Head Office at Bangalore on 1st June, 1987. Its
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 10Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
authorised and paid up capital are Rs. 50 crores and Rs. 10 crores respectively. It was
staffed mostly by personnel from Canara Bank and has branches at Ahmedabad,
Bombay, Calcutta, Hyderabad, Madras and New Delhi besides Bangalore. As the
Board comprised mostly of senior executives of Canara Bank and its Chief Executive
is also a senior official of that bank (on deputation) the company functioned under
the umbrella of the parent bank; besides it submits periodical returns on its
functioning to the Board of Canara Bank for information.
6.15 The activities authorised to be conducted by the Company are equipment
leasing, merchant-banking, venture capital and consultancy services. The Company,
initially deployed a major portion of its owned funds and deposits in equipment
leasing business and obtained the classification of an 'Equipment leasing company'
from the Department of Finance Companies of RBI; this classification entitles the
company to mobilise public deposits tot he extent of ten times its owned funds.
Irregularities in Transactions 6.16 In the context of a number of PSUs raising resources by way of
floatation of bonds in the market, the company took the role of market maker and handled 75% of
the total PSU bonds issued. It also shifted its activities to 'Porfolio Management' and 'Corporate
Investment Advisory Services'. The method adopted by this company for handling bond issues is
explained in the subsequent paragraphs.
6.17 When commissioned by a Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) to raise resources by way of bonds,
Canfina would agree to an initial subscription of a substantial portion of the Bonds with the
stipulation that the amount subscribed by it was to be kept with Canfina itself, under portfolio
management services, CIAS. At times, the rate of interest offered on the investment was lower than
the coupan rate of the bonds itself. Some illustrations of this kind have been given in the Chapter on
PSUs. The general question of the operation of the Public Sector Bonds Schemes has been discussed
in the Chapter on Ministry of Finance.
6.18 The outstanding amounts under PMS/CIAS/ICDS as on 31.12.1992, and total value of Bonds of
PSUs held by CANFINA/Canara Bank given below will give an idea of the business handled by the
company as also as of its liabilities :

6.19 CANFINA, however, does not account for these funds in its books on the plea that these are off balance-sheet transactions. The company has stated in one of its replies since the PMS funds and investments were not considered as part of company's liability and asset they were not brought to the balance sheet.... About utilisation of these funds for BR operations and their proper accounting the company has stated that the requirement that all deliveries must be against payment is not practicable on account of market practices.? In other words, CANFINA issued BRs covering these bonds to brokers, at their instance, without deliveries. Brokers, were thus enabled to get cheques, mostly for banks specified by them and then to rotate the funds at will. Without any doubt CANFINA indulged in unethical risky operation colliding with the PSUs through the medium of brokers supposedly for PMS transactions. As, however, there was no actual transfer of funds by PSUs to CANFINA, as admitted by them in their written replies to the Committee, these transactions cannot be termed as
Portfolio Management Service? at all. In any event the company has not also
admittedly complied with other requirements of the PMS such as minimum lock-in
period, prohibition of guaranteed return, risk to investor etc. The company has stated
in one of its replies to the Committee ; Under the CIAS activity, the company was
accepting funds for generally less than one year. Under this activity, conceptually the
securities were sold to the party on receiving funds for investment. Similarly, it was
bought back from the party when repayment was made. These transactions were
treated as buying and selling of securities for clients. It was presumed at that time
that the guidelines of RBI are not applicable.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 12Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
6.20 Apart from this the company had also indulged in a large volume of investment
transactions by way of purchase of units of UTI and in certain cases Government
securities, even though dealing in investments is not one of its authorized activities.
These transactions had been mostly by way of Ready forward or Double Ready
Forward deals at the instance of brokers ostensibly with other banks but essentially
with the latter's broker clients. Some of these transactions have been commented
upon by the Jankiraman Committee as illustrative examples.
6.21 The Committee have observed that CANFINA had been violating the guidelines
of RBI in regard to PMS for long. It had been pointed out by the RBI who inspected it
in March, 1991, that the Managing Director of the company had given a false
assurance to RBI in terms of his letter CANFINA - RBI INS: 1619: 89 dt. 22.9.1989
that the company had been accepting funds with lock in periods of one year and over
only. In many cases, it was observed during inspection that funds for a shorter
duration had been accepted and further, funds were allowed to be withdrawn as and
when the parties desired. The RBI had, inter alia, pointed out several other
irregularities.
6.22 It is obvious that the management of CANFINA was well aware of the affairs
being conducted irregularly. The company has pleaded in justification of its action
and condensation of not having followed PMS guidelines : We would not have been
able to do either market making of PSU Bonds or manage the PSU funds since these
guidelines were generally not followed by other competitors, mainly foreign banks
who entered this arena in early 1991 as a result of Government's liberalised policy
and started offering high yields.
Inter Corporate Placement of Funds 6.23 The company also arranged for placement of funds
received from some of its corporate clients with other corporate clients who were in need of funds
retaining a rate of return for it in the process. It has been observed during the inspection by RBI,
conducted as far back as in 1988 that funds had been placed by 'borrowers' of Canara Bank at a rate
of interest even slightly lower than that charged by that Bank and in gross violation of credit
discipline. Here again the funds received/placed were treated as 'off-balance' sheet items. However,
the letters issued/received do not appear to establish any privity of contract between the 'lender' of
the funds and the 'taker' of the funds and hence, the liability of CANFINA is not ruled out in case the
latter does not refund.
Claims by and against CANFINA 6.24 It is observed that an aggregate amount of Rs. 778.17 crores is
due to CANFINA and the possibility of recovering bulk of these funds is remote. Besides , the
company is contingently liable in respect of claims against it for Rs. 223.81 crores. Thus, the
company could lost to the extent of about Rs. 1000 crores on its speculative and reckless dealings.
This is in addition to facing an extreme liquidity crisis. It is understood that the parent bank has so
far accommodated it on a no profit no loss basis to the extent of over Rs. 2600 crores against
available securities with it. In this context the Chairman of the Canara Bank has stated :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 13Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
While the involvement of our two subsidiaries in the infamous episode has had an
unsettling effect on the bank, the decision to be taken in its aftermath, especially for
the bank to rescue CANFINA. However, the fact remains that it is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Canara Bank which itself is owned by the Government....
6.25 The Committee hope that the nature and extent of the financial assistance being
provided by Canara Bank to its subsidiaries are such as could be justified on prudent
commercial norms. Further the parent bank cannot be absolved of the responsibility
for various irregularities of its subsidiary.
'Mutual Funds 6.62 Mutual Funds have played an important role in the capital market. The working
of the mutual funds is governed by the guidelines issued by Ministry of Finance, RBI and SEBI. A
scrutiny of securities transactions by the Committee has disclosed involvement of the Mutual Funds
also in irregular transactions. The Committee examined in particular the involvement of Canbank
Mutual Fund (CMF).
6.63 CMF had violated some of the critical provisions in the guidelines issued by RBI on 7.7.1989
and Controller of Capital Issues (28.6.1990) relating to secondary and money market operations,
investments in the primary market, arms length relationship between the sponsors, its subsidiaries
and the mutual fund. The violations had been in respect of the provision requiring mutual funds to
take delivery of scrips purchased and give delivery of scrips sold, provision prohibiting mutual funds
making short sale/purchase of securities or carrying over transactions from one settlement to the
next, provisions prohibiting mutual fund to enter into any transactions of speculative nature,
provision prohibiting mutual funds to invest in any other unit trust/mutual fund, barring
exceptional circumstances and then for a temporary period and within a ceiling of 5% of its assets;
and, provision prohibiting mutual fund undertaking direct or indirect lending, portfolio/funds
management, underwriting, bills discounting, money market operations etc. 6.64 The Committee
regret to note that CMF has violated almost all the guidelines and regulations. The sponsor and its
subsidiary have derived benefit through the operations of CMF at the cost of the investors.
6.65 A majority of the secondary market operations of CMF has been carried out through just a few
brokers. 42% of the turnover of 8 schemes of CMF was transacted through 4 brokers. These brokers
had defaulted in delivering the scrips, and instances were noticed where prior approval of the
sanctioning authority was not obtained for the purchase of large quantity of shares. Instances have
been revealed where CMF had incurred considerable loss for no plausible reasons in their secondary
market transactions. Besides, there were also instances where large number of shares were sold by
CMF at prices lower than the market prices. These remain unexplained. The Special Audit Report
also pointed out several instances in which CMF used the mechanism of wrong credit to divert funds
from the CMF schemes to brokers, apparently under advice of Canfina, though these were not in
writing.
6.66 CMF also resorted to placement of short, medium and long term deposits of Public and private
limited companies ranging from three months to three years categorising all such placements as
short terms deposits. They had also entered into private placements of Non-Convertible debentures,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 14Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
subscription to promoters quota and standby arrangements. The irregularities observed in this
connection included, investment decisions for private placements made without proper analysis,
investment decisions influenced by factors concerning the business of Canara Bank or Canfina,
funds placed with several corporate clients of the Canara Bank with the understanding that they
should reduce their advance with the bank, investments made which had the effect of transferring
underwriting developments of Canara Bank/Canfina to the CMF etc. 6.67 Transactions of CMF in
non-SLR securities in one case entailed a loss of Rs. 103 crores to the Fund and ran the risk of
potential loss of Rs. 30 crores in another. While the former related to a deal with BOK through a
SGL/BR without the backing of securities the latter related to a ready forward transaction with NHB
who failed to honour the commitment on reversal transactions.
6.68 Net Assets Value (NAV) basically reflects the economic value of the fund at a given date on the
assumption that the fund needs to be redeemed. The actual NAV can be reflected by determining the
market value of all the investments deducting the liabilities arising there from divided by the
number of units. The SEBI inspection revealed that the NAVs arrived at by the Fund Managers were
inaccurate. They were thus defrauding investors.
6.69 Other irregularities/inadequacies have been observed in respect of maintenance/authenticity
of accounts, records and in respect of the Systems and internal control of CMF.
6.70 The manner in which CMF had invested the funds of the schemes indicates that it had not
exercised sufficient care, prudence and diligence in the interest of the investors of the schemes and
in several instances had exposed the investors in the schemes to high degree of risks without
disclosure of it to the investors. This in the view of the Committee, is a serious breach of trust.
6.71 when asked to comment on the repeated defaults, the representative of CMF said:-
it is true that in some areas the violations continued to take place.
6.72 Yet again the Committee do find it necessary to underline the self- admitted or
the self-evident. Officials managing this fund were negligent, derelict in the discharge
of their responsibility and committed breach of trust with investors.
21. Report of R.B.I. indicted Canfina as under:-
25.1 The Operation of the Funds Department of the company have resulted in an
overall loss of Rs. 1077/89 crore as on 20.7.1992. There is depreciation in the value of
securities (only PSU bonds) to the extent of Rs. 128.48 crore. These losses have
completely eroded the net worth of the company of Rs. 154.62 crore and as on
20.7.1992, it was negative at Rs. 923.27 crore.
25.2 In the resulting situation, the company cannot meet its commitments unless the
parent bank comes to its rescue. However, this is proving to be Herculean task. The
parent bank has decided that the company should meet its losses. In the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 15Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
circumstances, the company cannot continue to function as it will be almost
impossible to overcome the huge losses in the near future.
25.3 The Funds operation of the company have been carried out in complete violation
of the REBI/SEBI guidelines. The name CANFINA has become synonymous with
unethical and devious market practices. The records of the company are in a state of
disorder. None can vouch for their accuracy or completeness or reliability.
25.4 Even after the irregularities became public knowledge and the team was engaged
in the scrutiny of the transactions, the management did not come forward to
co-operate with the team and facilitate the scrutiny. This was the attitude at all levels.
The executives first denied knowledge of the transactions, dodged and delayed
submission of information. No piece of information was furnished by the company
willingly. Every singly piece was extracted out of the company with great difficulty.
Very often, they merely confirmed what was painstakingly found out by the
inspection team, when they could not more avoid or dodge. This attitude towards the
regulating authorities runs deep in the entire organization right from the top. This is
in sharp contrast to its attitude to JPC where they have on their own admitted the
various lapses and irregularities, as soon from their reply to the JPC. The
reluctance/unwillingness to prove information is a violation of one of the basic
condition subject to which the parent bank was allowed to fleece the subsidiary.
25.5 In view of its financial position, improper practices and attitude to regulating
authorities, it is strongly recommended that it will not be in the public interest to
allow the company to continue to function under the name and style of CANFINA.
22. It was obvious what was amiss. Sum of Rs. 60 crores invested by Canfina in the
Portfolio Management Scheme had disappeared. The rigged market had collapsed.
The money disappeared in private hands.
23. By March 1993 name of National Power Transmission Corporation Ltd. was
changed to Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. On 16.3.1993 it wrote a letter to
Canfina as under:
Dear Shri Kamath, You are aware, Power Grid Corporation of India Limited
(formerly known as M/s. National Power Transmission Corporation Limited) had
allotted Rs. 120 crores of Bonds (Rs.80 crores 17% taxable bonds and Rs. 40 crores
9% tax free bonds) to M/s. Canbank Financial Services Limited (CANFINA) on
10.03.92 on the basis of CANFINA's letter No. DCAN:Bond 1:92; dt. 6th March, 1992
and DCAN? KBP:92:Pvt. Dtd.9th March 1992. It was one of the conditions stipulated
by CANFINA in its letter of offer for subscription to the bonds that the allotment
money of Rs. 94 crores would have to be placed in deposit with CANFINA at an
interest rate of 12% per annum for a period of one year from the date of allotment i.e.
10.3.92. This offer was accepted by Powergrid in good faith vide its letter No.

The deposit of allotment money was due for repayment on 10.03.93.
On the due date i.e. 10.03.93 Powergrid had requested vide telex/fax/letter to your
HO and Delhi Branch for the repayment of the above amount of Rs. 94 crores Along
with the interest. I am sorry to say that we have not received any response from
CANFINA inspite of urgency and the involvement of a huge sum of money.
As already informed (copy enclosed) due to dejure transfer of Assets worth Rs. 4500
corores the construction requirement of the company has increased manifold and the
Company is in urgent need of fund to meet the extra financial burden.
Considering our good relations, we would request you once again to repay the
amount of Rs. 94 crores Along with interest immediately.
Kindly acknowledge the receipt and confirm repayment.
With regards, Yours sincerely, Sd/-
(T.V. Subramaniun) Director (Finance)
24. Canfina responded on 17.3.1993 as under:
To:
Sri T.V. Subramaniun Director (Finance) Power Grid Corporation Ltd.
Nehru Place, New Delhi.
Dear Sir, Sub: NPTC's Investments with Canfina We have for reference your telex
msg. on the subject matter. We appreciate the concern expressed by you in the matter
of return of investments. We would like to assure you that it is the endeavor of
Canfina to return the investments at the earliest possible opportunity. We need not
perhaps reiterate this as you already know the way in which Canfina has conducted
itself in the past whether it related Bond marketing or the promptness with which
monwy flow was ensured.
But as you are aware, the securities market at present is in a bad shape and the usual
money from Repos market has evaporated. While we are unable to generate liquidity
from the securities market, the problems have aggrevated due to large scale
depreciation of Bond values, which formed major part of the assets. The mutal fund
assets have also depreciated substantially in the stock market due to the general
down trend being witnessed these days.

we would only request you to bear with us for the time being.
Yours faithfully, Sd/-
(K.N. Kamath) Managing Director.
25. Vide letter dated 21.9.1993, alleging non-payment by Canfina, PGCIL exercised
lien on the bonds. It wrote to Canfina as under:
The Managing Director, CANBANK FINANCIAL SERVICES LTD., 19/5 and 9/6
Kareem Towers, Cunningham Road, Bangalore - 560052.
Sub:Holding of lien on Bonds of Rs. 80 crores.
Dear Sir.
Please refer to the correspondence resting with our telex/letters dated 10.03.93 and
16.03.93 requesting you to make the payment of Rs. 60 crores retained by you as
deposit since 10.03.92 Along with accrued interest. As you know, we had allotted you
on 10th march, 92, 17% taxable Bonds of the face value of Rs. 80 crores, on the basis
of your offer dated 6.3.92, which reads as under:
NPTC shall invest Rs. 60 crores with us on the date of allotment for one year under
the Portfolio Management Scheme. This investment shall generate an indicative yield
of 12% p.a. This offer of yours was accepted by us vide our letter No.
NPTC/C/COS/Bonds/50106 dated 9/10 March 92 (which again was accepted by you
on 10.03.92) resulting into a composite contract for the allotment of Bonds, the
consideration of which was retained by you in the form of a deposit payable after one
year, which in effect amounts to allotment of bonds on deferred payment basis.
On your offer the Bonds of Rs. 80 crores were allotted to you and the balance
allotment money of Rs. 60 crores was kept as deposit with you to be paid on 10.03.93
Along with accrued interest @ 12% per annum. However, all along CANFINA has
failed to pay the said allotment money of Rs. 60 crores and the accrued interest
thereon up to this date, despite several reminders and personal
persuation/discussions. The said amount has not been paid so far.
It is, therefore, now apparent that your aforesaid offer dated 6.3.92 was a
misrepresentation with a view to persuade us to issue the Bonds to you. You have not
paid the deposit amount for which the term has long expired on 10.03.93. As we are
Unpaid Seller we have not issued the Bond Certificates to you so far against the letter
of allotment dated 10.03.92. Please note that we will NOT be issuing the Bond
Certificates to you or any other nominee or transferee of yours to whom you might
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 18Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
have handed over the letter of allotment. We shall exercise our RIGHT OF LIEN on
the Bonds, in question, till our corporation is paid the full amount due towards the
allotment money Along with accrued interest, as per your commitment. Moreover, it
has also come to your notice that you have not effected the sale of 20% of the Bonds
allotted to you which were to be sold to the Public over the counter, as one of the
terms of allotment made on 10.03.92.
We once again call upon you to to pay the allotment money kept as deposit Along
with accrued interest within three weeks from the receipt of this letter. If our
Corporation is not paid the allotment money Along with accrued interest and you do
not perform your part of the contract during the said period we will not only exercise
our Right of Lien on the Bonds till the allotment money is received by us, but would
also be entitled to annul/forefeit the letters of allotment issued to CANFINA and
would also take such legal action against CANFINA as permissible under the law.
Further, you may please inform all the parties to whom you might have transferred
our letters of allotment that we shall exercise our 'Right of Lien' until we are paid the
aforesaid amount of Rs. 60 crores towards the allotment money kept as deposit Along
with accrued interest, as per your contract.
Please acknowledge the receipt.
Thanking you, Yours faithfully, sd/-

26. On 9.11.1993, PGCIL amended it's Articles of Association empowering itself to
forfeit the bonds in case of failure of payment. On 20.1.1994, PGCIL issued a notice to
Canfina that in case it did not pay a sum of Rs. 60 crores with interest @ 12% p.a.
within 14 days, the bonds would be forfeited as the same would be unpaid for. On
11.2.1994 PGCIL formally forfeited bonds of the face value of Rs. 63.2 crores and

27. Before letter dated 20.1.1994 and 11.2.1994 were issued by PGCIL, on 25.11.1993,
Canara Bank, as the principal trustee of Canbank Mutual Fund lodged a petition
under Section 111(4) of the Companies Act, 1956 praying :- '(a) That the Company be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 20Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
directed to rectify the register of the holders of bond in respect of 17 percent NPTC
bonds bearing Nos. A-1300001 to A-170000 and A-1720001 to A-1800000 under
LOa Nos. NPTC/22, 23, 24,25,26,27,30 to 37/91- 92 and to place the name of the
Petitioners in the said register of bonds in respect of the said bonds in place and stead
the name of Canbank Financial Services Ltd. and/or any other person whose name
may be appearing on the register and to transfer the said bonds in the name of the
Petitioners.
(b) That the Company be directed to pay to the Petitioners half yearly interest accrued on the said
bonds on 31st December, 1992 and 30th June, 1993 and/or any other further interest falling due on
the said bonds till the Petitioners name is entered on the register of bond holders.'
28. A preliminary objection was raised by the appellant before the Company Law Board (CLB). It
was to the effect that Canara Bank was wholly owned by Government of India and so was it. Dispute
therefore should be decided by the Committee of Secretaries. Vide order dated 4.6.1992 CLB
rejected the said objection. Said order was challenged before the court. Challenge failed. The order
has since attained finality. It may be noted that a similar dispute involving Canara Bank and
National Thermal Power Corporation stands decided by the Supreme Court in the decision reported
as Canara Bank v. NTPC JT 2000 SC 491. It was held that a Mutual Fund was not a public sector
company. The CLB accordingly took up the issue on merits.
29. At the second stage, appellant opposed the petition, inter alia, pleading bar of limitation and
alternatively on the plea that it had exercised unpaid sellers lien and that the board of directors had
acted in good faith to protect the interest of the appellant. It was urged that Canfina had not repaid
sum of Rs. 60 crores much less interest @ 12% P.A. i.e. the amount invested in the Portfolio
Management Scheme of Canfina. It was urged that Canara Bank, Canfina and the Mutual Fund were
one and the same as all operated under one umbrella. That the amendment to the Articles of
Association to empower the board to forfeit the bonds was valid and retrospective operation of the
amendment was legal. That the appellant acted under directions of the Central Government.
30. By and under the impugned order dated 2.7.2003 all defenses were reflected. Petition filed by
Canara Bank was allowed with the following direction :
The name of Can Fina will be restored in respect of the bonds impugned in the
petition which have been forfeited within 15 days of this order. Thereafter, redeeming
the bonds, the company should pay to the Fund, the face value of the bonds along
with coupon rate at 17% per annum till the date of the maturity of bonds and 12% per
annum (simple) on the face value from the date of maturity till the date of payment.
The entire amount should be paid on or before 15.8.2003.
31. Before noting the issues raised in the present appeal and dealing with the same, I may note that
sum of Rs. 16.8 crores deposited in account of the appellant which had to carry interest @ 11% P.A.
has been repaid by Canfina to the appellant and between the parties there is no dispute qua said
amount. Further, Canfina has not paid a penny to the appellant nor paid any interest or dividend in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 21Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
respect of the sum of Rs. 60 crores invested in the Portfolio Management Scheme. Further 9% tax
free bonds in sum of Rs. 40 crores are not in issue.
32. In the present appeal, Shri Shanti Bhushan, learned Senior Counsel for PGCIL urged:-
a) That Section 111 of the Companies Act 1956 applied only to shares and debentures.
That as defined in Section 2(12) of the Companies Act 1956 'Bonds' are debentures.
Counsel urged that said issue stands conclusively decided by and under the decision
dated 10.10.2002 in Co.A.(B) No. 5/1995 Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. v. Citi
Bank N.A. and Ors.
b) That the petition before the CLB was barred by limitation. It was urged that
Section 111 of the Companies Act confers a right on a transferee to appeal to the CLB
against refusal of a Company to register the transfer of or the transmission by
operation of law of the right to any share or debenture. The limitation for such an
appeal has been laid down in Sub-section 3 of Section 111 which is 2 months from the
receipt of notice of the refusal or where no notice has been sent by the company
within 4 months from the date of which the instrument of transfer was delivered to
the company. Counsel urged that Sub-section (1), (2) and (3) of Section 111 of the
Companies Act, clearly provided that once an intimation of transfer has been made
by the transferee, where there is an actual refusal to register the transfer or there is
no such actual refusal to register the transfer, the transferee has been given the right
to appeal to CLB against the refusal or against inaction of the company or for both.
Such limitations have been provided as 2 months from the date of refusal in the case
of refusal and 4 months from the date of intimation in the case of any absence of
refusal. It was submitted that in the present case, the intimation of transfer was given
by the respondent to the Company on 7.12.1992. The petition filed on 25.11.1993 was
therefore hopelessly time-barred. That view taken by CLB that Sub-section 4 of
Section 111 of the Companies Act 1956 gives an independent right makes the entire
Section 111 absurd. There would be no point in providing a limitation under
Sub-section (3) of that Section if it could just be avoided by heading a petition under
Section 111(4) instead of Section 111(2) of the Act. Counsel submitted that the proper
view of correct interpretation of Section 111 would be that the cases which are clearly
covered under Sub-section (2) would be governed by the limitations provided by
Sub-section (3) whether one heads the petition under Sub-section (2) or under
Sub-section (4). And, it is only cases which are not covered by under Section 111(3)
would alone be dealt with by the power under Section 111(4) of the Act. It was urged
that Sub Section 4 is not confined to cases of refusal to register the transfer it also
applies to cases where a person without sufficient cause is entered in the register of
transfer of the company or cases in which a person after having entered into register
is without sufficient cause omitted there from. It is these cases to which no limitation
is applicable and the CLB can proceed to rectify the register in such cases. Counsel
submitted that while Sub-section (4) gives right to a transferee to appeal against the
refusal of the company to register the transfer or failure to take action the transfer, it

does authorize the CLB to itself proceed to rectify the register. The result would be
that Sub-section (4) provides for rectification of the register by the CLB itself without
giving the company right to rectify the same while Sub-section (2) applies in case of
refusal of the company to register the transfer. In case of a refusal under Sub-section
(4) if a person has come up for appeal against such refusal within the period of
limitation provided by Sub-section (3), the CLB may adjudicate upon the correctness
of the company to refuse the transfer and after adjudicating the same the CLB may
send the same back to the company for further action. Counsel submitted that if this
interpretation is given to Sub-section (4) of Section 111 there would be no conflict
between Sub-section (3) and (4) and the entire provision of Section 111 could be
harmonized. On the other hand if an interpretation is given to Sub-section (4) as for
impugned order, there would be a clear conflict between Sub-section (3) and (4) and
it would introduce uncertainty in Section 111 itself. Mr. Shanti Bhushan urged that it
is well settled that when two interpretations are possible only that interpretation
should be adopted which would cause harmony to different Sub sections of the
Section and any other interpretation which introduces conflict between different Sub
sections of the same section has to be avoided.
c) That as per sub sections 2 and 4 of Section 3 of the Capital Issues (Control) Act
1947, the Central Government was empowered to lay down terms under which
securities could be offered for sale by companies. Approval granted by the Central
Government vide letter dated 7.2.1992 was on the condition that PGCIL would be
subject to the measures of control that may be brought into operation by the Central
Government. That on 22.6.1992, Central Government wrote a letter containing a
directive to PGCIL that it should not part with the bonds unless money was actually
received and since none was received, bonds could not be issued. If impugned orders
were to stand, PGCIL would be compelled to violate the term of sanction dated
7.2.1992 read with the directive dated 22.6.1992.
d) That the appellant had an unpaid vender's lien on the letters of allotment and
since sum of Rs. 60 crores was not paid by Canfina, PGCIL was justified in forfeiting
the letters of allotment.
e) Canbank Mutual Fund was not a bona-fide purchaser for value and could not
maintain the action. Counsel urged that assuming title of the letters of allotment
could be transferred by delivery of allotment letters, the transfer took place on
2.11.1992. By said date the scam had surfaced much before and Canara Bank, the
principal trustee was aware that the scam had surfaced. The scam was prior to even
20.3.1992, the date on which the Fund claims to have purchased the letters of
allotment. Principal trustee was aware that Canfina had not paid for the bonds.
Counsel urged that Canara Bank is the holding company of Canfina. Canara Bank is
also the principal trustee of Canbank Mutual Fund. Canara Bank was the banker of
Canfina and the Fund. In these circumstances, the knowledge of Canara Bank as
principal trustee of the Fund that the purchase price for the bonds had not in reality
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 23Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
been paid can be attributed as knowledge of the Fund as Canara Bank exercised
supervisory and administrative control over, both, Canfina and the Fund. Relying
upon report of JPC and RBI (contents noted in para 20 and 21 above) Counsel urged
that it is evident that Canara Bank, Canfina and the Fund acted in tandem and were
collaborators in the scam.
33. Per contra, Shri C.S. Sundaram learned Senior Counsel for the respondent urged:-
a) Letters of allotment are goods in as much as they have the same effect as bonds.
Letters of allotment in question themselves represent the debt due from the issuer,
they were transferable and at any time could be exchanged for the bonds. Counsel
referred to clauses 6, 10, 11 and 12 of the letters of allotment to bring home the point.
That Section 108 of the Companies Act 1956 provides for registration of transfer
relating to shares or debentures on the basis of letters of allotment. Thus letters of
allotment are goods which are freely transferable. That Government Notification No.
GSR 1294 (E) dated 17.11.1986 allows transfer of bonds issued by Government
companies on the basis of letter of allotment and therefore in view of the notification
qua government companies, a letter of allotment stands on the same footing as
bonds. Referring to Clause 11 of the letter of allotment, Counsel urged that the
notification stood incorporated by reference in the letter of allotment itself.
b) Alternatively, counsel urged that as defined under Section 2(4) of the Sale of
Goods Act 1930, letters of allotment were documents of title to goods and as title
documents, could be freely sold.
c) That Sub-section 4 of Section 111 as in force in the year 1993 when petition was
filed before CLB was as amended by Companies (Amendment) Act 1988 w.e.f.
31.5.1991. Being subsequent amendment the same would prevail over earlier law.
Since the subsequent amendment clearly omits specifying any period of limitation for
initiating proceedings, Courts cannot impute limitation. Counsel urged that Section
111(4) deals with a situation where refusal is challenged or where there is delay or
default in entering the names in the register of members and rectification of
members is sought for. That Section 111(2) applies only when decision of refusal to
register has been taken and intimated. In the instant case this was done after petition
was filed before CLB (as per letter dated 20.1.1994 and 11.2.1994).
d) That consideration was paid by the Fund to Canfina on 20.3.1992 evidenced by the
deal slips. That there was no dispute between Canfina and the Fund that transfer took
place on 20.3.1992. This was accepted by CLB. That the question as to when a
transfer takes place is a question of fact and under Section 10(F) of the Companies
Act 1956 appeal lies on question of law. Findings of fact cannot be challenged. That
mere handing over physical possession of letters of allotment in November 1992 is
neither here nor there.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 24Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
e) That contract between the parties was a composite contract. First limb of the
contracts stood fulfillled when sum of Rs. 80 crores was credited to the account of the
appellant maintained with Canara Bank. Consideration stood paid. Second limb of
the contract required the money to flow back to Canfina. This happened as per
contract. Thus appellant had no unpaid sellers lien.
f) That for exercise of unpaid sellers lien, sine qua non was that possession of goods
had to remain with the seller. If possession was parted with, merely because the seller
came into possession of the goods at a later stage, it could not retain possession
under unpaid sellers lien.
g) Assuming that letters of allotment are documents of title to goods and transfer
from Canfina to the Fund would have to be made in good faith, in the instant case
there are no findings, much less any material to show lack of good faith.

35. Section 82 of the Companies Act 1956 reads as under:-
82. Nature of shares or debentures.- The shares or debentures other interest of any
member in a company shall be movable property, transferable in the manner
provided by the articles of the company.
36. Section 108(1) of the Companies Act 1956 reads as under:- 108. Transfer not to be registered
except on production of instrument of transfer.-
(1) A company shall not register a transfer of shares in, or debentures of, the company, unless a
proper instrument of transfer duly stamped and executed by or on behalf of the transferor and by or
on behalf of the transferee and specifying the name, address and occupation, if any, of the
transferee, has been delivered to the company along with the certificate relating to the shares or
debentures or if no such certificate is in existence, along with the letter of allotment of the shares or
debentures:
Provided that where, on an application in writing made to the company by the
transferee and bearing the stamp required for an instrument of transfer, it is proved
to the satisfaction of the Board of directors that the instrument of transfer signed by
or on behalf of the transferor and by or on behalf of the transferee has been lost, the
company may register the transfer on such terms as to indemnify as the Board may
think fit:
Provided further that nothing to this section shall prejudice any power of the
company to register as shareholder or debenture-holders any person to whom the
right to any shares in, or debentures of, the company has been transmitted by
operation of law.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 26Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
37. Section 2(12) of the Companies Act 1956 defines a debenture as under:-
debenture? includes debenture stock bonds and any other securities of a company,
whether constituting a charge on the assets of the company or not.
38. Section 2(7) of the Sale of Goods Act 1930 defines goods as:-
'goods' means every kind of movable property other than actionable claims and
money; and includes stock and shares, growing crops, grass, and things attached to
or forming part of the land which are agreed to be severed before sale or under the
contract of sale.
39. Government of India notification No. GSR 1294 (E) dated 17.12.1986 reads as under:-
G S R 1294 (E) : In exercise of the powers conferred by Clause (a) of Sub- section (1)
of Section 620 of Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956), the Central Government hereby
directs that the provisions of Sub-section (1) of Section 108 of the said Act, insofar as
it requires a proper instrument of transfer, to be duly stamped and executed by or on
behalf of the transferor and by or on behalf of the transferee, shall not apply with
respect of bonds issued by a Government company, provided that an intimation by
the transferee specifying his name, address and occupation, if any, has been delivered
to the company along with the certificate relating to the bond; and if no such
certificate is in existence, along with the letter of allotment of the bond, a copy of this
notification having been laid in draft before both the Houses of Parliament as
required by Sub-section (2) of Section 620 of the said Act.
40. PGCIL is admittedly a government company. Notification GSR 1294 (E) dated 17.12.1986 applies
to the company. In so far Section 108(1) of the Companies Act 1956 applies to the company, the
notification exempts the instrument of transfer, transferring bonds, to be duly stamped, provided
that an intimation by the transferee has been delivered to the company along with the certificate
relating to the bond and if no such certificate is in existence, along with the letter of allotment of the
bond.
41. A conjoint reading of Section 2(12) and Section 82 of the Companies Act 1956 along with Section
2(7) of the Sale of Goods Act 1930 makes it abundantly clear that bonds are movable
property/goods.
42. A conjoint reading of Section 108(1) of the Companies Act 1956 and GSR 1294 (E) dated
17.12.1986 makes it clear that qua government companies, where bond certificates are not issued,
letters of allotment stand at par with bonds.
43. The instant letter of allotment clearly states that bond certificates would be issued after 3
months of allotment of bonds (Clause 10) and would be exchanged against the allotment letter
(Clause 10). Clause 12 of the letter of allotment clearly states that on request, the letter of allotment
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 27Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
will be split into marketable lots on surrender of original letter of allotment. Clause 11 of the letter of
allotment, incorporates by reference, Notification No. GSR 1294 (E) dated 17.12.1986. Mr. C.S.
Sundaram was perfectly correct when he submitted that instant letters of allotment are goods
inasmuch as they have the same effect as bonds. Instant letters of allotment have all the features of a
bond and in themselves represent the debt due from the issuer. (PGCIL) They are transferable and
can be exchanged for a bond.
44. Shri Shanti Bhushan, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant had referred to a passage from
the decision dated 10.10.2002 in Co.A. (B) 5/95 Power Grid Corporation Ltd. v. Citi Bank. Dealing
with an identical bond sold by Canfina to Citi Bank, Vikramajit Sen, J., in para 13 observed:-
The object and intent of Section 108, the compliance of which has been held to be
mandatory in Mannalal Khetan v. Kedar Nath Khetan and Ors. , would be frustrated
if Letters of Allotment exchanged between two persons would attain infinite currency
and transferability. In my view Section 108 cannot be availed of by CITIBANK, (to
whom it was not addressed) in the role of a transferor. CITIBANK has at best merely
a 'right to sue', which cannot be transferred under Section 6(e) of the Transfer of
Property Act. The protection of this Section would inure only to the benefit of the
person to whom the Letter of Allotment is issued, otherwise it would itself attain the
attributes of shares, bonds, debentures and be freely transferable. Letters of
Allotment are not a negotiable instruments.
45. But just prior to said observations, in the same para His Lordship has observed:-
However, while Mr. Kaura may be correct in relying on Section 108 of the Companies
Act insofar as CITIBANK is concerned, this provision would not come to the succour
of CANFINA as the successor in title of CITIBANK. Section 108 was introduced into
the statute to check the currency of blank transfer forms. Logically, only CITIBANK
(as the transferee) was eligible to claim the registration of the 'Bonds' in its name on
the strength of the Letters of Allotment, which cannot be equated with or be held to
be synonymous to shares, bonds or debentures which are inherently and per se
negotiable.
46. Furthermore, in para 14, it was observed:-
14. Furthermore, the claim of 'CITIBANK' assumes that despite the forfeiture
CANFINA enjoyed valid title over the Bonds which it purportedly sold to CITIBANK
the transfer of which was refused by POWERGRID. What needs to be coagitated
upon is whether CITIBANK could have entered into further transactions in respect of
these Bonds, title of which is contingent on CITIBANK succeeding in its action under
Section 111 of the Act. It must again be understood that the rights of CITIBANK are
the second link in the chain of transactions i.e. between CANFINA and CITIBANK
when the first and preceding link itself i.e. between POWERGRID and CANFINA has
been broken and rendered as under. It is certainly debatable as to whether CANFINA
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 28Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
could have transferred/sold Bonds to CITIBANK without having perfected its title to
them by legal action. It is the common case that no Bonds whatsoever were issued
even to CANFINA, which has neither taken any action under the Companies Act, nor
has assailed the forfeiture by POWERGRID on 11.2.1994. What has made the
situation worse confounded is that CITIBANK has transferred them further, albeit
coincidentally to the very party from whom it had purportedly purchased the Bonds,
i.e., CANFINA. At the highest, CITIBANK merely had a right to sue POWERGRID for
the registration of Bonds purportedly purchased by it from CANFINA.
47. Facts relatable to aforesaid decision are that Canfina had transferred letters of allotment for
bonds worth 30 crores to Citibank. PGCIL had refused to transfer the letter of allotment in name of
Citibank when it was lodged for transfer. defense was the same as in the instant case. Citibank had
approached CLB. Against decision of CLB, PGCIL had filed the appeal. During pendency of the
proceedings before CLB, Canfina repurchased the letters of allotment. It was in this context that it
was held that Section 6(e) of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 which states that a mere right to sue
cannot be transferred, was attracted. Meaning thereby that according to the decision since Citibank
was litigating on the issue whether bonds/letters of allotment could be forfeited, by re-transferring
the letters of allotment it had in fact transferred a mere right to sue to Canfina.
48. It is trite that ratio of a decision cannot be dissociated from the facts. Addition or subtraction of
a fact may render a decision not to be followed as a precedent.
49. Be that as it may, Section 2(12) and Section 82 of the Companies Act 1956, Section 2(7) of the
Sale of Goods Act 1930, Notification No. GSR 1294 (E) dated 17.12.1986 and the special features of
the letters of allotment noted by me in para 34 above were unfortunately not brought to the notice of
brother Vikramajit Sen, J.
50. Matter could be viewed in the context of Section 108(1) of the Companies Act 1956 from another
angle. Whereas shares or debenture (bonds being debentures as per Section 2(12) of the Companies
Act 1956) indicate the interest of a person in the company as members or debenture holders, a share
or debenture certificate or letter of allotment is an evidence of the entitlement of the interest.
Section 108(1) of the Companies Act 1956 brings out the aforesaid where it is clearly provided that a
company shall not register a transfer of shares or debentures of the company unless either the share
or debenture certificate, or if no such certificate is in existence, a letter of allotment is delivered to
the company. The scheme of the Act is that in order to register the transfer of share or debenture the
evidence in the form of either a share/debenture certificate or letter of allotment is essential. The
Act clearly recognises a letter of allotment as an alternative evidence to a share/debenture
certificate. It would also be relevant to note that all companies invariably issue letters of allotment at
the first instance and thereafter in lieu of the letters of allotment issue share/debenture certificates.
Instant letters of allotment clearly makes the same as marketable commodity. Evidenced by Clause
12 of the Instructions forming integral part of the letter of allotment wherein it is recorded that on
request, letter of allotment will be split into marketable lots.

51. As regards the second submission of Shri Shanti Bhushan, learned Senior Counsel for the
appellant, that the petitioner could not invoke Sub-section 4 of Section 111 and remedy was under
Sub-section 2 of Section 111 and therefore petition was barred by limitation, a brief purview of the
legislative history of relevant provisions of the Companies Act 1956 needs to be noted.
52. Prior to the amendments incorporated by the Companies (Amendment) Act 1988 w.e.f.
31.5.1991, remedy for an aggrieved transferee was provided under Section 111 of the Companies Act
1956 and the forum was the CLB. A concurrent remedy was provided under Section 155 by way of an
application to the High Court for rectification of register of members/debenture-holders. While the
then Section 111 dealt with the right of appeal only relating to transfer, Section 155 provided the
right to any aggrieved person for rectification of the register. Unlike the provisions of Section 111
there was no limitation for proceeding under Section 155. Judicial view was that remedies under
Section 111 and 155 are alternative remedies and the choice of electing either was at the discretion of
an aggrieved person. By the Companies (Amendment) Act 1988 provisions of Section 155 and 111
were assimilated. Section 155 was deleted and Sub-section 4 of Section 111 was amended. The forum
became one i.e. CLB. Post amenment by the Companies (Amendment) Act 1988, Sub-section 1, 2, 3
and 4 of Section 111 read as under:-
Section 111. Power to refuse registration and appeal against refusal.
(1) If a company refuses, whether in pursuance of any power of the company, under
its articles or otherwise, to register the transfer of, or the transmission by operation
of law to the right to, any shares or interest of a member in, or debentures of, the
company, it shall, within two months from the date on which the instrument of
transfer, or the intimation of such transmission, as the case may be, was delivered to
the company, send notice of refusal to the transferee and the transferor or to the
person giving intimation of such transmission, as the case may be, giving reasons for
such refusal.
(2) The transferor or transferee, or the person who gave intimation of the
transmission by operation of law, as the case may be, may appeal to the Company
Law Board against any refusal of the company to register the transfer or
transmission, or against any failure on its part within the period referred to in
Sub-section (1), either to register the transfer or transmission or to send notice of its
refusal to register the same.
(3) An appeal under Sub-section (2) shall be made within two months of the receipt
of the notice of such refusal or, where no notice has bee sent by the company, within
four months from the date on which the instrument of transferor, or the intimation of
transmission, as the case may be, was delivered to the company.
(4) If-
(a) the name of any person-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 30Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
(i) is, without sufficient cause, entered in the register of members of a company, or
(ii) after having been entered in the register, is, without sufficient cause, omitted
there from; or
(b) default is made, or unnecessary delay takes place, in entering in the register the
fact of any person having become, or ceased to be, a member including a refusal
under Sub-section (1).
the person aggrieved, or any member of the company, or the company, may apply to the Company
Law Board for rectification of the register.
53. Core area of the submission made by Shri Shanti Bhushan was that since a time limit was
prescribed under Section 111(3), it would be inappropriate to give same right as under Section 111(2)
to be agitated under Section 111(4). Submission was that right under Section 111(4) had to be one of
a consequential nature i.e. where the aggrieved person had already got a verdict in his favor and the
company still delayed effecting the transfer.
54. One does appreciate the soundness of the proposition canvassed by Shri Shanti Bhushan that if
in one section there are two provisions- one fixing a time limit and the other without any time limit,
and if both are held applicable in a given situation, then it would make the provision fixing a time
limit redundant, but submission of Shri C.S. Sundaram pertaining to harmonious interpretation of
statutes before and after and amendment are equally forceful.
55. As noted above, legal view was unanimous that remedies available under Section 111 and 155
were alternative remedies. The only question which arises for consideration is whether while
assimilating Section 155 in Section 111 consequent to the 1988 amendment, there is any change in
the legal position.
56. Maxwell's Interpretation of Statutues (Tenth Edition Page 81) has the following passage :
Presumption against implicit alteration of law: One of these presumptions is that the
legislature does not intend to make any substantial alteration in the law beyond what
it explicitly declares, either in express terms or by clear implication, or, in other
words, beyond the immediate scope and object of the statute. In all general matters,
outside those limits, the law remains undisturbed. It is in the last degree improbable
that the legislature would overthrow fundamental principles, infringe rights, or
depart from the general system of law without expressing its intention with
irresistible clearness.
57. In Cricket Club of India v. Madhav L. Apte (1975) 45 Comp Case 574(Bom), the four principles of
interpretation were set out as follows :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 31Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
(1) There is presumption against the alteration of well settled law by implication and
such a change should be either by explicit or express words or only if such inference
of alteration is irresistible.
(2) If the matter is evenly balanced or fairly arguable on either side, then that
interpretation should be preferred which would involve the least alteration of the
existing law.
(3) If one of the two possible constructions would lead to startling or bizzare results,
or to any absurd or harsh consequences, then that construction is one which ought
not to be preferred and is one which ought to be avoided.
(4) The intention of the legislature is primarily to be gathered from the actual words
used and not from any words not to be found in the statute, but which are required to
be added to make the statute clear and to bring out the policy intention.
58. In Dr. Mrs. Sushma Sharma v. State of Rajasthan Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the principle
that when a legislative enactment has received authoritative interpretation whether by judicial
decision or by a long course of practice is again adopted in the framing of a later statute, it is sound
rule of construction to hold that the words so adopted were intended by the legislature to bear the
meaning which has been so put upon them. The court said :
It was observed by Lord Scarman in the case of R v. Chard (1984) AC 279, at p.295,
that the theory which was noted hereinbefore was not a canon of construction of
absolute obligation, but only a presumption in the circumstances to be taken in
judicial interpretation. This proposition, according to Lord Scarman, is well settled.
59. In Keshavji Raviji and Co. v. CIT , the contention was that where the meaning of a word used in a
statute had been judicially ascertained by a court and where the legislature where re-enacting the
law on the subject uses the same word, it must be taken to have been aware of the meaning so
judicially ascertained earlier and no to have used the word with a different content. Acknowledging
the fact that the principle was a well recognised guide to construction, however the Court held that
there were limitations to its application. The Court said : The rules of interpretation are not rules of
law; they are mere aids to construction and constitute some broad-pointers. The interpretative
criteria apposite in a given situation may, by themselves, be mutually irreconcilable.
It is the task of the court to decide which one, in the light of all relevant circumstances, ought to
prevail. The rules of interpretation are useful servants, but quite often tend to become difficult
masters.
60. Task therefore is to find out whether at the time when Section 155(1) was assimilated in Section
111(4), did the legislature intend, remedy under Section 111(4) as limited to what was contended by
Shri Shanti Bhushan i.e. a remedy to enforce a decision already existing in favor of the transferee.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 32Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
61. Bare perusal of Section 111(4) shows that it is practically a reproduction of the erstwhile Section
155(1) except to the addition of words 'including a refusal under Sub-section (1)' and substitution of
the words 'Company Law Board' for the word 'court'.
62. The term 'having become a member' had been judicially interpreted to mean 'any person having
become entitled to be a member' or 'any person having got the right of membership'. Therefore, a
transferee who has a valid instrument of transfer is one who is entitled to become a member and not
necessarily one who has obtained an order from a court or CLB. The position of a transferee coming
to courts under erstwhile Section 155 was well recognised. I find no change in this legal position,
post amendment, save and except forum is now CLB.
63. Refusal under Section 111(1) is appealable under Sub-Section 2. It is also actionable under
Clause 'b' of Sub Section 4. The words 'including a refusal under Sub-section (1)' in the last line of
Clause 'b' of Sub Section 4 makes it clear that refusal to lodge a transfer is actionable under Sub
Section 4. Refusal is clearly actionable under Sub Section 2. Howsoever sound and logical may be
the submission made by Shri Shanti Bhushan that, if in one section, there are two provisions - one
fixing a time limit and the other without fixing a time limit, and if both are applicable in a given
situation, then it would make the provision fixing a time limit redundant. However, the legal
position is as it is, it must be held that the petition filed by the respondent was clearly maintainable
under Section 111(4) and hence suffered no bar of limitation.
64. In para 34 above, I have noted the relevant terms of the letters of allotment. In paras 35 to 38
above I have noted Sections 2(12), 82 and 108 of the Companies Act, 1956 and Section 2(7) of the
Sale of Goods Act, 1930. In para 39 above, I have noted Govt. of India's Notification No. GSR: 1294
(E) dated 17.12.1986. Since appellant is a Government Company, in paras 40 to 42 above I have held
that in view of the Notification No: GSR: 1294 (E) and the sections noted above, the instant letters of
allotment stand at par with bonds and are hence goods as defined under the Sale of Goods Act, 1930.
65. Assuming that a letter of allotment is not goods but is a document of title to goods, what would
be the legal consequences 66. Section 2(4) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 defines a 'document of title
to goods' as under :
(4) document of title to goods? includes a bill of lading, dock-warrant, warehouse
keeper's certificate, wharfingers' certificate, railway receipt, multimodal transport
document, warrant or order for the delivery of goods and any other document used in
the ordinary course of business as proof of the possession or control of goods, or
authorising or purporting to authorise, either by endorsement or by delivery, the
possessor of the document to transfer or receive goods thereby represented ;
67. Section 53 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 reads as under:-
Effect of sub-sale or pledge by buyer.-(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, the
unpaid seller's right of lien or stoppage in transit is not affected by any sale or other
disposition of the goods which the buyer may have made, unless the seller has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 33Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
assented thereto:
Provided that where a document of title to goods has been issued, or lawfully
transferred to any person as buyer or owner of the goods, and that person transfers
the document to a person who takes the document in good faith and for
consideration, then, if such last mentioned transfer was by way of sale, the unpaid
seller's right of lien or stoppage in transit is defeated, and, if such last mentioned
transfer was by way of pledge or other disposition for value, the unpaid seller's right
of lien or stoppage in transit can only be exercised subject to the rights of the
transferee.
(2) Where the transfer is by way of pledge, the unpaid seller may require the pledgee
to have the amount secured by the pledge satisfied in the first instance, as far as
possible, out of any other goods or securities of the buyer in the hands of the pledgee
and available against the buyer.
68. As per definition of documents of title to goods a warrant or order for delivery of goods or any
other document used in the ordinary course of business as proof of possession or control of goods or
authorising either by endorsement or by delivery, the possessor of the document to receive goods is
a document of title to goods. Bonds are goods was not disputed by Shri Shanti Bhushan. The instant
letters of allotment authorise the holder to get the bonds. So viewed, the letters of allotment may be
classified as documents of title to the goods. Proviso to Section 53 of the Sale of Goods Act 1930
would come into play if the transferee takes the document of title in good faith and for
consideration. If seller is unpaid, he loses unpaid seller's lien.
69. Decision reported as 1876 (1) AC 476 T. Robins Goodwin v. Henry Christopher Robarts and Ors.
may be referred to at this stage. Action of trover, with a count for money to recover the value of a
scrip was in issue. In the words of Lord Cairns facts were as under :
Part of the scrip in question was scrip of a Russian Government loan. Each scrip note
was for 100 Pounds, and represented that when the Installments in which the 100
Pounds were to be advanced, were all paid up, the bearer would be, after receipt
thereof by Messrs. Rothschild, entitled to receive a definitive bond, or bonds for 100
Pounds from the Imperial Government. The 100 Pounds were to bear interest from
the 1st of December, 1873, and a coupon was attached to the scrip as a warrant for the
payment of the half-year's interest due on the 1st of June, 1874. The other scrip
related to an Austrian or Hungarian loan, and was in substance in the same form,
except that although the interest began to run from the 1st of December, 1873, there
was no coupon for the payment of the first half-year's interest. On all the scrip all the
installments were fully paid up before the Plaintiff became owner of the scrip. The
receipts for the installments were signed by the house of Rothschilds, but it was not
seriously disputed in the argument that Rothschilds acted merely as agents for the
foreign Governments, and that any liability which existed on the scrip was the
liability of the foreign Governments, and not of Rothschilds. The appellant bought
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 34Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
the scrip on the London Stock Exchange, through Clayton, his broker. At the time he
bought it, the instruments, as I have already said, were fully paid up; that is to say,
the whole amount represented by the scrip had been advanced to the foreign
governments; and the scrip receipts represented, upon the face of them, that the
bearer, whoever he might be, would be entitled to receive the bonds of the foreign
government for the amount of the scrip.
70. It was held:
The Plaintiff bought in the market scrip which, from the form in which it is prepared,
virtually represented that the paper would pass from hand to hand by delivery only,
and that any one who became bona fide the holder might claim for his own benefit
the fulfilllment of tis terms from the foreign Government. The Appellant might have
kept this scrip in his own possession, and, if he had done so, no question like the
present could have arisen. He preferred, however, to place it in the possession, and
under the control, of his broker or agent, and although it is stated that it remained in
the agent's hands for disposal or to be exchanged for the bonds when issued, as the
Appellant should direct, those into whose hands the scrip would come could know
nothing of the title of the Appellant, or of any private instructions he might have
given to his agent. The scrip itself would be a representation to any one taking it-a
representation which the Appellant must be taken to have made, or to have been a
party to- that if the scrip were taken in good faith, and for value, the person taking it
would stand to all intents and purposes in the place of the previous holder. Let it be
assumed, for the moment, that the instrument was not negotiable, that no right of
action was transferred by the delivery ; and that no legal claim could be made by the
taker in his own name against the foreign Government; still the Appellant is in the
position of a person who has made a representation, on the face of his scrip, that it
would pass with a good title to any one on his taking it in good faith and for value,
and who has put it in the power of his agent to hand over the scrip with this
representation to those who are induced to alter their position on the faith of the
representation so made.
My Lords, I am of the opinion that on doctrines were established, of which Pickard v.
Sears (1) may be taken to an example, the Appellant cannot be allowed to defeat the
title which the Respondents have thus acquired.
x x x But it was contended that the scrip was at most a promise to give a bond, and
not a promise to pay money, and therefore was not a security for the payment of
money. In my opinion it is impossible to maintain this distinction. The whole sum of
100 Pounds had been actually advanced and paid; the loan was carrying interest from
the 1st of the previous December; there was nothing more remaining to be done on
the part of the holder of the scrip; and if any such holder had been asked what
security he had for the advance which had been made, he would unhesitatingly have
pointed to the scrip. Under these circumstances I cannot regard the scrip as playing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 35Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
any different part from a bond, and the statement in paragraph 9 of the Case,
carrying the custom as to negotiability of scrip quite as high as the evidence stating
the custom in Gorgier v. Mieville (1) as to bonds, I am clearly of opinion that we
ought to hold, in this case, that this scrip was negotiable, and that any person taking
it in good faith obtained a title to it independent of the title of the person from whom
he took it.
71. In a concurring decision, Lord Hatherley observed :
Now it is also found in the Case that these instruments are taken as securities and
pass from hand to hand as such. Here is a gentleman in possession of a document,
which on the face of it entitles the holder to receive another document of a different
character, a bond instead of scrip, upon the mere presentation by him of that scrip as
holder. He knows that if he places this document in the hands of a broker, that broker
if he should be told to dispose of it, would dispose of it by simply handing over the
scrip as it had been handed to him for his client, the Appellant, when the Appellant
became entitled to it. The person buying of his broker would not be expected to ask,
and would not necessarily ask, according to the course of business and dealing in the
market, any question as to how the scrip had been acquired, or what the title of the
previous holder of it had been. The Appellant, therefore, gives the broker scrip which
is, and for the last fifty years has been, disposed of every day in the market, and has,
for all those years, been so disposed of, upon the sole presentation by the holder, the
seller, or pledger, to the person to whom he wishes to sell or to pledge it, and that
without any suspicion being aroused to suggest the necessity, or even the propriety,
of asking a single other question. Can a person who, himself, in that manner acquired
the instrument, who knows that as long as he has it safe in his pocket, in his box, or in
his desk, he can rely upon that instrument, but that as soon as he parts with it the
new holder will, as he did, become in a position to claim those bonds which he
himself might have claimed if he had retained possession of the scrip-can he, placing
it in the hands of a broker with no instructions whatever except to dispose of it as he
may direct-can he, according to the principle of the cases which were referred to in
the course of the argument with regard to limited agency, when on the face of it that
which constitutes, you may say, the authority of the agent, namely, the possession of
the document, appears to be sufficient alone for obtaining the bonds in question? I
agree with my noble and learned friend on the woolsack in thinking that this case
might by disposed of upon that ground alone.
72. The distinction sought to be drawn by Shri Shanti Bhushan that scrip dealt with in T. Robins
Goodwin's case was a bearer scrip and instant letters of allotment are in favor of a named person is
of no consequence as the letters of allotment were transferable by endorsement. Is not a promisor
note equally effective in the hands of the original promiseor the holder in due course? Of course, it
is.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 36Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
73. In the report published as (1877) 2 Q.B. 194 Rumball v. The Metropolitan Bank facts were that
scrip certificates, by which it was certified that, after the payment of certain Installments, the bearer
thereof would be entitled to be registered as the holder of shares in a banking company, were issued
to the plaintiff, and by him deposited with a stockbroker for the purposes of paying the Installments
remaining due, and dealing with the scrips as the plaintiff would direct. The broker in fraud of the
plaintiff, and without his authority, deposited the script with the defendants as security for an
amount due from him i.e. the broker to the defendants. This fraud was not known to the defendants.
It was proved that the scrips were treated as negotiable instruments transferable by mere delivery. It
was held :
The first question which presents itself is, whether the present case falls within the
principle of the decision in Goodwin v. Robarts, as decided in the Court of Exchequer
Chamber (1), and in the House of Lords on appeal (2); and we think it does, both with
reference to the usage of the monetary world in respect of such certificates, which
brings the case within the principle of the decision of the Court of Exchequer
Chamber-which principled was affirmed by the Lord Chancellor in the House of
Lords-and also on the other ground on which the decision of the House of Lords
proceeded, namely, that if a party possessed of a security purporting on the fact of it
to be transferable by delivery chooses to leave such security in the hands of a third
party, and the latter makes it over to a bona fide holder for value, the true owner
must be taken to have brought about his own loss, and cannot recover it back.
74. Letters of allotment in question carry an endorsement that it is a valuable document and should
be preserved carefully for exchange with the Bond Certifcate(s). It also carries an endorsement that
amount stands paid up. Any purchaser would be justified in presuming that the bonds were fully
paid for. Be that as it may, if a document is transferable, restrictions have to be specified in the
document. I find none. It is also relevant to note that the letters of allotment shows that the name of
Canfina stands entered in the register of bond holders maintained by the appellant.
75. Document of title is right in the goods as distinct from a right to sue.
76. On the issue of Canbank Mutual Fund being a purchaser for consideration and when did title in
the letters of allotment pass from Canfina to the Fund; as per the two transfers were effected on
20.3.1992. Deal slips between the two and receipt issued by Canfina shows money was paid by the
Fund to Canfina on 20.3.1992.
77. Section 19 of the Sale of Goods Act 1930 states as under:-
19. Property passes when intended to pass.-(1) Where there is a contract for the sale
of specific or ascertained goods the property in them is transferred to the buyer at
any such time as the parties to the contract intend it to be transferred.
(2) For the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the parties regard shall be had to the terms of
the contract, the conduct of the parties and the circumstances of the case.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 37Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
(3) Unless a different intention appears, the rules contained in Sections 20 to 24 are rules for
ascertaining the intention of the parties as to the time at which the property in the goods is to pass
to the buyer.
78. Section 20 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 reads as under:-
20. Specific goods in a deliverable state.- Where there is an unconditional contract
for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state, the property in the goods passes to
the buyer when the contract is made, and it is immaterial whether the time of
payment of the price of the time of delivery of the goods, or both, is postponed.
79. Sub-Section 3 of Section 4 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 reads as under:
(3) Where under a contract of sale the property in the goods is transferred from the
seller to the buyer, the contract is called a sale, but where the transfer of the property
in the goods is to take place at a future time or subject to some condition thereafter to
be fulfillled, the contract is called an agreement to sell.
80. There is no dispute between Canfina and the Fund that the transfer took place on 20.3.1992. It is
clear from a bare reading of Section 19 of the Sale of Goods Act 1930 that property in goods passes
when the parties intend it to pass. Under Section 20 if there is an unconditional contract for sale of
specified goods in a deliverable state the property in the goods passes to the buyer when the contract
is made and it is immaterial whether the time of payment of the price or the time of delivery of the
goods, or both, is postponed. (See Agricultural Marketing Committee v. Shalimar Chemcial Works
Ltd.)
81. It is clear from Section 4(3) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 that only when the transfer of
property is to take place at a future time or subject to some conditions to be fulfillled is the contract
an agreement to sell. There is no condition to be fulfillled by Canfina or the Fund nor is there any
material to show that parties intended that property would pass at a future date.
82. Bona fide purchaser of goods has to be understood in the context of whether the buyer had
notice of defect in the title of the seller in the goods. As held above, Canfina acquired good title to
the letters of allotment on 10.3.1992. There being no defect in title, question of the Fund buying the
letters of allotment not in good faith does not arise.
83. Appellant parted with the letters of allotment when delivery was made to Canfina. Delivery being
a fact, statutory results must follow. Rs. 60 crores invested by the appellant with Canfina in the
portfolio management scheme had to be returned after 1 year. Default in repayment had to be on
10.1.1993. Assuming consideration failed, what happens?
84. In the report published as 1926 Vol 94 1.C.824 (PC) Maneckji Pestanji Bharucha and Anr. v.
Wadilal Sarabhai and Co. facts were that Plaintiff sold certain shares of Company to defendant No.
1. He took from various brokers blank transfers signed by the registered holders along with
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 38Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
corresponding certificates and handed them over to the defendant No. 1. The defendant No. 1 gave
the plaintiff a cheque which was dishonoured. The defendant No. 1 made certain propositions as to
the raising of money with defendant No. 2 and handed the certificates and transfers to him.
Defendant No. 2 did likewise with defendant No. 3.
85. In an action by the plaintiff against the defendants it was held, that as soon as the plaintiff
handed over the certificates and transfers and the defendant accepted them and gave a cheque,
property in the shares passed to the defendant No. 1 and the plaintiff had neither had any jus in re of
the certificates and transfers nor he had any statutory lien on them. The plaintiff could only sue the
defendant No. 1 on the cheque or on the price of the shares unpaid in respect that the cheque had
not been honoured and could not sue defendants Nos. 2 and 3 for delivery of shares.
86. In the report published as AIR 1943 (30) Nagpur 249 E.C. Eduljee v. John Bros.(Proprietor S.V.
Azavedo), the facts were that the plaintiff-respondent Azavedo purchased second-hand refrigerator
for Rs. 120 and, it was agreed between him and the appellant vendor E.C. Eduljee that the
refrigerator should be put in order at a cost of Rs. 320. The respondent purchaser took delivery on
20th February, 1937 and admitted that its condition was satisfactory. Later, he said that it was not in
working order and the appellant took away two parts of it for further repairs, the thermostat and the
engine. The full bill for repairs had not however been paid and the defendant-appellant Eduljee
refused to return the parts taken for repairs until he was paid a balance of Rs. 70 due for the original
repairs.
87. It was held that when the contract was fully performed and when the goods were handed back
(although the cost of the repairs had not been fully paid), the lien was ended and it could not be
revived because the purchaser undertook further repairs.
88. Section 49 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 reads as under:-
49.Termination of lien.- (1) The unpaid seller of goods loses his lien thereon-
(a) when he delivers the goods to a carrier or other bailee for the purpose of
transmission to the buyer without reserving the right of disposal of the goods ;
(b) when the buyer or his agent lawfully obtains possession of the goods ;
(c) by waiver thereof.
(2) The unpaid seller of goods, having a lien thereon, does not lose his lien by reason
only that he has obtained a decree for the price of the goods.
89. Letters of allotment being lawfully parted with in March, 1992, PGCIL can under no
circumstances claim unpaid sellers lien.
90. Was PGCIL an unpaid seller? If not, the whole controversy becomes a non-issue.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 39Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
91. As held by their Lordships of the Supreme Court in the decision reported as J and K Bank Ltd. v.
Attar Ul Nissa and Ors. as soon as money is credited into an account, consideration is paid.
92. As per composite contract terms whereof are contained in PGCIL's letter dated 9.3.1992
consideration had to be paid by Canfina by depositing the sum of Rs. 80 crores in an account to be
opened in name of PGCIL with Canara Bank, Janpath Branch. Admittedly, on 10.3.1992 account of
PGCIL with Canara Bank, Janpath Branch was credited in said sum. Thus consideration passed. 2nd
part of the composite contract required Rs. 3.2 crores to be paid by PGCIL to Canfina as 4% fee on
bonds worth Rs. 80 crores, Rs. 16.8 crores to be invested with Canfina at interest @ 11% and Rs. 60
crores to be invested in the portfolio management scheme of Canfina. Thus Rs. 3.2 crores + Rs. 16.8
crores and Rs. 60 crores had to be debited from account of PGCIL and credited to that of Canfina.
This was done. It cannot therefore be said that the bonds were not paid for. It was for said reason
that the letters of allotment recorded that the bonds were fully paid for.
93. Appellant cannot claim unpaid sellers lien.
94. I may note a submission made by Shri Shanti Bhushan that no payment was made by the Fund
to Canfina as the cheque towards the consideration was issued by the Fund in name of Canara Bank
and not Canfina.
95. In the petition before CLB in para 5(a) it was specifically averred by the respondent as under:
(a) On or around 20th March, 1992 the said Fund had purchased in its Cantriple
Scheme 17 percent Power Grid Corporation Bonds of the face value of Rs.80 crore
from Canbank Financial Services Ltd.(hereinafter referred to as Canfina). The
consideration in respect of the said bonds was paid by the Petitioners by way of R.B.I.
Cheque No. 22001 drawn by the Fund in favor of Canara Bank for Rs.
102,67,67,123.28 which includes the cost of 17% Power Grid Corporation bonds for
Rs. 80 crores @ Rs. 97/- - Rs. 77,97,26,027.39 and the Cost of 17% MTNL bonds for
Rs. 25 crore @ Rs. 97/-- Rs. 24,70,41,095.89.
96. Appellant's reply before CLB was as under:
5(a) Para 5 (a) of the Petition states that the Petitioner had purchased the bonds (17%
taxable) of the face value of Rs. 80 crores from CANFINA on or around 20.03.92.
This is not feasible since as per the terms of the composite contract between the
Respondent Corporation and CANFINA vide letter No.NPTC/Cos/Bonds/50106
dated 9/10.3.92, CANFINA was allotted Bonds (17% taxable) of the face value of Rs.
80 crores only out of which 20% were to be sold to the public over the counter. Hence
the CANFINA could not sell all the bonds of face value of Rs. 80 crores to the
Petitioner as alleged. It is also pertinent to note that Citi Bank NA claims to have
purchased the same very bonds (17 taxable) of the face value of Rs. 30 crores on
5.5.1992 from CANFINA. The Petitioner has not submitted any documents/contract
of sale to establish the transfer of bonds of face value of Rs. 80 crores in its favor by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1577520/ 40Power Grid Corporation Of India Ltd. vs Canara Bank on 17 April, 2006
CANFINA on or about 20.03.1992.
97. There is no specific denial to respondent's pleadings in para 5(a) of the petition. Appellant
cannot set up pleas of facts for the first time in the present appeal. Be that as it may, Shri C.S.
Sundaram, learned senior counsel for the respondent explained that in financial circles, all banking
and financial institutions have accounts with the RBI and payment by RBI cheque is a very common
practice followed by Banks and Financial Institutions in securities market in order to facilitate
speedy transfer of funds (on the same day). While the Mutual Fund and Canara Bank have RBI
account, Canfina, being a non-banking financial institution does not have an RBI account. Instead
Canfina has an account with Canara Bank, Cunningham Road, Bangalore. It was in such
circumstances that the sale consideration for the LOA's in question was first given to Canara Bank
which in turn has credited the proceeds to Canfina's account. It was only pursuant to such receipt of
money that Canfina issued the receipts evidencing payment by the Mutual Fund.
98. Appellants submissions based on Sub-section 2 and 4 of Section 3 of the Capital Issues (Control)
Act 1947 may be dealt with. It was urged that as per said provisions the Government was
empowered to lay down terms under which securities could be offered for sale and that in the
instant case approval granted by Central Government vide letter dated 7.2.1992 made it a condition
that PGCIL would be subject to the measures of control that may be brought into operation by the
Central Government. That on 22.6.1992 Central Government directed PGCIL not to part with the
bonds till money was actually received. That on 9.11.1993 PGCIL amended its Articles of Association
empowering the Board to forfeit the bonds.
99. Sub-section 4 of Section 3 of the Capital Issues (Control) Act 1947 reads as under:-
The Central Government may qualify any consent or recognition accorded by it under
Sub-section (2) or Sub-section (3) with such conditions, whether for immediate or
future fulfilllment, as it may think fit to impose; and where a company acts in
pursuance of such consent or recognition, it shall comply with the terms of any
condition so imposed.
100. Condition imposed vide letter dated 7.2.1992 has been noted by me in para 1 above. The
condition is that PGCIL will be subject to any measure of control, licensing or acquisition that may
be brought into operation by the Government. Prima-facie read, the term of the condition cannot
mean that the Central Government directives, in relation to contracted obligation of PGCIL, can be
issued to vary the terms of a contract. But I chose to decide the issue on different grounds. Central
Government's letter dated 22.6.1992 required PGCIL to receive Rs. 60 crores before parting with the
bonds. But sale of letters of allotment to the respondent by Canfina had taken place on 20.3.1992.
Third party rights had intervened. These could not be put to naught. Besides, as already held in para
91 above, consideration stands paid as soon money is credited into an account. Admitted account of
PGCIL with Canara Bank, Janpath Branch was credited on 10.3.1992. Money passed on from
Canfina to PGCIL.

101. In the report published as 1992 (73) Company Cases 80, Mathrubhumi Printing and Publishing
Co. Ltd. v. Vardhaman Publishers Ltd. and Ors. passage from the decision of the Madras High Court
reported as 1988 Writ LR 41, Swaminathan (M.U.) v. Chairman and Managing Director and IDCO
was cited with concurrence. The same reads as under:-
Section 31(2) of the Companies Act cannot be understood to mean that any alteration
made in the articles of association would have retrospective effect as if it was there
from the inception of the articles of association. The section is intended only to confer
validity on the alteration made to the articles. It is only for the limited purpose of
making the alteration valid it is to be treated as it it was originally in the articles. It is
seen from Sections 29 and 30 of the Companies Act that certain formalities are
prescribed for articles of association. Unless the requirements of Section 29 and 30
are satisfied, the articles of association will not be valid in law. If the same formalities
are to be gone through whenever any alteration is made, it may lead to several
difficulties. For example, Section 30(c) of the Companies Act requires the articles to
be signed by each subscriber of the Memorandum of Association. If an alteration to
the articles is also to be signed by all the subscribers to the memorandum of
association, it may not be possible at all. In order to avoid such a situation, Section
31(2) of the Act provides that the alteration made in accordance with Section 31(1)
shall be valid as if it was part of the original articles. It is only for this limited purpose
that the legal fiction is introduced by the said Section. We cannot extend the scope of
the fiction so as to make the alteration itself retrospective in effect for all purposes.
102. Controversy raised by the appellant that knowledge of Canfina is knowledge of the Fund as
both operated under the umbrella of Canara Bank is neither here nor there for the reason as of
20.3.1992 neither existed the letter dated 2.6.1992 of the Central Government nor existed the
controversy of interpreting the agreement between the parties. As of that date the appellant treated
the sum of Rs. 60 crores as paid to it.
103. Before concluding, I may note that even after 2.6.1992, the appellant did not demand the sum
of Rs. 60 crores from Canfina. Evidenced by letters dated 23.9.1992 (noted in para 17 above) and
letter dated 22.10.1992 (noted in para 18 above), appellant wanted an assurance that its money was
safe in the hands of Canfina and would be returned in March 1993 with interest @ 12% per annum.
The 2 letters show that the appellant treated the sum of Rs. 60 crores as paid to it at the first
instance and thereafter appropriated by Canfina (in the Portfolio Management Scheme). As regards
insistence of the appellant that Canfina should assure repayment within interest @ 12% per annum,
the same was baseless as at no point of time Canfina agreed to pay interest @12% per annum.
Appellant knew that the sum of Rs. 60 crores was invested in the portfolio management scheme and
therefore would earn the dividend depending upon how the stocks purchased in the portfolio
management scheme failed. The 12% return referred to by Canfina was only an indicative return. In
the letter dated 23.9.1992 and 22.10.1992, appellant itself (in the first para of the letters) referred
that 12% interest was the indicative interest.
104. The Appeal is dismissed.
