TWELVE ORAL ORDER: (Per Honble Sri Justice D. Appa Rao, President) ***
1) These complaints are filed by different complainants against MAYTAS (herein after called the
developer) praying to direct the developer to hand over the finished flats under sale by executing
registered sale deeds or in the alternative refund the sale consideration with interest, besides
penalty amount @ Rs. 5/- per sft of the super built up area together compensation and costs and
also against ICICI bank (herein after called the bank) for refund of the amount disbursed by the
bank to the developer together with penal interest and credit into their loan account etc. u/s 17 of
the Consumer Protection Act.
2) Since common questions of fact and law are involved in all these complaints, and against the
same opposite parties, we are of the opinion that they can be disposed of by a common order.

apartments situated in Sy192/P to 198/P, 201/P and 282/P at Bachupally of Qutubullapur Mandal,

agreed to grant loan and pay the amount to the developer as per the tripartite agreement executed in
this regard between them. Accordingly the complainants had paid initial amount booking and
allotment advance etc. and the bank in turn had sanctioned and disbursed the loan amount to the
developer. The developer executed registered sale deeds in favour of some of the complainants in
respect of undivided share of land together with unfinished structure.
(3.1) It was agreed that the construction was to be completed within a year with a grace period of
three months, and in some cases 20 months. While so, on 7.1.2009, founder of M/s.
Satyam Computer Services Ltd. Sri Ramalinga Raju confessed that he had diverted the founds from
developer to computer services and therefore there could be delay in completion of the project. On
that developer sent a notice calling upon them to attend meeting on 25.3.2009. In fact, it cannot
collect more than 20% towards advance as per Section 5 of the Andhra Pradesh Apartments
(Promotion of Construction and Ownership) Act, 1987. It did not even file the declaration u/s 4 of
the said Act. The bank even did not insist on the developer for adhering to the agreement under the
provisions of above Act. The bank had disbursed the entire amount without any physical verification
or valuation by a valuer contrary to the agreement and tripartite agreement. The developer was
guilty in not completing the construction within the time stipulated, and diverting the funds. It had
abruptly abandoned the construction. There were criminal proceedings initiated against the
directors. They were even convicted by the Special Judge for Economic Offences for not filing profit
and loss account, balance sheet before the Registrar of Companies.
Virtually the developer is non-existent as per the balance sheet of the year 2008-2009. By virtue of
directions of the Honble High Court in Company Petition No. 172/2011 it had submitted its net
worth as zero and it has accumulated loss of Rs. 538 crores. In addition to that there is an award
against the developer for Rs. 600 crores together with interest at Rs. 221 crores. In fact it had
advanced loans of Rs. 247 crores to its subsidiary companies, recovery of which was doubtful. All
this has created in mental agony to them. They were forced to pay EMIs on the loans borrowed.
Therefore the complainants are filed for the above mentioned reliefs.
4) The developer filed counter resisting the claim. It admitted that it is a limited company
incorporated under the provisions of Companies Act inter-alia engaged in the business of
construction. It alleged that it started a venture, under the name and style Maytas Hill County along
with other opposite parties. They entered into an agreements of sale on various dates agreeing to sell
flats as alleged in the complaints for the consideration mentioned therein excluding stamp duty,
registration fee, VAT, service tax etc. The project was commenced as per the schedule. However, on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21465778/ 15Srinivas Gunti vs Maytas Hill County Pvt. Ltd. on 27 April, 2012
a wholly incorrect understanding of its association with Mr. B. Ramalinga Raju, various
investigations and proceedings were instituted against it. The private financial institutions which
had committed funding withdrew from the project causing serious shortage of funds, jeopardizing
the further development of the project. The delay in completion of the project was due to force
majeure which is beyond its control. There was no deficiency in service on its part. Later on account
of various steps taken by it 140 independent houses were constructed and delivered possession and
172 independent houses are in final stages. It had also undertaken to complete the construction of
flats. It was fully committed to complete the project and deliver the same to the complainants. Its
case was also referred to Company Law Board. It has appointed SBI Capital Markets Ltd. (SBI Cap)
as transaction advisor. The entire process was entrusted to Justice A. R. Laxmanan former judge of
Supreme Court of India. The Company Law Board on 13.1.2011 passed an order inducting M/s.
Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd., M/s. IL&FS Financial Services Ltd. and M/s. IL &
FS Engineering and Construction Company Ltd., into the company as shareholders by allotting
preferential shares. Pursuant to which the Board of Directors are re-constituted. They have initiated
various measures. It is in the process of arranging further infusion of funds in order to complete the
project. The agreement stipulates arbitration clause wherein the disputes would be referred to an
arbitrator. It did neither commit any breach nor commit any offence as alleged in the complaint. In
view of various judgements and court orders the project was delayed. In fact it had invoked the
arbitration clause and referred the matter to an arbitrator Honble Justice V. Bhaskar Rao for
adjudication. The complainants were not entitled to any of the amounts. Therefore it prayed for
dismissal of the complaints with costs.
5) The directors of the developer filed a memo adopting the counter filed by it.
6) The bank filed counter resisting the case. The complainants have approached the bank for
availing loan for purchase of flats and they entered into agreement of sale with the developer. Basing
on the application and income profile of the complainants and the agreement of sale entered into
between the complainants and the developer it (the bank) had agreed to sanction loan as per the
norms. The complainants, developer and the bank entered into a tripartite agreement and as per the
terms it had disbursed the loan amount directly to the developer on behalf of complainants as per
the agreed terms basing on the disbursal request form submitted by the complainants. The tripartite
agreement enables the bank to review the progress of construction to protect its own interest and
not a duty cast on it. The complainants cannot stop payment of EMIs on the ground that the
developer failed to complete the construction/hand over possession of the flats. The tripartite
agreement specifically stipulates that the developer and the borrower hereby declare and undertake
to keep the bank indemnified, saved and kept harmless from or against risk that might arise on
account of any defect in the title to the property. Claim or demand being made on such property or
incomplete construction/development work by the developer and in the even the bank suffers any
claim, risk, damage etc. the borrower and the developer shall jointly undertake to forthwith
reimburse/refund the amount of any such claim, demand, damage risk etc. together with interest,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21465778/ 16Srinivas Gunti vs Maytas Hill County Pvt. Ltd. on 27 April, 2012
penalty etc., and the developer had undertaken to reimburse/refund the principal amount to the
bank. As per the indemnity clause the complainants and the developer are jointly liable for
repayment of loan amount. They are estopped from making any claims in the light terms of
tripartite agreement. There was no deficiency in service on its part nor adopted any unfair trade
practise. The complainants filed these false cases in order to avoid repayment of loan amount and
make wrongful gain. Therefore it prayed for dismissal of the complaints with costs.
7) Both parties filed their affidavit evidence and got the documents marked.
8) The points that arise for consideration are :
i.
Whether the complainants are entitled for possession and registration of flats or in the alternative
refund of the amount, if so, to what amount?
ii.
Whether the bank was justified in releasing the entire amount, contrary to the terms of agreements?
iii. Whether the complainants are entitled to compensation?
iv. To what relief?
9) It is an undisputed fact that the complainants had booked the flats and paid sale consideration by
borrowing loans from the bank basing on a construction agreement entered into between the
complainants and the developer. The developer had agreed to complete the construction and hand
over possession within stipulated period from the date of execution of agreement. It also agreed to
pay Rs.5/- per sft. for the delayed construction up to a maximum of 8 months. Pursuant to the above
agreements of sale, tripartite agreements are also entered into between the developer, complainants
and bank where the bank undertook to disburse the loan amount to the builder as agreed upon.
10) Unfortunately the developer stopped the construction and it has come to stand still, when
Satyam group of companies in which developer is one of the constituent company went into
liquidation. The complainants, therefore, seek registration of the sale deeds, and possession of the
completed apartments or in the alternative refund of amounts or where sale deeds were executed, to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21465778/ 17Srinivas Gunti vs Maytas Hill County Pvt. Ltd. on 27 April, 2012
permit them to re-convey title to the developer together with interest, compensation and costs.
11) The developer resisted the complaints on the ground that the agreement provides for reference
to an Arbitrator in case of dispute and therefore the complaints are not maintainable before this
Commission.
12) We may state that the developer filed an application I.A.No.190/2011 and similar batch of
applications to dismiss the complaints on the ground that there is an arbitration clause contained in
the agreement. The said applications were dismissed holding that the Commission has jurisdiction
in the light of various decisions of the Apex Court. Aggrieved by the said order, the developer filed
W.P.Nos.27689/10 and batch. Their lordships of the High Court dismissed the Writ Petitions
upholding the order of this Commission. Therefore, we do not intend to once again consider the said
question. The developer is estopped from contending that by virtue of arbitration clause, this
Commission cannot proceed ahead for adjudicating the matters in the light of the above orders.
13) The developer raised another contention that by virtue of the orders of the Company Law Board
(CLB for short) 05-3-2009 and 13-1-2011, the complainants cannot seek relief before this
Commission and they have to approach the CLB for redressal. More over, it cannot be said to be
guilty of rendering deficiency in service.
14) Despite the fact that developer company is the party, it did not bring it to the notice of the
Company Law Board as to the various claims made by the complainants. Except stating that the
Maytas Hill Owners Association was a party to such order, there is no proof that the complainants
are parties to the said association or any notice was served on them individually in order to bind
them. In all fairness, the developer company ought to have impleaded the complainants as parties to
the above said proceedings.
15) The learned counsel for the complainants submitted that they learnt that the developer
represented before the CLB that all efforts would be taken up for completion of the project.
Evidently no construction activity has been taken up. Even otherwise they did not even start
construction as per the orders of CLB and arbitration. These facts are not disputed. The
complainants submitted that they have no hopes that the project would be completed within a
reasonable time so that they could wait for the project to be completed and then take possession of
the apartments. They insist that their amounts be refunded with interest, besides penalty @ Rs. 5/-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21465778/ 18Srinivas Gunti vs Maytas Hill County Pvt. Ltd. on 27 April, 2012
per sft as agreed upon together with compensation and costs.
16) The learned counsel for the developer contended that the order of the Company Law Board is
binding on the complainants and these complaints have to be necessarily dismissed with a direction
to approach the CLB. When the developer company originally run by Satyam Computer Services
Ltd. founded by Mr. B. Ramalinga Raju went into serious financial troubles and the allegation that
funds of Satyam were diverted to Maytas Properties to bail out from liquidation, the Central
Government filed Company Application No.4/2009 U/s.388 B, 397, 398, 402 and 403 of the
Companies Act before the Principal Bench of Company Law Board, New Delhi. In the said company
petition, directions were issued on 13-1-2011, directing Central Government to nominate a nominee
director on behalf of the CLB. The order discloses that Shri Ved Kumar Jain was nominated as
director on behalf of the CLB. The nominee director undertook various measures to put the project
back on track basing on the recommendations of Honble Justice A.R. Laxmanan.
The CLB order dt. 13-1-2011 reads as follows:
(i) I permit the induction of IL & FS group (consisting of Infrastructure Leasing &
Financial Services Limited (IL&FS). IL&FS Financial Services Limited (IFIN) and IL&FS
Engineering & Construction Company Limited (IECL) as the new promoter of MPL and permit
reconstitution of the Board of MPL as provided hereunder.
(ii) The IL &FS group shall invest Rs.20 lakhs in equity share capital of the MPL
whereupon its shareholding in MPL would become 80%.
(iii) The IL &FS group on induction as the strategic investor shall take-over the
management control of the MPL and reconstitute the Board of Directors of MPL as under:
a) There shall be 4 nominees of the IL &FS group as directors on the Board of MPL including the
Chairman.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21465778/ 19Srinivas Gunti vs Maytas Hill County Pvt. Ltd. on 27 April, 2012
b) The existing Directors of MPL, i.e., Mr.Rama Raju, Mr.D.Gopla Krishnam Raju and
Mr.D.Venkata Satya Subba Raju shall resign as Directors of MPL immediately on induction of
IL&FS group as the strategic investor in MPL.
c) Mr. Ved Jain , the nominee Director, appointed by the Union of India, Pursuant to the
directions contained in the order dt. 5.4.2009 shall continue as Director in MPL for a further period
of 3 years.
(iv). The IL &FS group shall mobilize funds of Rs.150 crores in MPL within a period of 3 months
from today.
(v) The IL&FS group shall complete the Maytas Hill Country Residential Project Phase-I within 18
months of its induction as promoter in MPL and shall arrange the required finances to complete the
project.
The order required the above said group to complete the project within 18 months. Pursuant to it,
the developer has been taken over by new inductives. It is not known as to the steps that are
initiated in compliance of the orders.
17) The learned counsel for the developer relied the following decisions for the proposition that this
Commission cannot go ahead and adjudicate the dispute in view of the above orders:
The supreme Court in Sangramsinh P.Gaekwad v.Shantadevi P.Gaekwad, reported in (2005) 123
Comp. Cas 566, held that Section 402 of the Companies Act, 1956 is without prejudice to the
generality of the powers of the Company Law Board under Section 397 & 398 and may provide for
directions to achieve the objects for which the above sections are enacted. These statutory powers
have been vested to administer justice and equity, giving broad discretion applying general standard
of fairness to meet the ends of justice.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21465778/ 20Srinivas Gunti vs Maytas Hill County Pvt. Ltd. on 27 April, 2012
In Manish Mohan Sharma v. Ram Bahadur Thakur, reported in AIR 2006 SC 1690, the Supreme
Court held that the powers under Section 402 are residuary in nature and in addition to the powers
available to the Company Law Board under Sections 397(2) and Section 398(2) which permit the
Company Law Board to make such order as it thinks fit with a view to bringing to an end the matters
complained under 397(1) and 398(1).
In Ravi Kiran Agarwal & Anr. v. Moolchand Shah & Ors., reported in [2009] 152 Comp Case 637
(Bom), it was held that there is no reason to confine the words any other person under section 405
to those categories of persons who are elucidated in clause (e) of Section 402. Further, it was also
held that the exercise of those wide powers, may in a given situation affect the interest of third
parties. The court opined that Section 402 describes the nature of reliefs that can be granted in a
petition under section 397 and 398. Clauses (a) to (g) of Section 402 are not exhaustive of the reliefs
that can be granted by the Board but are only illustrative of the wide powers that are granted upon
the Board with a view to ameliorating the situation of mismanagement and oppression.
In MSDC Radharaman v. MSD Chandrasekara Raja, reported in (2008) 6 SCC 750, the Supreme
Court held that the jurisdiction of the Company Law Board having been couched in wide terms and
as diverse reliefs can be granted by it to keep the company functioning, is it not desirable to pass an
order which for all intent and purport would be beneficial to the company itself and the majority of
the members? A court of law can hardly satisfy all the litigants before it. This however, by itself
would not mean that the Company Law Board would refuse to exercise its jurisdiction, although the
statute confers such a power on it.
In Starlinger & Co. v. Lohia Starlinger Ltd, reported in 2007 (5) ADJ 744, it was held that Clause
(g) of Section 402 has illustrated these extraordinary powers in which the Company Law Board may
provide for any other matter, which in the opinion of the Company Law Board is just and equitable.
In Bennett Coleman & Co. v.
Union of India, reported in (1997) 47 Comp Cas 92, it was held that instead of destroying the
corporate existence of a company, the Company Law Board has been enabled to continue its
corporate existence by passing such orders as it thinks fit in order to achieve the objective of
removing the oppression to any member or members of a company or to prevent the companys
affairs from being conducted in a manner prejudicial to public interest.

In India Household and Healthcare Ltd. v. LG Household and Healthcare Ltd., reported in (2007) 5
SCC 510, observed that the doctrine of comity or amity requires a court not to pass an order which
would be in conflict with another order passed by a competent court of law.
In Swadeshi Cotton Mills v Union of India, reported in (1978) 4 SCC 295, it was held that the
findings of CLB need to be respected by a Company Court and must not be interfered with unless
there is a glaring anomaly.
In Takshila Hospital Ltd. v. Dr.Jaganmohan Mathur, reported in [2003] 115 Com Cas 343 Raj, it was
held that an exercise of such option of instituting a proceedings under Section 397 & 398, an
independent proceeding came to be instituted which had to be proceeded with independently and
uninfluenced by other proceedings which have not even crossed the preliminary stage of admission.
In the very nature of the order passed by the learned company judge, the company petition for
winding up cannot now be proceeded with until proceedings under Section 397 are finally
culminated, which includes the exercise of rights of appeal by any party aggrieved with the order
passed by the CLB. Such appeal also lies to the High Court.
The decisions did not lay down any proposition that the proceedings before the consumer fora have
to be shelved or the complainants have to approach the CLB.
18) In fact the question whether the complainants have to approach the CLB or pursue their remedy
before this Commission is covered by a decision of our High Court in PRUDENTIAL CAPITAL
MARKETS Limited, Calcutta v. State of A.P. Department of Law reported in 2000 ALT-5-468. It
held as follows:
There are three categories of cases. The first category of cases are those where the depositor filed a
consumer dispute case before the competent District Forum for refund of the deposit made by the
depositor with the PRUDENTIAL CAPITAL MARKETS LIMITED (PCML for short) and on the
District Forum allowing the application, the petitioner herein approached the State Commission
which dismissed the appeal filed and whereupon the depositor approached District Forum under
Section 27(1) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 by filing penalty petition. The second category of
cases are those where the depositor filed a penalty petition before the District Forum for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21465778/ 22Srinivas Gunti vs Maytas Hill County Pvt. Ltd. on 27 April, 2012
implementation of the order in consumer dispute case and where the petitioner did not approach
the State Commission which is the appellate forum. The third category of cases are those where the
orders of the appellate forum are challenged by the petitioner.
In the process, the question whether CLB can only entertain the complaint against PCML has arisen.
While dealing with the said question the proceedings before CLB vis--vis the proceedings before
Consumer Forum have also arisen.
19) In the instant case since the developer has clutched the jurisdiction of CLB, the question is
whether the provisions of CLB oust the jurisdiction of Consumer Forum. The said question has been
discussed in the above decision as follows:
The next aspect of the matter is whether the provisions of the Companies Act and the RBI Act
impliedly ousts the jurisdiction of the Consumer Forums when the CLB is seized of the matter or
passed an order at the instance of some of the depositors of NBFC. Hence, sub-sees. (4-D) and (5) of
Section 10-E and Section 58-A(9) of the Companies Act and Sections 45-Q and 45-QA of the RBI Act
require to be examined, which are as under:10-E-(4-D) : Every Bench shall be deemed to be a Civil
Court for the purposes of Section 195 and (Chapter XXVI of the Code of Civil Procedure,1973) and
every proceeding before the Bench shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning
of Sections 193 and 228 of the Indian Penal Code and for the purpose of Section 196 of that code.(5)
Without prejudice to the provisions of sub-sections (4-C) and (4-D), the Company Law Board shall
in the exercise of its powers and the discharge of its functions under this Act, or any other law be
guided by the principles of natural justice and shall act in its discretion. 58-A(9): Where a company
has failed to repay any deposit or part thereof in accordance with the terms and conditions of such
deposit, the Company Law Board may, if it is satisfied, either on its own motion or on the
application of the depositor, that it is necessary so to do to safeguard the interests of the company,
the depositors or in the public interest, direct, by order, the company to make repayment of such
deposit or part the order: Provided that the Company Law Board may, before making any order
under this sub-section, give a reasonable opportunity of being heard to the company and the other
persons interested in the matter. Sections 45-Q and 45-QA of the RBI Act are as under: 45-Q:
Chapter III-B to override other Laws: The provisions of this Chapter shall have effect
notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in
force or any instrument having effect by virtue of any such law. 45-QA. Power of Company Law
Board to order repayment of deposit: (1) Every deposit accepted by a non-banking financial
company, unless renewed, shall be repaid in accordance with the terms and conditions of such
deposit. (2) Where a non-banking financial company has failed to repay any deposit or part thereof
in accordance with the terms and conditions of such deposit, the Company Law Board constituted
under Section 10-E of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956) may, if it is satisfied, either on its own
motion or on an application of the depositor, that it is necessary so to do to safeguard the interests
of the company, the depositors or in the public interest, direct, by order, the non-banking financial
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21465778/ 23Srinivas Gunti vs Maytas Hill County Pvt. Ltd. on 27 April, 2012
company to make repayment of such deposit or part thereof forthwith or within such time and
subject to such conditions as may be specified in the order: Provided that the Company Law Board
may, before making any order under this sub-section, give a reasonable opportunity of being heard
to the non-banking financial company and the other persons interested in the matter.
20) The provisions of Reserve Bank of India Act, vis--vis., the CLB also came up for discussion. The
very same logic could as well be applied to the case on hand. In view of the fact that their Lordships
at Para 51 of the above decision opined:
The CLB is constituted by the Central Government and the said Board shall exercise and discourage
powers and functions as may be conferred on it by or under the companies Act or any other law and
shall also exercise and discharge such other powers and functions of the Central Government under
the Companies Act or other law as may be conferred on it by the Central Government.
Notwithstanding subsection (1A) of Section 10-E of the Companies Act, the Civil Courts exercised
jurisdiction under sec.9 of the Code of the Civil Procedure, till sub-section (9) of Section 58-A was
inserted by the Companies (Amendment ) Act, 1977 with effect from 24-12-1977 conferring powers
on the CLB to entertain an application of the depositor for repayment of money. After 1977, till the
enactment of Consumer Act in 1986, both the Civil Courts as well as the CLB entertained
applications from the depositors for refund of deposits. After the Consumer Act, the Forums
established under it started granting redressal to the depositors having regard to the broad
definition service adumbrated in Sec.2(1) (O) of the Consumer Protection Act. Ultimately, to provide
an additional speedy remedy, the Parliament enacted RBI ( Amendment) Act, 1997 inserting
Sec.45-QA giving power to CLB constituted under Sec.10-E of the Companies Act which may, either
on its own motion or on application of the depositors order NBFCs to make repayment of such
deposits. This background should be kept in mind while examining the order of the CLB, Eastern
Region Bench, Calcutta, dated 27-5-1998.
Their lordships also held at para-57 as follows:
Sub-section (5) of Sec.10-E of the Companies Act lays down that the CLB shall in the exercise of its
powers and the discharge of its functions under the Companies Act or any other law be guided by
the principles of natural justice. The proviso to sub-section (9) of Sec.58A categorically lays down
that CLB may, before making any order under sub-sec. (9), give a reasonable opportunity of being
heard to the Company and the other persons interested in the matter. Likewise, the proviso to
sub-section (2) of Sec.45-QA mandates that CLB may, before making any order under sub-section
(2), give an opportunity of being heard to NBFC and the other persons interested in the matter.,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21465778/ 24Srinivas Gunti vs Maytas Hill County Pvt. Ltd. on 27 April, 2012
Elaborate reasoning is not required to infer that the other persons interested in the matter
appearing in the proviso to subsection (9) of Sec.58-A of the Companies Act and the proviso to
sub-section (2) of Sec.45-QA of the RBI Act also include the depositors and other creditors of NBFC.
It also does not require any authority to say that any provision which adumbrates the principles of
natural justice should be interpreted as a mandatory provision. Though the two provisions use the
word may, the same should be interpreted as mandatory.
Obligation is on the part of the CLB to order notices to all the depositors in a matter like this. How a
notice is sent or information is communicated about the cases filed before the CLB under Sec.45-QA
(2) of the RBI Act or Sec.58-A (9) of the Companies Act is altogether different matter.
21) Coming to the present case, the developer did not make any attempt to place the case of the
complainants before the CLB. There is no proof that notices were issued to the complainants while
passing the order. It may be stated herein that all these proceedings have been taken only after the
complainants have clutched the jurisdiction of this Commission. Even assuming that in one or two
cases, the complainants are parties, it makes no difference. Therefore, the learned counsel for the
complainants is justified in contending that in so far as complainants are concerned, the order
passed by CLB is not binding on the proceedings before this Commission.
Their Lordships in the above case at Pare-59 pointed out as follows:
Further, as per the legal position, the proceedings before appropriate Bench of CLB should be
initiated by the aggrieved party at the place of companys registered office. This is cumbersome
procedure. Therefore, all the depositors cannot be expected to appear before the CLB, Calcutta,
especially when there is no notice validly served on all the depositors. The judgments of the
Supreme Court referred to above support the view that when the ordinary remedy provided under
the alternative law is cumbersome, the consumer cannot be deprived of the remedy before the
Consumer Forums.
At para 60, their Lordships asserted as follows:
The summary of the findings under point No.1 for consideration may now be given. (i) A writ of
prohibition cannot be granted unless want of jurisdiction is apparent and if want of jurisdiction is
not apparent, the applicant must wait until the decision making body passes orders and seek a writ
of certiorari. (ii) A writ of prohibition ordinarily cannot be granted to stop execution or
implementation of the decision; (iii) The grant of writ of prohibition is also governed by other
principles which ordinarily govern the grant of extraordinary writs like delay and laches, availability
of alternative remedy etc. (iv) The provisions of Sec.45-Q, 45-QA of the RBI Act and Sec.58-A(9) of
the Companies Act, do not either expressly or impliedly bar the jurisdiction of the forums
constituted under the Consumer Protection Act, from entertaining a consumer dispute case at the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21465778/ 25Srinivas Gunti vs Maytas Hill County Pvt. Ltd. on 27 April, 2012
instance of the depositor claiming repayment of the deposit from a non-banking finance company.
In view of Sec.3 of the Consumer Protection Act, remedy under the said Act is an additional remedy
and the same cannot be taken away either by the RBI Act or by the Companies Act. (v) The order of
the Company Law Board, Eastern Region Bench, Calcutta dated 27-5-1998 cannot be construed as
either taking away the right of the depositors in these cases to approach the consumer forum or
nullifying the orders passed by the District Forum/State Commission.
22) Equally the National Commission in Lloyds Finance Ltd. Vs. Ms. Napeena Singh reported in I
(2006) CPJ 163 NC considering this aspect of the matter held:
It is the case of the complainants before us that they did not apply to the Company Law Board under
Section 45QA. They were not served with any notice of any proceedings before the Company Law
Board and they were not aware of any notice being published in any newspaper to which they
subscribe to or is otherwise in circulation in the locality in which they reside. They say it is
perversity of justice that Company Law Board situated in Mumbai could be approached by small
depositors in the far flung corner of the country. The whole scheme as framed is floated and tilted in
favour of NBFC. That is, however, not for us to consider. What the requirement of law is that a
depositor may either approach the Company Law Board under Section 45QA or file a complaint
under the Consumer Protection Act before the appropriate forum. A depositor cannot certainly
choose both the remedies simultaneously and once he files an application under Section 45QA of the
RBI Act before the Company Law Board, he cannot file a complaint in a Consumer Forum under the
Consumer Protection Act.
It is not the case of the developer that complainants have invoked the jurisdiction of CLB. Therefore
this Commission has jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter.
23) The learned advocate for developer contended that in the order dt. 13.1.2011 of CLB it has
considered the interests of investors, banks stakeholders, and the allottees. It held:
Having perused CA 24/2011 and the above mentioned documents and the fact that the petitioner,
the existing directors of MPL, shareholders and the Hill County Owners association are supporting
the application, and the prayer made in the application deserves to be granted since it is in the best
interests of the company as also of all the stakeholders including banks, employees, investors and
the aloottees in the Maytas Hill County Residential Project, and would serve the public interest, the
following order is passed in supersession of the earlier order dt. 5.3.2009.
I permit the induction of IL&FAS (consisting of Infrastructure, Leasing & Financial Services Ltd.
(IL&FS). IL&FS Financial Services Ltd. (IFIN) and IL&FS Engineering & Construction Company
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21465778/ 26Srinivas Gunti vs Maytas Hill County Pvt. Ltd. on 27 April, 2012
Ltd. (IECL) as the now promoter of MPL and permit reconstitution of the board of MPL as provided
hereunder :
The IL&FS group shall invest Rs. 20 lakhs in equity share capital of the MPL whereupon its
shareholding in MPL would become 80% The IL&FS group on induction as the strategic investor
shall take over the management control of the MPL and reconstitute the board of directors of MPL
as under :
There shall be four nominees of the IL&FS group as directors on the board of MPL including the
Chairman The existing directors of MPL Mr. Rama Raju, Mr. D. Gopala Krishnam Raju and D.
Venkata Satya Subba Raju shall resign as directors of MPL immediately on induction of IL&FS
group as strategic investor in MPL.
Mr. Ved Jain, the nominee director appointed by the Union of India pursuant to the directions
contained in the order dt. 5.4.2009 shall continue as director in MPL for a further period of 3 years.
The IL&FS group shall mobilize funds of 150 crores in MPL within a period of three months from
today.
The IL&FS group shall complete the Maytas Hill County Residential Project phase-I within 18
months of its induction as promoter in MPL, and shall arrange the requires finances to complete the
project.
It is not known whether the said order has been complied viz., raising of Rs. 150 crores etc. The
opposite parties could not confirm the order was implemented. Though he contended that various
steps were taken to complete the project on time, no evidence is placed to show the exact stage of the
project. Affidavit of none of the directors of the company was filed to show the stage of construction,
nor the fact that any of the projects were completed.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21465778/ 27Srinivas Gunti vs Maytas Hill County Pvt. Ltd. on 27 April, 2012
24) The contention of the developer is that the complainants are stakeholders. Simply by using such
term, the complainants cannot be taken into its fold in order to bind the orders of CLB. At the cost of
repetition, we may state that it is not known why the opposite parties did not try to implead these
parties to the application filed before the CLB so that they could agitate their grievances including
the recovery of amount. Equally so with the bank.
25) A reading of the order passed by CLB shows that it was not aware of the cases pending before
the Consumer Commission in Andhra Pradesh. Undoubtedly, the developer has with-held the
information pertaining to these cases before the CLB. In the light of the above said decision, we are
of the opinion that this Commission has jurisdiction. The orders passed by CLB have nothing to do
with the cases on hand. The CLB was not appraised about the cases that were filed before this
Commission. In view of the above decision, we are of the opinion that the orders of CLB would in no
way prevent or prohibit us from passing appropriate orders as the case may be.
26) The learned counsel for the developer contended that any order directing cancellation of
allotment or refund of amount would result in disbursement of the amount of the company, and
therefore the complainants cannot seek refund of the amount paid by them. It is not known as to the
exact amount that the developer had availed as finance from banks and other financial institutions.
The developer except contending that the construction has been taken up and is in progress could
not deny the statement of the complainants when they contended that no work was taken up. It
could have sought for appointment of Commissioner or filed documents evidencing the construction
activity.
27) Since the developer could not prove the stages of construction or that it would hand over
possession within a reasonable period, and the period that was originally stipulated was already
expired, and all through the complainants have been paying EMIs to the bank, we are of the opinion
that it would be unjust that the complainants be directed to go on paying the amounts to the banks
without there being any hope of getting the project completed.
28) The complainants by issuing notice to the developer cancelled the agreements invoking clause-9
of the said agreement, and directed the developer to pay the consideration received so far, as no
construction was taken up nor completed, and sought for refund of the amount paid by the bank to
it with penalty @ Rs. 5/- per sft as per clause 7 (a to d) of the agreement. However, we do not see
any justification in impleading the original owners of property, who have no subsisting interest in
the property. They have parted their title in favour of developer. Therefore the claims against them
do not sustain. The complaints are liable to be dismissed against them. Equally the complainant had
issued notice to the bank alleging that the entire loan amount was released contrary to the tripartite
agreement; wherein it had agreed to disburse stage wise. It was contrary to the agreement besides
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21465778/ 28Srinivas Gunti vs Maytas Hill County Pvt. Ltd. on 27 April, 2012
the guidelines under home loans scheme. It was also mentioned that since the developer had failed
to complete the construction as per the terms of agreement of sale as well as tripartite agreement,
the bank has to initiate the proceedings and recover the amount and return the loan amount
recovered from them with no due certificate. They have enclosed the termination notice issued to
the developer while sending notice to the bank. Neither of them had given any reply.
29) We may also state that recovery of money had of the complainant by the developer depends on
the principle of unjust enrichment. This principle requires first that the developer has been enriched
by receipt of a benefit, secondly, that this enrichment is at the expense of the complainant, and
thirdly, that the retention of the enrichment be unjust. This justifies restitution.
We may also quote herein the words of Lord Mansfiled C.J.
This kind of equitable action to recover back money which ought not in justice to be kept.. lies only
for money which ex acquo et bono the defendant ought to refund .. It lies for money paid by mistake,
or upon a consideration which happens to fail, or for money got through imposition (express or
implied) or extortion, or oppression, or undue advantage taken of the plaintiffs situation, contrary to
laws made for the protection of persons under those circumstances. In one word, the gist of this
kind of action is, that the defendant, upon the circumstances of the case, is obliged by the ties of
natural justice and equity to refund the money.
(emphasis supplied) Section 72 of the Indian Contract Act runs as follows :
A person to whom money has been paid, or anything delivered, by mistake or under coercion, must
repay or return it. There must be some undue pecuniary inequality existing in the one party relative
to the other which the law recognizes as requiring compensation upon equitable principles.
30) In some of the cases, sale deeds were executed in favour of the complainants by the developer
conveying the title. Obviously, the complainants cannot have title as well as refund of the amount,
since the very sale has been frustrated, in such a case, when the developer has executed the sale deed
and there is no prospect of either constructing flats or delivering the property to the complainants,
the Honble Supreme Court in somewhat similar case Vinod Kumar Thareja Vs. M/s. Alpha
Construction reported in CPJ II (2011) CPJ -3 SC while giving directions to refund the amount also
directed to re-convey the property to the builder. Therefore, we direct the complainants to execute
re-conveyance deed on receipt of amount payable by the developer and the bank. The registration
charges shall be borne by the developer. This is in conformity with the above said decision of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21465778/ 29Srinivas Gunti vs Maytas Hill County Pvt. Ltd. on 27 April, 2012
Honble Supreme Court.
31) We may also state herein that the orders of this Commission against the very same developer
(vide C.C. 30/2009) directing to refund the amount with interest @ 12% p.a., has been upheld by the
National Commission in F.A. No. 189/2010 while reducing the compensation from Rs. 5 lakhs to Rs.
1 lakh. The SLP moved by the developer before the Honble Supreme Court in Appeal (Civil) No.
26256/2010 was dismissed on 27.09.2010. Therefore these matters are covered by the above
decisions and there is no need for any distinction to be made between these cases. These contentions
do not sustain.
32) It is an undisputed fact that agreement for purchase of apartment is between the complainant
and the developer. It is also not in dispute as per the above said agreement the amount is to be paid
as per the schedule which we have adverted at para-3 of this order. Recoursing the above agreement,
a tripartite agreement was executed in between the complainant, developer and the bank except in
C.C. 12/2010 and C.C. 40/2011 where facility agreements were executed. The complainants allege
that contrary to the terms of the above said agreement the amount was disbursed. In fact it was duty
bound to review the progress of construction before disbursing the amount as mentioned in the
tripartite agreement. The bank cannot resile from the tripartite agreement and terms of the
agreement by alleging that they (complainants) have consented to release the amount to the
developer in one go. No security was taken from the builder before release.
33) We may refer herein some of the important terms of the tripartite agreement:
2) UTI bank shall make disbursement of the sanctioned loan by making payment to the developer
directly on behalf of the borrower and payments made to the developer shall be deemed to be
payments made to the borrower and borrower shall in each case be liable for the amount of the loan
disbursed or his/her behalf to the developer, as though the same had been disbursed directly to
him/her. It is further agreed by the borrower that UTI bank shall not be responsible or liable to
ensure or ascertain the progress of the construction and mere demands by the borrower for
disbursement would be sufficient for UTI bank to effect disbursement as aforesaid provided that all
other sanction stipulations are complied by the borrower.
However, UTI Bank as its sole discretion, shall disburse the loan in suitable instalments, at the
request of borrower, or in suitable instalments to be decided by UTI bank, with reference to need or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21465778/ 30Srinivas Gunti vs Maytas Hill County Pvt. Ltd. on 27 April, 2012
progress of construction, which decision shall be final and binding on the borrower/developer. The
borrower shall be responsible for follow with the UTI bank to make disbursement on his/her behalf
as per any agreement, payment schedule he/she may have with the developer. Not withstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, UTI bank may in its sole discretion refused to disburse
the loan until:
(a) Borrowers has paid his/her own contribution in full to the developer (the cost of the dwelling
unit less the loan) and the progress and need of the construction justifies the disbursement
requested.
3) The developer further agrees to total subrogation of borrowers right to receive refund of all the
monies, received by the developer from UTI bank on behalf of the borrower in favour UTI Bank. In
any event in which such refund becomes due and payable to the borrower under any
agreement/arrangement executed/made between the developer and the borrower, the developer in
particular agrees and undertakes not to pay any amount on any account or under any circumstances
to the borrower by way of refund or otherwise without first receiving a written consent of UTI bank.
The borrower and the developer also agrees that as soon as the first disbursement is made by UTI
bank, the mortgage/charge in favour of UTI bank shall, without the necessity of any deed, document
or writing, fasten on the said dwelling unit and the same shall continue (notwithstanding its
allotment, completion and occupation) until the loan of UTI bank is fully repaid with interest and all
other dues.
(5) If for any reason there is an increase in the cost of the dwelling unit such increase in the cost of
the dwelling unit shall be paid/borne by the borrower without any reference to UTI bank and until
such payment is made UTI bank shall have the right to suspend further disbursement of the
sanctioned loan 7(a) Upon cancellation of the allotment of schedule property, made to the
borrower for any reason, the developer shall immediately intimate about the same in writing to UTI
Bank. Upon receipt of such intimation, UTI Bank shall notify the developer all amounts due to it
from the borrower. In such an event, the developer shall forthwith pay UTI Bank all amounts
received by it from UTI Bank on behalf of the borrower within 60 days of receipt of such statement
during which period, the developer shall pay interest to UTI Bank, at the rate of interest on such
amount shall be the same as agreed between the UTI Bank and borrower in the loan agreement.
(b) Further the developer hereby agrees that it shall also pay all the remaining amounts due and
payable to UTI Bank from the borrower such as defaulted payments, additional interest, etc. after
deducting reasonable expenses (as agreed by the developer, and UTI Bank) incurred by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21465778/ 31Srinivas Gunti vs Maytas Hill County Pvt. Ltd. on 27 April, 2012
developer from the sale proceeds of the property. Further any such sale by the developer can be
effected only after obtaining a consent from UTI Bank.
9) That in the event of default in payment of any dues to UTI bank by the borrower UTI Bank may at
its sole discretion enforce the security by sale of the land and dwelling unit for which the loan has
been availed by the borrower and the developer shall not raise any objection/obstruction for the
same and shall accept another purchaser for the house or flat in place of the borrower, however
subject to the substitute purchaser complying with the necessary requirements of the developer in
this respect. If there are any dues/ outstandings payable by the borrower to the developer the same
shall be subordinate/secondary to that of the liability of the borrower to UTI Bank.
CC 12 of 2010 CC 40 of 2011
34) We may also mention herein that the very same terms were mentioned however couched as
facility agreement. In fact in those cases the signatures of the complainants were taken mostly on
blank formats without filling up various clauses. The fact remains that these agreements being taken
more or less on the very same day they have to be read holistically to appreciate the cases.
35) The complainant contends that contrary to the terms of agreement and also various guide lines
for releasing loan amounts, the bank has released the entire amount in one go without considering
the stages of construction to the detriments of their interests. The bank can directly pay the amount
to the developer as agreed upon but not whole of the amount without even verifying the stages of
construction and existence of property. It could not have released the amount without verifying the
progress of construction jeopardising their claims. By referring to project programme guide lines
where there was specific reference that the developer should be in business for not less than 5 years
and the builder/developer has history of due completion of 3 projects and it should have completed
at least 1,00,000 sft. of built up area, and that without satisfying the eligibility criterion the bank
could not have sanctioned Advance Disbursement Facility (ADF for short). They contend that the
developer was incorporated on 20-1-2005 and the amount was released without completion of 5
years to avail ADF contrary to stipulations.
36) The bank contends that by virtue of tripartite agreement the developer has to indemnity the
bank in cases of this nature where under it was specifically mentioned that :
7(a) Upon cancellation of the allotment of schedule property, made to the borrower for any reason,
the developer shall immediately intimate about the same in writing to UTI Bank. Upon receipt of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21465778/ 32Srinivas Gunti vs Maytas Hill County Pvt. Ltd. on 27 April, 2012
such intimation, UTI Bank shall notify the developer all amounts due to it from the borrower. In
such an event, the developer shall forthwith pay UTI Bank all amounts received by it from UTI Bank
on behalf of the borrower within 60 days of receipt of such statement during which period, the
developer shall pay interest to UTI Bank, at the rate of interest on such amount shall be the same as
agreed between the UTI Bank and borrower in the loan agreement.
The developer and complainant are jointly liable for any of the claim for the loan amount disbursed.
In the light of above clause they are estopped from making any claim. In order to get over the
payment of the amount towards EMI they were impleaded as parties. It is only a financial institution
facilitating funding of the project and purchase thereof. It has nothing to do with the completion of
construction.
37) Curiously the bank despite the notices of cancellation of agreements etc. and even filing
complaints before this Commission and proceedings before the CLB, did not try to recover the
amount paid by it to the developer invoking the above clauses. The banker knew full well the
amounts were diverted for some other purpose. It did not take steps to recover from the developer,
obviously, it knew it would land up in litigation, where it may not be sure for recovery of the
amount. It knew full well the complainants being salaried persons it was easy for them to recover.
38) Evidently the bank did not take any steps to recover the amount, only in the event of bank
sustaining loss, this indemnity clause comes into play. The bank had taken a letter from the
complainants wherein they had agreed to release the amount without waiting for construction to be
made. This is contrary to the guidelines and tripartite agreement. It is not known why the bank had
taken such a stance when the guidelines as well as their own agreements stipulate to release the
amount stage wise. The fact remains that the bank released the amounts to the developer contrary to
guidelines as well as tripartite agreement to non-existent apartments.
39) The bank having been a party to the tripartite agreement cannot direct the complainants to
execute such a letter without the consent of the developer in this regard. This is contrary to the
terms of the tripartite agreement . By taking so called consent from the complainants to release the
entire amount, the bank is offending the terms of agreement. There cannot be any objection for the
developer to take it. After all it will have the entire amount without corresponding burden to fulfil. It
need not construct. Had developer been joined, the complainants could have insisted the developer
to construct the property and only after satisfying itself as to the phases of construction, they would
have asked the banker to release the amount accordingly. There would be no meaning in releasing
the entire amount in one go, the bank having agreed to release the amount in a phased manner.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21465778/ 33Srinivas Gunti vs Maytas Hill County Pvt. Ltd. on 27 April, 2012
Solely basing on the letter taken from the complainants, the bank cannot give a go bye to tripartite
agreement and release the entire amount. This would cause unjust enrichment to the developer, and
loss to the complainants. The terms of the agreement in between three parties were made in order to
see that no party suffers from non-implementation of terms of the agreement. The bank cannot act
at its own whims and fancies, and release the amount. It cannot defend that by virtue of letters of
the complainants, it was entitled to release the amount in its entirety.
40) If the bank acts contrary to the agreement and guidelines the complainants are not liable to
refund the amount paid to the developer. The bank can as well recover from the developer by
recoursing the above clauses. The courts will not come to the rescue of the party which violates the
terms and convey benefits to one party in preference to another. It intends to cause loss to a genuine
borrower by unduly favouring a defaulting and unfair customer. All this amounts to unfair trade
practice.
41) It is not as though the bank did not know that the developer has clutched the jurisdiction of the
CLB. When the matter is pending with CLB, if really it intends to protect its own interest besides
that of the complainants, in the light of dispute, it ought to have approached the CLB for recovery of
the amounts. It did not even file the proceedings before the appropriate authority for recovery of the
amount. Evidently the bank knew full well that it could recover the amount from the complainants.
42) The banks and financial institutions promising to lend moneys or sanctioning loans and the
borrower investing in the project thereon will be clothed by the principles of Promisorry Estoppel.
The doctrine of promissory estoppel is an evolving doctrine, contours of which are not yet fully and
finally demarcated. Being an equitable doctrine it should be kept elastic enough in the hands of the
court to do complete justice between the parties. If the equity demands that the promissor is allowed
to resile and the promisee is compensated appropriately that ought to be done. If, however, equity
demands that the promissor should be precluded in the light of things done by the promise on the
faith of representation from resiling and that he should be held fast to his representation that should
be done. It is a matter holding scales even between the parties to do justice between them. This is
the equity implicit in the doctrine vide State of H.P. Vs. Ganesh Wood Products reported in 1995 (6)
SCC 363.
43) It is legally open to the bank to take a decision in good faith in the exercise of its bonafide
discretion as to whether it was safe to make advances of public funds to any particular party and
arrive at a decision after examining the relevant facts and circumstances.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21465778/ 34Srinivas Gunti vs Maytas Hill County Pvt. Ltd. on 27 April, 2012
44) However, in the present case the complainants by issuing notice put an end to the contract as
the developer disabled itself from performing its obligations. The bank did not act in good faith nor
it had exercised bonafide discretion while releasing the funds.
Recourse can be had to a decision in Nannapaneni Venkata Rao Co-operative Sugars Ltd. Vs. State
Bank of India reported in AIR 2003 AP 515 (DB) it was held :
Refusal on the part of the respondent bank to pay interest on the ground that opening of such
account and crediting of the interest is not in accordance with the guidelines of RBI is not tenable as
the respondent is solely responsible for suppressing the fact while entering into the contract.
45) This Commission can take judicial cognizance of the fact that various banks have financed the
builder obviously in view of reputation the developer was having by then, and the bank contrary to
the terms of the agreement as well as guidelines disbursed the amounts keeping the interests of the
complainants in jeopardy. The banks are picking and choosing certain clauses and contending that
the very complainants have given authorization to them to release the amount and therefore they
have released, forgetting the fact that the very financing of the project was contrary to the scheme
issued in this regard. Evidently, the bank as well as the developer benefitted from these transactions.
The developer has taken the amount without constructing any of the flats, and equally the bank has
been collecting the amounts from the complainants towards EMI. It is a case of double jeopardy.
Necessarily all this amounts to unfair trade practise as well as deficiency in service on the part of
developer as well as the bank. Necessarily the complainants have to be compensated. Since terms of
the agreement enable the bank to collect from the developer it can as well recover the same. The
bank by violating its own rules cannot take advantage and recover the same from the complainants.
This suppression of rules at the time when so called authorization taken from the complainants
amounts to unfair trade practise. This cannot be allowed to happen.
46) The bank has undoubtedly violated the terms of the tripartite agreement, and released the
amount even without bothering to verify as to the stage and nature of construction. In other words,
the bank financed to a non-existent project or incomplete project, duping its own customers. Now
the complainants would be un-necessarily hard pressed, to pay the amounts towards EMI without
there being any hope of getting the apartments as the developer is under winding up proceedings.
The bank cannot take advantage of its own indiscretion. This is unjust and unethical. If the bank
releases the amounts contrary to tripartite agreement it has to suffer for the consequential losses.
Whatever loss caused thereby it could as well approach appropriate forum for recovery of the
amount from the developer, to which it has released the amount in one go. The bank under the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/21465778/ 35Srinivas Gunti vs Maytas Hill County Pvt. Ltd. on 27 April, 2012
terms entitled to recover from the developer to which it had paid the amounts. It cannot turn round
and claim against the complainants. It is not under original stipulation that the bank had to pay the
entire amount to the developer. The developer also agreed to refund the amount if there are
cancellations of the agreements or failure to fulfil its commitments. The agreement that was arrived
at earlier was fair and no party would benefit from the lapses or mistakes of the other. Therefore, the
complainant are not liable to pay the EMIs.
47) The bank has to collect the loan amount plus whatever interest and other legally permissible
charges from the developer and credit it to the complainants loan account. It shall not collect further
EMIs nor entitled to any more amount except the amount, if any, remained unpaid by the
complainant towards loan granted to him. The bank has no authority to complain to CIBIL. In fact if
there is a provision, the CIBIL has to enter the name of the bank, as one of the violators of guidelines
of the banks.
In the result the complaints are allowed in part in following terms:
CC 46 of 2010 CC 12 of 2010 The developer Op1 and Op15 are directed to refund the amounts paid
by the complainants with interest @ 12% p.a., from respective dates till the date of payment together
with compensation of Rs. 1 lakh, and costs of Rs. 10,000/- in each of the complaint.
Further the developer Op1 and Op15 are directed to refund the amount disbursed by the bank to it
along with penal charges etc. levied by the bank if any, failing which the bank is liable to collect, and
credit the same to the loan account of the complainants.
In case sale deed was executed the complainants shall re-convey the same to the developer on
compliance of above directions. The registration charges and stamp duty etc. shall be borne by the
developer Op1 and Op15.
The complaints against Ops 2 to 14 are dismissed without costs.
