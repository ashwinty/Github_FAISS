CORAM :- S. C. DHARMADHIKARI &
B. P. COLABAWALLA, JJ.
Reserved on :- 6 th October, 2015
Pronounced on:- 22 nd December, 2015
JUDGMENT :
- (Per S. C. Dharmadhikari, J.) In all these Petitions, the Petitioners have challenged the
constitutional validity of some of the provisions of the Maharashtra Purchase Tax on Sugarcane Act,
1962 (for short "the Act of 1962"). Since common questions of fact and law are involved, all these
Petitions are disposed of by this common judgment.
2) We grant Rule in some of the Petitions which have been listed for admission and along with
others which are ready for hearing. Even these Petitions would be disposed of finally by
J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc this judgment. In other words, since all parties
agreed and are present before the Court, with their consent, the Petitions are disposed of finally by
this judgment.
3) The leading argument canvassed is in Writ Petition No. 2060 of 1997. We would refer to the facts
in this Writ Petition.
4) The Petitioner is a Co-operative Society registered under the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies
Act, 1960. It is a Co-operative Sugar Factory situate at Nashik District of Maharashtra. The
Respondents to the Petition are the State, Commissioner of Purchase Tax (Sugarcane), Purchase Tax
Officer (Sugarcane). The Petitioner also holds licence under the Act of 1962. It is stated that the
Petitioner, at its factory, manufactures sugar and allied products out of sugarcane received from
respective members, majority of whom are cultivators of sugarcane having their own land under
cultivation. Apart from challenging the constitutional validity of sections 2, 3 and 6 of the Act of
1962 as amended from 1st October, 1995, the Petitioner also challenges the legality and validity of
the letters dated 19 th October, 1996, 20th November, 1996 and 6th January, 1997, issued to the
Petitioner by Respondent No. 3. The Maharashtra Act IX of 1962 was enacted on 18 th April, 1962. It
is an Act to J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc provide for levy and collection of a tax
on the purchase of sugarcane for use in manufacture or production of sugar including Khandsari
Sugar. The words commencing from "the manufacture or production of sugar including Khandsari
Sugar"
were substituted for the words "the manufacture of sugar" by Maharashtra Act 60 of
1974. Section 1 provides that this Act will extend to the whole Maharashtra. Section 2
contains definitions and we are concerned with the definition of the terms "factory",
"licence", "occupier", "prescribed" and "unit". These definitions read as under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 28The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
"2(b) "Factory" means any premises (including the precincts thereof), wherein twenty
or more workers are working and in which, or in any part of which any
manufacturing process connected with the production of sugar by means of vacuum
pans is being carried on, or ordinarily carried on, with the aid of power.
2(c) "licence" means a licence granted or renewed under this Act.
2(d) "occupier" of a factory or of a unit means the person who has ultimate control
over the affairs of the factory or the unit and where the said affairs are entrusted to a
managing agent, such agent shall be deemed to be the occupier of the factory or of the
unit, as the case may be; and the term includes also any person appointed by the
occupier to act as a purchasing agent.
2(f) "prescribed" means prescribed by rules made under this Act.
2(h) "unit" means a unit engaged or ordinarily engaged in the manufacture or
production of Khandsari sugar and which is capable of handling or processing
sugarcane juice produced with the aid of a crusher driven by power."
J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc
5) Therefore, unless the context otherwise requires, the definitions will have to be read and
understood as enacted above.
By section 3, it is stated that there shall be levied and collected a tax on the purchase of sugarcane
being purchased for use in the manufacture or production of sugar in a factory or a unit. By section
3A, which was inserted by Maharashtra Act 15 of 2011, certain provisions of the Maharashtra Value
Added Tax Act, 2002 and Rules made thereunder are made applicable so far as they relate to the
electronic filing of returns and electronic payment of tax, or any amount payable under this Act of
1962.
6) The Act of 1962 has been amended on several occasions. By section 4, taxing and licensing
authorities are set out and that is how the State Government can appoint an officer to be called the
Commissioner of Purchase Tax (Sugarcane) and may appoint one or more officers to assist such
Commissioner for the purpose of functions under this Act and give them such designations as may
be prescribed. By section 5, there is a provision made for issuance of a licence for purchasing
sugarcane for use in the manufacture or production of sugar. By section 6, every occupier liable to
pay tax under the Act of 1962 shall, within thirty days after the end of every month to which the
return relates, submit a monthly return in the prescribed form to J.V.Salunke,PA
WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc the Commissioner. By section 6A, special provisions for transitional
accounting year have been made. By section 7, provisions are made for assessment and collection of
tax. By section 7A, penalty is imposed for failure to submit the return.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 29The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
By section 7B, there is a liability to pay interest if the occupier fails to submit the return. By section
7C, interest on amount of refund is provided for, whereas, by section 7D, interest on delayed refund
is dealt with. By section 7E, refund of excess payment of tax is contemplated, whereas, by sections 8
and 9, there is a provision for Appeal and Revision to a person aggrieved. By section 10, Court fees
on appeal and applications are provided for and by section 11, it is clarified that in computing the
period laid down in sections 8 and 9, provisions of section 4 and 12 of the Indian Limitation Act,
1963 shall, so far as may be, apply. By section 12, finality is given to an assessment, imposition of
penalty or interest or charging of interest and by section 12A, special mode of recovery is set out. By
section 12B, there is a power of remission and exemption and by sections 13, 14, 15 and 15A, service
of notice, power to inspect and take copies of records and documents, information acquired to be
treated as confidential, publication and disclosure of information respecting occupiers of factories
and units and other persons of public interest are the matters dealt with. By section 16, the
J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc offences and penalties are set out. By section 17, the
compounding of offence is permitted. By section 18, there is a power conferred in the State
Government to make Rules and generally to carry out the purpose of the Act and such Rules made
includes Rules for levy of fees for any of the purposes of the Act.
Certain purchases are not liable to tax and which are falling within section 19 of the Act and by
section 20, the Maharashtra Purchase Tax on Sugarcane Ordinance, 1961 is repealed.
7) This sums up the provisions of the Act, but the individual section, the changes and amendments
thereto and the impact of the same would be considered while dealing with the rival contentions.
8) The Petitioners state that they have submitted their periodical returns and paid the tax under the
Act. However, the State, by enacting the Maharashtra Tax Laws (Levy and Amendment) Act, 1995,
amended several enactments and which included the provisions of the Act of 1962. It is the case of
the Petitioners that by the amending Act XVI of 1995, the Act of 1962 was radically changed so as to
provide for levy of tax on the purchases of sugarcane based on the purchase price instead of the
quantity purchased. The Petitioners therefore challenge the validity of the said amendments carried
out by this Amendment J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc Act. It is the case of the
Petitioners that by the amendments, the definitions of "purchase price, "turnover purchases", which
were not in the original Act, were introduced for the first time. The definition of the term "purchase"
was also inserted for the first time to mean purchase of sugarcane made within the State of
Maharashtra for a valuable consideration and includes the supply by a shareholder to a Co-operative
society for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration. The Petitioners, therefore,
submit that these sweeping changes in the Act of 1962 adversely affected the sugar units like the
Petitioners. The earlier system was to allow the units to make payments of purchase tax by two
installments, 50% payable during the season while the balance 50% was allowed to be paid in five
equal installments during off season. The amended position in law, in nutshell, made departure
from earlier system of levying tax on quantity basis coupled with the deductions that were provided
under the unamended section 3(3). After the amendment, the tax is provided to be levied not only
on the consideration that a buyer would pay to the seller, but two more additions were required to
be made to the said consideration before arriving at the purchase price for the purpose of the Act, on
which tax is sought to be levied. The direct result of such amendment is that the amounts which may
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 30The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
have been charged by the cultivator for J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc transporting
the sugarcane to the factory gate or the expenses incurred for harvesting the sugarcane in the farm,
would also be added to the consideration as forming part of the purchase price.
The Petitioner is a member of the Federation, namely, Maharashtra State Co-operative Sakhar
Karkhana Sangh Limited. Through that Federation, representations were made to the State
Government requesting to clarify the impact of the amendment carried out to the Act. Accordingly,
the Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax (Headquarters), by his letter dated 5 th September, 1996,
clarified that it was necessary to include the expenses incurred for sugarcane transport in the
purchase price before paying tax. Similarly, it was clarified that the expenses incurred by the
cultivator for cutting the sugarcane being incidental expenses would also be covered under the
definition of the term 'purchase price' as amended. According to the said clarification, the purchase
tax was payable on the consideration as also on the expenses incurred for transporting the
sugarcane to the factory gate and cutting charges. The above referred facility of making payment of
tax in two installments was also withdrawn. Annexure 'A' is copy of this letter. This clarification was
in addition to the earlier clarification by the Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax (Headquarters)
dated 27 th June, 1996 Annexure 'B'. Since the interpretation placed by Respondent J.V.Salunke,PA
WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc No.2 through its subordinate was erroneous and arbitrary, the
Petitioners sought legal advice and they were informed that the Respondents were not justified in
holding that the expenditure incurred for transportation of sugarcane, even though paid to some
third party, amounted to the sum charged by the cultivator.
This, according to the Petitioner, tantamounts to ignoring the meaning of the phrase "the amount
charged". The Petitioners complain that if provisions are read in the context in which they appear, it
is apparent that wherever the cultivator charges separately to the occupier the amount for
transporting the sugarcane severed from the farm to the factory gate, such amount would form part
of purchase price. There can be no dispute about such an addition, but according to the
interpretation placed by the Respondents, any expenditure incurred by the factory or the
Petitioners, distinct separate and independent of the purchase of sugarcane in question, would also
have to be included or added to the consideration paid to the cultivator. This interpretation,
according to the Petitioners, runs counter to the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 as also the
principles which determine the transfer of title to the goods from the buyer to the seller.
J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc
9) The Petitioner then refers to several other Acts enacted by the Parliament and particularly the
Essential Commodities Act, 1955, the control orders pertaining to sugarcane thereunder. They also
refer to the provisions of Sale of Goods Act and all this is referred and relied upon to explain the
procedure followed by the Petitioners throughout the year. The procedure commences from
supplying the seeds to the cultivator to the point when the sugarcane so grown and severed from the
land as per the programme formulated much in advance is explained. The emphasis is that sugar
industry is a seasonal industry. The sugar season normally commences from October-
November and culminates by April-May of the following year.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 31The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
However, the exact duration of the season entirely depends on the growth of sugarcane, which in
turn entirely depends on the rainfall during rainy season. Sugarcane is the main raw material for the
sugar industry and therefore, each sugar manufacturer would ensure adequate supply of raw
materials. With that view in end, the Petitioner Societies have established a separate Cane
Development Department. In paras 30, 31, 32 and 33, this is what is urged by the Petitioners:-
"30. Whenever a particular cultivator desires or plans to have the crop planning, the
cultivator concerned would first approach the sugar factory in his area for procuring
sugarcane seeds. The crop planning would be finalized after considering the
availability of water in the area concerned.
J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc The Petitioner in question would
thereafter supply the sugarcane seed to the cultivator from its own nursery and in
case the required seeds are not available in the nursery, the cultivator in question
would be permitted to procure the sugarcane seed from the market and its cost would
be reimbursed by the Petitioner in question. The cost of seed supply at this initial
stage is treated as interest-free loan by the sugar factories to the cultivator which is to
be adjusted against the purchase price, i.e., the consideration to be paid to the
cultivator for supply of sugarcane which he would be cultivating in his farm. Thus,
right from the moment of sowing the seed for sugarcane, there is an agreement
between the cultivator concerned and the factory in question that the entire crop that
may be grown in his land out of the seeds so supplied, would be sold by the cultivator
to the sugar factory in question.
31. In order to ensure the execution of proper planning of sugar crushing, the
cultivator concerned is required to submit the information of sugarcane plantation in
a prescribed form to the Agricultural Department of the factory in question. After
receiving the information about sugarcane plantation, the same is counter-checked
by the staff employed by the factory owner as the field Mukadam, who would verify
the area of plantation, the quality of the sugarcane in question, the date of plantation
etc. After receiving such a scrutiny report from the field Mukadam, the Agricultural
Department records the finding in a separate register mentioning therein the name of
the cultivator, the date of plantation etc. After the cultivator satisfies the correctness
of the information as confirmed by the report of the field Mukadam, the factory in
question would issue a certificate on the basis of which the cultivator, if he so desires,
can obtain the finance from the bank which is known as crop loan so that he can meet
the expenses of cultivation including the cost of fertilizers, pesticides, wages to
workers etc. As per the system and the procedure adopted in the State of
Maharashtra, the crop loan so granted to the individual cultivator, may be by a bank
or the co-operative credit society, is again required to be adjusted against the sale
proceeds of the sugarcane purchased from the cultivator in question.
32. Each factory would prepare its own harvesting programme on the basis of the
entries in their register referred to hereinabove. In the interim period, the sugar
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 32The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
factory would depute one of its officers known as Cultivator Officer or Cane
Development Officer to the farm so as to ensure the proper growth of sugarcane
planted by J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc sugarcane grower. He
would also guide the farmer about the proper quantity of fertilizers to be utilized
depending on the analysis he may obtain of the contents of the soil in question.
33. Before the sugarcane is severed, or before the commencement of the crushing
season as is generally known, the sugar factory in question would arrange to test the
maturity of the cane by selecting at random the samples of sugarcane grown in the
field. After successful testing is done at the laboratory, and if found fit, the sugar
factory would give a notice to the cultivator concerned to stop watering the cane for a
period of 15 days so that proper harvesting of the cane could be done. Accordingly, a
timetable is prepared as to which field is to be visited for the purpose of harvesting
the sugarcane from a particular period. With the help of the workers employed by the
sugar factory, the sugarcane grown in a particular field is severed and stacked on the
border of the farm in question. The Petitioner herein has maintained Crop Collecting
Centres in all remote places. As and when the crops are brought to the Collecting
Centre, the representative of the sugar factory would accept the delivery of the
sugarcane and issue a receipt on behalf of the sugar factory concerned. The sugar
factory, thereafter, i.e., after the completion of the event of its purchase from the
cultivator, arrange for the transportation of the sugarcane through its own agency by
its own truck or by the trucks arranged for the purpose from outside agencies.
However, in all such cases, three copies of the receipt issued by the representative of
the sugar factory at the Collecting Centre accompany the truck driver to the factory
where the sugarcane so brought are weighed at the weigh bridge. The weighment is
recorded on all the three copies of the receipts, one such receipt is returned to the
truck driver while another copy is delivered to the cultivator for his information, and
the third copy is transmitted to the Accounts Department for payment process. In
nutshell, the ownership of the sugarcane always vests with the sugar factory in
question, though in the eyes of law, the sugarcane can be said to have been purchased
only when the sugarcane is severed from the firm in question. After its severance, the
cultivator transfers the physical property or the title to the goods by delivering the
severed sugarcane to the agent of the buyer-sugar factory. Therefore, the point of
time when the transaction of sale by the cultivator and the purchase by the sugar
factory, can be said to have been fructified, is the time when the delivery of the
sugarcane is given by the cultivator to the representative of the sugar factory in
question. That J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc necessarily would
mean that the seller cultivator would not be responsible for any damage or loss to the
sugarcane in question after he delivers the sugarcane to the representative of the
sugar factory in question. It would not be his concern as to how and by which mode
the sugarcane so collected is transported by the buyer/sugar factory to his factory,
whether such transport is through a bullock cart, camel cart or by a motor truck or
whether such a vehicle is owned by the buyer himself or not. As far as the cultivator is
concerned his responsibility would cease when he delivers the severed sugarcane at
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 33The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
the Collecting Centre and obtains the receipt acknowledging the delivery thereof,
from the representative of the sugar factory. The general property over the goods
therefore would pass from the cultivator to the sugar factory at the moment of
delivery of the sugarcane in question by the cultivator to the Collecting Centre in
question. The passing of the property to the sugar factory at the Collecting centre
would not be affected by the fact that the crops in question are to be weighed at the
factory gate with the help of weigh bridge and therefore the title to the goods, viz.,
sugarcane, would be deemed to have been passed from the cultivator to the sugar
factory when the sugarcane severed from the farm are delivered by the cultivator to
the representative of the buyer-factory owner at the Collecting Centre in question. It
is by now well established that the delivery to the agent or the servant of the
buyer-factory owner would be sufficient to establish the transfer of title to the goods
from the seller to the buyer."
10) Then, reliance is placed on certain definitions under the Sale of Goods Act and it is submitted
that the concept of delivery is understood as the point of time when there is a change of the
possession of the goods in question from the seller to the buyer. Then, relying upon the definition of
the term "goods"
appearing in section 2(7) of the Sale of Goods Act, it is submitted that the Petitioners having agreed
to buy and the cultivator agreed to sell the sugarcane crop, much before its harvest, at a time when
the seeds were supplied, the agreement would be an J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc
agreement of sale and therefore, governed by the Sale of Goods Act. In para 36, Entry 54 of List II of
the VII th Schedule to the Constitution of India is referred and it is submitted that even though
Article 366(29A) is introduced in the Constitution of India, none of the six categories set out therein
would cover the transaction accomplished by the Petitioner. The term "purchase of sugarcane" will
have to be interpreted in the same manner as is done in the Sale of Goods Act. Throughout the
Petition, reliance is placed on the Sale of Goods Act to urge that the Petitioners effect purchase of
sugarcane at the moment when there is a transfer of property from the cultivator to them and that
would be only when the sugarcane severed is delivered to the Collecting Centre or to the
representative of the factory owner/Petitioners.
It is at that time the sale by the cultivator and the purchase by the factory owner would be complete.
The culmination of that transaction does not depend on the later weighment at the weigh bridge,
which is to be done only for the purpose of proper accounting and quantification of the amount
payable to the concerned cultivator. The reference is then made to the procedure adopted by sugar
factories in the State of Maharashtra and it is complained that for the reason best known to the
Commissioner (Respondent No. 2), there is a misinterpretation of the provisions of the Act. That is
how uncalled for and J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc unwarranted additions are
made to the consideration agreed to be paid to the cultivator. The Petitioners have been submitting
their returns, but the complaint is that though there is a provision of assessment in the Act, there is
no assessment made for the period covered by the amendment with effect from 1 st October, 1995.
Though there was no such assessment, Respondent No. 3, by his letter dated 19 th October, 1996,
called upon the Petitioners to provide the information sought therein.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 34The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
He called upon the Petitioner to furnish details and asserted that the sugarcane cost should include
the cane harvesting expenses as also the expenses incurred for transporting the same. He therefore
calls upon the Petitioners to furnish the details of amount spent on cane harvesting and the
expenses incurred for transportation in the season 1995-96 so that he can ascertain the amount of
cane purchase tax payable by the Petitioners. He also directed that information be provided about
purchase tax payable during the month of May, 1996, June, 1996 and July, 1996.
Annexure 'D' is a copy of this letter.
11) Following the letter at Annexure 'D', there is another letter dated 5th November, 1996, under
which, Respondent No. 3 informed the Petitioner that certain amount of purchase tax was due in the
month of May and June, 1996 in respect of 1995-96 J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc
season and the purchase tax on harvesting and transport expenses also was required to be paid. The
Petitioners were also called upon to submit the Treasury Challan, failing which, the third
Respondent threatened coercive action. The original letters in Marathi and their English translation
are referred. It is stated that the letter of 5th November, 1996 was followed by similar letters in
January, 1997, copies of which are at Annexures 'E' and 'E1'.
12) Since Respondent No. 1 had threatened to take coercive measures on the basis of interpretation
of the provisions of the Act of 1962 that the Petitioners are constrained to challenge the vires of the
Act and the legality and validity of the aforementioned letters. It is on this footing and by raising
several grounds in para 41 that this Writ Petition has been filed.
13) On this Writ Petition, an order of admission was made on 24th June, 1997. The Respondents
were given time to file affidavit and an affidavit in reply has been filed by the Joint Commissioner of
Sales Tax (Profession Tax), Pune Zone, Pune.
14) It is stated in this affidavit that prior to the amendment made in the Act of 1962, the scheme of
the Act was to levy tax on the basis of weight of the sugarcane. There were J.V.Salunke,PA
WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc disparities in prices of sugarcane paid by Sakhar Karkhanas to the
cultivator in different areas. Though the prices were above the support price and therefore in any
area where the prices were paid less to the cultivator, the Karkhana had to bear the same burden of
tax as compared to the Karkhanas which pay higher prices for sugarcane. In order to remove
disparity and ensure social justice, the amendments were carried out from 1 st October, 1995 to
change the structure of taxation. Though it is stated that the Petitioner has not challenged the
legality and validity of the amended provisions, it is apparent that after the affidavit was filed, one
opposing admission on 20th June, 1997 and the other on 13th April, 2010, the amendments have
been made to the Writ Petition. Thus, the validity of the amended provisions has also been
challenged. The Commissioner asserts that the field of legislation in respect of the levy of tax on sale
or purchase of goods is set out in Entry 54 of List II of the 7 th Schedule to the Constitution of India.
The Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1959 is enacted by the legislature for levy of Sales Tax on goods. Entry 44
of Schedule 'A' of the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1959 gives exemption to the levy of tax on sale and
purchase of sugarcane. The tax on purchase of the sugarcane is under the Act of 1962. It is therefore
within the field of legislation provided by Item No. 54 of the List II of the VIIth Schedule to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 35The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
Constitution of India.
J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc
15) The Commissioner explains that the amounts spent for transport charges will also form a part of
the purchase price which is very clear from the language of the definition. It is submitted that the
argument and challenge that if transport charges are paid by the factory, the same shall not form
part of the purchase price is no longer available in view of the clear language of the definition. It is
urged that there is no substance in the challenge to clause (iii) of section 2(f-b) of the Act of 1962. It
is urged that the Petitioner is creating an unnecessary controversy. The argument is that amount of
harvesting charges spent by the factory for harvesting the standing crop on the field of the farmers
should not form part of purchase price, since the same has not been charged. However, by the
amended definition the word "charge" has been substituted by word "spent" in clause
(iii) of section 2(f-b). Even when it is not charged separately by any farmer since amendment is
effective from 1st October, 1995 though amount has been paid by the Karkhana, it will form part of
the purchase price. The argument that the expenses incurred have been brought in and the tax is not
on purchase of sugarcane but expenditure incurred is dealt with in the subsequent paragraphs of
this affidavit. It is submitted that question of jurisdiction to determine any amount of tax cannot be
raised inasmuch as the power conferred on the officers under sections 3 J.V.Salunke,PA
WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc and 4 of the Act of 1962 to levy and collect the purchase tax is within
the constitutional field. Therefore, the impugned notices are legal and valid. Further, on the basis of
these notices, assessment orders are also passed on 30 th March, 2007.
Thereafter, the Petitioner preferred Appeals against these orders and the Appeals were also decided
on 5th February, 2008 by the appellate authority. It is in these circumstances that the information
was sought by the letters addressed in November, 1996 and January, 1997. Once the tax has been
levied legally and validly, then, the amount thereof can be demanded by the officers and if that
demand is not satisfied, they are justified in recovering the tax by coercive means. For these reasons
and when the levy is constitutional and valid, the impugned communications and letters cannot be
questioned and set aside.
16) It is explained that the expenses incurred are treated as a purchase price and the tool of
calculation of purchase price cannot be said to be tax on expenses. In these circumstances, there is
no merit in the Petitions and it should be dismissed.
17) Then, and upon the amendment to the Writ Petitions,, an affidavit has also been filed in Writ
Petition No. 2364 of 1999 filed by the Ravalgaon Sugar Farm Limited. Independently, this Writ
Petition is raising an identical challenge. The reply, J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc
therefore, is in identical terms. The same principles are relied upon to support the levy. Hence, we
need not refer to the facts in the other Petitions in detail. Similarly, in other Petitions, which were
heard along with Writ Petition No. 2060 of 1997, the challenge being identical, the pleadings are
identical. Some of the Petitions have been called from the Benches of this Court at Aurangabad.

18) Mr. P. C. Joshi, learned Counsel led the arguments on behalf of the Petitioners. His arguments
were adopted by others and they only made some factual additions thereto. It would be
advantageous to refer to the arguments of Mr. Joshi.
19) Mr. Joshi contends that if the Act originally enacted and later on amended is perused, it would
be evident that the same seeks to include the amounts spent or the expenditure incurred. Once the
amount spent by the cultivator is sought to be made the basis of the levy, then, that necessarily
means the expenditure incurred by the cultivator before delivery would be forming part of the
purchase price. In other words, criticizing the definitions in section 2(f-a) (f-b)(ii), Mr. Joshi would
submit that if these definitions and the sub-clauses therein are read together, it would mean that the
aggregate of the amounts of purchase price paid as provided by section 2(g-a) is not the
determinative J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc or conclusive test. The attempt is to
include other sums or amounts incurred or spent. That is not contemplated by law. He would
submit that section 2(f-b)(ii) is not applicable to the factory. The sugar factory cannot be said to be
spending the amount towards transport of sugarcane. The Revenue's interpretation that this forms
part of the purchase price necessarily is therefore erroneous. After referring to sections 6, 7(1) and
the impugned communications, Mr. Joshi would submit that the letters and communications are
without authority of law.
There cannot be any demand and recovery of tax prior to the assessment. The demand should be
crystallized and ascertained.
That would be only on adjudication. Once the adjudication is not done, then, no coercive recovery
can be effected. Mr. Joshi was at pains to invite our attention to pages 66-A, namely the Ordinance
VI of 1998. He would also refer to the compilation Volume - I of which relevant documents form
part to submit that each and every amount cannot be taken into consideration. The amount taxed is
on expenditure and therefore beyond the competence of the State legislature. Mr. Joshi emphasises
Entry 54 of List II of VIIth Schedule to the Constitution of India, the language of section 2(1),
section 18 and other provisions of the Sale of Goods Act to submit that the severance, harvesting or
cutting expenses cannot be included in the definition of the term "purchase price". The
J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc Petitioners are not concerned with the delivery of
the crop because their factories are set up to manufacture or produce sugar from sugarcane crop
supplied to it. If this is understood, then, in pith and substance, the subject tax is on expenditure.
That is how the word "spent" has been used.
20) Mr. Joshi then submits that the Ordinance has no saving clause. The impugned letters cannot be
saved by the amendments. Mr. Joshi has referred to the full text of Maharashtra Act XX of 2002. He
would submit that section 1(2)
(a) of this Maharashtra Tax Laws (Levy and Amendment) Act, 2002, Maharashtra Act XX of 2002
refers to the amendments to the Act of 1962. He would submit that these amendments do not
restore the earlier position.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 37The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
21(A) Mr. Joshi's contentions can be summarised as under:-
The aforesaid Act was amended on more than one occasion but in the Petition, the
amendment by the Maharashtra Tax Laws (Levy and Amendment) Act, 1995 with
effect from 1 st October, 1995 and the subsequent amendments by the Maharashtra
Ordinance VI of 1998 read with Maharashtra Act 20 of 2002 and the Exemption
Notification under section 12B of the said Act dated 29th March, 2003 read with
Circular No. 12T of 2003 dated 31st March, 2003 coupled with the amendment by the
J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc Maharashtra Act 8 of 2003 dated
29th March, 2003 are questioned. The Petition also challenges the validity and
correctness of the latest circular issued by the commissioner of Sales Tax dated 23rd
November, 2009 being Trade Circular No. 31T of 2009 on various grounds set out in
the Petition as amended.
21(B) Under the provisions of the Central Act No. 10 of 1955 i.e. the Essential Commodities Act,
1955 the term "food crops" is defined to include the "sugarcane crop" also. As contemplated under
the said Act, the Central Government issued the Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966 from time to time
fixing the price for sugarcane payable by the sugar factory to the sugarcane grower. Accordingly, the
Sugar Control Order was issued on 22 nd November, 1996 for the relevant period. In addition to the
price fixed by the Central Government under the provisions of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955,
the impact of Sale of Goods Act will also have to be considered for determining the legality of the
amendments impugned before this Court.
21(C) The procedure adopted by the sugar factories during the relevant period has been succinctly
mentioned in paras 28 to
33. In a nutshell, it can be mentioned that the Petitioner had established various crop growing
centres in the vicinity of the J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc field of the grower
concerned so as to have quick delivery of the sugarcane at such centres.
21(D) The levy of purchase tax on the purchase price of sugarcane is covered by Entry 54 of List II to
Schedule VII of the Constitution of India. However, the field mentioned therein over which the State
legislature can provide for levy of tax on sale or purchase of goods, do not cover the tax on expenses,
that may or may not have been incurred by the sugar factory after the event of purchase was
completed at the crop growing centres where the property over the sugarcane severed from the farm
was intended to be transferred to the Petitioner by the cultivator upon delivering the crop to the
Petitioner's agent at the respective crop growing centres. The general property over the sugarcane
severed from the farm was thus affected by respective cultivator, did not depend on the later
weighment of the crops so purchased at the factory gate, solely for the purpose of effecting the
payment to the cultivator concerned.
21(E) As per the then existing law, the Petitioner submitted the returns periodically and paid the
purchase tax on the purchase price. However, disregarding the submissions of the Petitioners, the
orders of assessment were passed under section 7 of the Act. Since the stand of the Respondent was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 38The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
unsupported by J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc any law, the present Petition was
submitted challenging those orders of assessment alongwith the legality of amendments and the
circulars mentioned herein above.
21(F) Much before the orders of assessment that were passed, the Petitioner was being continuously
pressurised with directions by the Respondent to make the payment of purchase tax on sugarcane
purchase also on the expenses incurred for transportation of the sugarcane from the crop growing
centre to its factory by adding harvesting and transport expenses to the actual consideration paid by
the Petitioner to the cultivators as purchase price from time to time.
21(G) After amendment through the Maharashtra Act XVI of 1995, with effect from 1 st October,
1995, the Governor of Maharashtra issued an Ordinance bearing No. VI of 1998 on 1 st May, 1998
whereby the purchase amount "charged" wherever it appeared in the entire enactment, was deemed
to be substituted from 1st October, 1995 by the word "spent". That also has been challenged through
the amendment to the Petition under the permission granted by this Court on 23 rd April, 2010.
According to the Petitioner, the Ordinance in question was issued solely with the purpose of
frustrating the present Petition by disturbing the provisions brought in the enactment from 1 st
October, 1995 by J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc the Maharashtra Tax Laws (Levy
and Amendment) Act, 1995.
(Act XV1 of 1995). The said Ordinance VI of 1998 did not contain any validating and saving clause,
therefore the impugned three letters being Exhibits 'D', 'E' and 'E1' be declared as without
jurisdiction.
21(H) In addition thereto, the State Government having realised the position of law regarding its
competency to charge purchase tax on the expenses incurred by the Petitioner in respect of
transportation and other expenses; by including such expenses to be part of the purchase price; by
the Maharashtra Tax Law (Levy and Amendment) Act, 2002 the definition of "purchase price" so
amended with effect from 1 st October, 1995 was deleted with effect from 1st May, 2002 by deleting
the definitions under clause (f-a), (f-b) and (g-a). The procedure of levying purchase tax that was
adopted prior to 1 st October, 1995 was resorted to by the said Levy and Amendment Act, 2002.
That amendment also have been inserted and referred to in the petition by the additional clause No.
(h-a).
21(I) It is shocking to note that overlooking the Civil Application No. 530 of 2010 submitted on 4th
February, 2010, by the Petitioner seeking permission to amend the Petition, the Respondent, by its
additional affidavit in reply dated 13 th April, J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc 2010,
referred only to the amendment by Ordinance No. VI of 1998 dated 1st May, 1998 conveniently
ignoring the later developments of deleting the relevant definitions and restoring the earlier method
of levying tax.
21(J) It is worthwhile to note that in the Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the
Maharashtra Tax Law (Levy and Amendment) Act, 2002, nothing is mentioned as to why the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 39The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
definition clauses inserted from 1 st October, 1995 were deleted by the said Amendment Act.
21(K) The Petitioner would like to mention herein that sections 10 to 12 of the said Maharashtra
(Levy and Amendment) Act, 2002 were relevant for the purpose of the present Petition. The
amendments related to the deletion of the definition clauses (f-a), (f-b) and (g-a), substitution of
section 3 and amendment of section 6 by the said Amendment Act deleting, substituting and
amending certain provisions. The amendment was brought into force with effect from 1 st May,
2002 by virtue of the provisions of section 2(a) of the said Maharashtra Act 20 of 2002. In the
memorandum of delegated legislation, appended to the said Amendment Act 20 of 2002, it has been
expressly mentioned that the Act of 1962 was being amended to replace the ad-volarem duty on
purchase of sugarcane by a specific duty.
J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc 21(L) In their additional affidavit of reply, the
Respondents have also overlooked the later amendment by the Maharashtra Act 8 of 2003 and
subsequent Notification dated 29 th March, 2003. Under the powers conferred by the amended
section 12B, the said Notification expressly exempted the purchase of sugarcane effected by the
occupier of a factory from whole of tax if the sugar factory had exported the sugar manufactured by
it during nine months from 1st January, 2002 to 30th September, 2002. While in case of other
sugarcane purchases made during the period from 1st May, 2002 to 30the September, 2002, tax on
cost of cutting and transport charges purported to be forming part of the purchase price of
sugarcane; was exempted without any condition; in case of purchases from 1 st October, 2002 to
31st March, 2003, the same were completely exempted under Entry 3 of the said Notification dated
29th March, 2003.
21(M) The said development was clarified by the Commissioner of Sales Tax under Circular 12T of
2003. In addition thereto, the said circular also confirmed the fact that the amendment through
sections 10, 11 and 12 of the Maharashtra Act 20 of 2002 were brought into force with effect from 1
st May, 2002. The said circular, however, misinterpreted the amendments by the Maharashtra Act 8
of 2003. The amendment J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc to section 2 of the
Amendment Act 20 of 2002 was construed to mean that such an amendment automatically
amended the duly amended provisions of sections of the main Act by sections 10, 11 and 12 of the
Amendment Act, which already became part of the main enactment with effect from 1st May, 2002.
21(N) Such an erroneous version by the Respondent was again repeated by another Trade Circular
31T of 2009 dated 23 rd November, 2009. Under the said Circular, the Respondents have gone a
step further by mentioning that the deleted provisions of the Act 20 of 2002 stood restored by the
later Amendment Act 8 of 2003 with retrospective effect from 1 st May, 2002, without appreciating
the true and correct legal position that the amended sections of the main Act, which were already
brought into force and thus formed part of the main enactment, cannot be deemed to have been
restored automatically by the later Amendment Act 8 of 2003. Under the circumstances, the
Petitioner submits that the provisions deleted, amended and substituted with effect from 1st May,
2002 by the Maharashtra Act 20 of 2002 continued on the statute book unaffected by Act 8 of 2003
and therefore no tax can be levied on the expenses from the amounts spent by the Petitioner.
Accordingly, Rule be made absolute with due relief in terms of prayers (a), (b), (b1), (b2), (c) and (d)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 40The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
of the Petition.
J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc 21(O) Mr. Joshi has relied upon the following

22(A) On the other hand, Mr. V. A. Sonpal, learned Special Counsel appearing for the State and the
Respondents submitted that there is no substance in all the contentions of Mr. Joshi and other
Counsel. Mr. Sonpal would submit that essentially amendments made in 1995 related to addition of
definition of "purchase price" in section 2 (f-a), (f-b) and (f-c) so as to include J.V.Salunke,PA
WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc transportation expenses and other expenses spent by the dealer
(there is no ambiguity as to spent by who since tax is on the sugar factory, spent word relates to the
sugar factory and not grower).
The hitherto amendment in 1995 was leviable on weight basis and from 1995, basis of levy of tax is
changed to ad-volarem.
Though there is no challenge to ad-volarem levy of purchase tax, real grievance is of adding the
amount spent on transportation and money spent for any thing done before delivery of the
sugarcane to the dealer. The challenge is only on the basis of measure for the purpose of calculating
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 41The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
the percentage of purchase price. In other words, the challenge is the method of calculating the sale
price to include amount spent as stated above in purchase price.
22(B) The answer to the challenge is no more res-integra. In "Goodrick Group's case" followed by
case of "Bombay Tyre International" of the Hon'ble Supreme Court the ratio of which is applied in
the judgment in case of Baramati Grapes Ltd. It is clearly held that the measure of tax and incidence
of tax are different. If the levy is relatable to field of legislation, in present case, Entry 54 of 7th
Schedule to the Constitution of India the State or Center has full, unbriddled power to fix the
measure of tax that is to what will be basis of calculating tax.
J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc 22(C) In several cases as per compilation given
separately, in case of sugarcane, the State has power to include harvesting and transportation
charges to the agreed or disbursed price is upheld. Sugarcane is a controlled commodity and as per
Sugarcane Order each year published by the Central Government fair and reasonable price for
sugarcane is declared. As per Sugarcane Control Order, 1966 and more particularby clause 3A
proviso (iv) as amended from time, to time it is permissible for the sugar factory to deduct the
expenses for transportation and harvesting from the fair price. The fair price that is declared is
agreed customarily by the grower in his agreement with sugar factory, in writing, that supply will as
per the price declared by the Central Government and deductions for the harvesting expenses and
transportation expenses are agreed to be deducted from fair price. Hence, going by the principles
that disbursement or adjustment does not affect the purchase price at which tax is to be levied. It is
therefore submitted that there is no extraneous or alien or irrelevant or unreasonable consideration
for inclusion of expenses prior to delivery and transportation expenses to be included in the
purchase price.
22(D) So far as vires of the amendments are concerned, suffice it to say that none of the grounds
propounded by the J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc Petitioner merit consideration.
22(E) The field of legislation under Entry 54 for State includes making provisions for every
incidental thing including enforcement and recovery, levy of penalty etc. Besides, it is well settled
that when a power is conferred in the legislature to levy tax, that power itself must be widely
construed. It must include the power to impose a tax and select the articles or commodities for the
exercise of such power. It must likewise include the power to fix the rate and prescribe the
machinery for the recovery of the tax. This power also gives jurisdiction to the legislature to make
such provisions as, in its opinion, would be necessary to prevent the evasion of the tax. In imposing
taxes, the legislature can also appoint authorities for collecting taxes and may prescribe the
procedure for determining the amount of taxes payable by any individual, all the provisions are
subsidiary to the main power to levy a tax and, therefore, once it is shown that the tax in question
has been levied on goods carried, it would be open to the legislature to prescribe the machinery for
recovering the said tax.
22(F) If the impugned legislation invades Entry 52, it must be repelled by this Court. But, Entry 54
in List II of the 7 th Schedule empowers the State to legislate for taxes on purchase of goods and if
that is attracted, in pith and substance by the Entry, J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 42The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
legislative incompetence cannot void the Act. What matters is not the name of the Act but its real
nature, its pith and substance.
Tax on sale or purchase must be on the occurrence of a taxing event of a sale transaction. Beyond
that is left to the free play of the legislature, subject, of course, to the contra-indications about
capricious, arbitrary or irrational features. It is a situation, cultivated by familiarity to consider that
all sales tax must necessarily have nexus with the price of the commodity. Of course, price as basis is
not only usual but also safe to avoid uneven, unequal burdens, although it is conceivable that a
legislature can regard prices which fluctuate frequently, as too impractical to tailor the purchase tax.
It may even be, in rare cases, iniquitous to link purchase tax with price, if more sensible bases can be
found. The practice has been to impose purchase tax by weight of cane. Also, in weight of cane its
sucrose content and its price have a close nexus, although, theoretically, they may appear
unconnected.
22(G) Simply because the method for quantifying the tax is by reference and determinable to the
expenses of the transportation and other expenses before delivery, it is not a tax on expenses.
J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc 22(H) The bottom line of the said doctrine is to look
at the legislation as a whole and if it has a substantial connection with the entry, the matter may be
taken to be legislation on the topic.
22(I) The nomenclature of a levy is not conclusive for deciding its true character and nature. For
deciding the true character and nature of a particular levy, with reference to the legislative
competence, the Court has to look into the pith and substance of the legislation.
22(J) The statute enacted by Parliament or a State legislature cannot be declared unconstitutional
lightly. The Court must be able to hold beyond any iota of doubt that the violation of the
constitutional provisions was so glaring that the legislative provision under challenge cannot stand.
Sans a flagrant violation of the constitutional provisions, the law made by Parliament or a State
legislature is not declared bad.
22(K) Ordinary laws have to answer two tests for their validity: (1) the law must be within the
legislative competence of the legislature as defined and specified in Chapter I, part XI of the
Constitution, and (2) it must not offend against the provisions of Articles 19, 13(1) and (2) of the
Constitution.
J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc 22(L) When a law is impugned on the ground that it
is ultra vires the powers of the legislature which enacted it, what has to be ascertained is the true
character of the legislation. To do that one must have regard to the enactment as a whole, to its
objects and to the scope and effect of its provisions. If on such examination it is found that the
legislation is in substance one on a matter assigned to the legislature, then, it must be held to be
valid in its entirety, even though it might incidentally trench on matters which are beyond its
competence. It would be quite an erroneous approach to the question to view such a statute not as
an organic whole, but as a mere collection of sections, then, disintegrate it into parts, examine under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 43The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
what heads of legislation those parts would severally fall, and by that process determine what
portions thereof are intra vires and what are not.

of the Act of 1962. They have also challenged the legality and validity of the three letters so also the
Exemption Notification under section 12B dated 29 th March, 2003 Annexure 'H' read with Circular
No. 12T of 2003 at Annexure 'I' dated 31st March, 2003. The Petitioners have also challenged the

amendment of the Maharashtra Act 8 of 2003.
24) The Petitioners also state that the Maharashtra Act IX of 1962 is an Act to provide for the levy
and collection of a tax on purchase of sugarcane for use in the "manufacture of sugar" and which
words were then substituted with the words "manufacture or production of sugar including
Khandsari Sugar". The Statement of Objects and Reasons leading to the enactment are relevant and
some of the clauses thereof are reproduced herein below:-
"STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS.
The Supreme Court in the case of Diamond Sugar Mills Ltd. versus State of Uttar
Pradesh (1961) I. S. C. J. 652, held the U. P. Sugarcane Cess Act, 1956, ultra vires and
beyond the competence of the State Legislature. Parliament thereupon enacted the U.
P. Sugarcane Cess (Validation) Act, 1961 (4 of 1961) to protect the taxes collected
under the U. P. Act. Later, Parliament enacted the Sugarcane Cess (Validation) Act,
1961 (38 of 1961) to protect similar levies collected under other State laws which were
also affected by the aforesaid judgment. The latter Act, which inter alia protects the
imposition and collection of the cess on entry of sugarcane into the premises of a
factory for use therein, under the Bombay Sugarcane Cess Act, 1948 (Bom. LXXXII of
1948), was proposed to be brought into force in this State with effect J.V.Salunke,PA
WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc from 31st December 1961. As thereafter it was not
possible to collect the tax on sugarcane, it was necessary to take immediate action to
levy, with effect from 1st January 1962, a purchase tax on sugarcane purchased by
factories for the manufacture of sugar to make up the loss of revenue due to cessation
of the Sugarcane Cess Act from that date. As both Houses of the State Legislature
were not in session, the Maharashtra Ordinance No. V of 1961 was promulgated by
the Governor on the 30 th December 1961. The Bill seeks to replace the Ordinance by
an Act of the State Legislature, subject to a few formal modifications."
25) The above material is necessary to understand the backdrop and the context in which the Act
came to be enacted.
Some of the definitions as found in the Act of 1962 were amended by the Maharashtra Act 21 of 1998
with effect from 1 st May, 1998 and are reproduced. Since heavy reliance has been placed on the
definitions of the terms "factory", "licence", "occupier", "purchase", "purchase price" and "turnover
of purchases", we reproduce these definitions hereinbelow:-
"2(b) "factory" means any premises (including the precincts thereof), wherein twenty
or more workers are working and in which, or in any part of which any
manufacturing process connected with the production of sugar by means of vacuum
pans is being carried on, or ordinarily carried on, with the aid of power.
2(c) "licence" means a licence granted or renewed under this Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 46The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
2(d) "occupier" of a factory of or a unit means the person who has ultimate control
over the affairs of the factory of the unit and where the said affairs are entrusted to a
managing agent, such agent shall be deemed to be the occupier of the factory or of the
unit, as the case may be; and the term includes also any person appointed by the
occupier to act as a purchasing agent.
J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc 2(f-a) "purchase" means a purchase
of sugarcane made within the State for cash or deferred payment or other valuable
consideration and includes any supply by a shareholder to a co-operative society or
limited company for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration.
2(f-b) "purchase price" means aggregate of the following sums, -
(i) the amount of valuable consideration paid or payable by the occupier for purchase
of sugarcane made by the factory or by the unit;
(ii) the amount spent towards transport of sugarcane (whether separately spent or
not); and
(iii) any other sum spent for anything done in respect of the sugarcane at the time of
or before delivery thereof.
2(g-a)"turnover of purchases" means the aggregate to the amounts of purchase price paid and
payable by an occupier during a given period.
26) These definitions indicate as to how the reference is to a factory where manufacturing process
connected with the production of sugar and by the means set out in the definitions is undertaken. A
licence is required for purchasing sugarcane for use in the manufacture or production of sugar and
that is granted under the Act. The term "occupier" is defined so that an officer is identified for the
purposes of discharging several obligations in terms of the Act. The term "purchase" is defined so
that it would be understood as a deal within the State for cash or deferred payment or other valuable
consideration. It includes any supply by a shareholder of the Co-operative Society or limited
company by similar mode. Thus, purchase by the manufacturer or producer of sugar directly and
any supply by shareholder of the J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc manufacturing or
producing company or Co-operative Society by the aforestated modes is brought within the purview
of the Act.
The term "purchase price" means aggregate of the sums referred to in the sub clauses of the
definition of the term "purchase price".
The word "aggregate" means total amount or sum total. It is understood as composed of several,
combined whole. It also means to collect into a whole (see "Advanced Law Lexicon by P. Ramanatha
Aiyar 3rd Edition Reprint 2007").
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 47The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
27) The term purchase price, therefore, means the total of the amount of valuable consideration paid
or payable by the occupier for purchase of sugarcane made by the factory or by the unit, the
amounts spent towards transport of sugarcane, whether separately spent or not. The word "spent" is
substituted for the word "charged" and shall be deemed to have been substituted with effect from 1st
October, 1995 by the Maharashtra Act 21 of 1998. It also means any other sum spent or anything
done in respect of the sugarcane at the time of the delivery thereof. The term turnover of purchase
has been defined once again by using the word "aggregate". It means the sum total of the amounts of
purchase price paid and payable by an occupier during the given period. Thus, by the charging
section 3, it is stated that there shall be levied and collected a tax on the turnover of purchase of
J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc sugarcane. It is such sugarcane purchased for the
use thereof in the manufacture or production of sugar in the factory or unit on which the tax is
levied and collected. The rates thereof are to be specified in terms of sections 2 and 3 and the tax as
levied is payable by the occupier at such intervals and in such manner as may be prescribed.
28) We have also to consider other provisions of the Act, for, they have a bearing on the charge and
levy of the purchase tax.
By section 5, it is mandated that except under and in accordance with law, conditions of a licence
issued by the Commissioner, no person shall purchase any sugarcane for the purpose of the use
thereof in the manufacture or production of sugar in a factory or a unit. By the sub-sections of this
section 5 as also by sub section (1) of section 6, it is apparent that the licence is for purchasing
sugarcane for the purpose of use thereof in the manufacturing or production of sugar in a factory or
a unit.
By sub section (1) of section 6, every occupier liable to pay tax under this Act is obliged to file a
return in the prescribed form and showing a turnover of purchases of sugarcane purchased by him
for above use. Thus, upon a licence being issued, sugarcane can be purchased and for use in the
manufacture or production of sugar in the factory or unit. The occupier of factory is obliged to
J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc file a return depicting above details. The provision
following the same, namely, assessment and collection of tax would indicate as to how a
Commissioner shall assess the tax and by a single order of assessment payable in respect of the
period, in any year to which all the returns under section 6 collectively relate. If the amount has
already not been paid, then, the Commissioner shall issue a notice and serve it by requiring the
payment of the amount assessed. The consequences of not filing the return are set out in sub section
(2) of section 7. By section 7A, penalty is provided for failure without reasonable cause to submit a
return as required and by sub section (1) of section 7B, interest payable by occupier in certain cases
is set out. The provision of Appeal under section 8 and Revision under section 9 would indicate that
a complete machinery for assessment and collection of tax is provided in the Act.
29) On a reading of the provisions together and harmoniously, we are not in agreement with Mr.
Joshi that the tax is on expenses or expenditure and not on purchase of sugarcane. The above
provisions have been minutely referred by us together with those enabling recovery of tax. There is a
inherent fallacy in the submission of the Petitioners that components which are not germane or
relevant to the purchase of J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc sugarcane and the price
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 48The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
paid therefor are taken into consideration by the legislature. It is apparent that the term "purchase
price" is defined in such a way as to include amounts mentioned in sub-clauses (i) to (iii) of section
2(f-b) of the Act of 1962. Once it is apparent that the components or elements stated therein go into
fixation of purchase price and that is the measure for computation of the tax, then, depending upon
facts and circumstances in each case, the occupier can point out that not all components or elements
are included in the purchase price in his case. That it is only the actual costs which have been taken
into account or that they have not included all the heads simply because not all of them form part of
the purchase price. Then, it would be open for the Assessing Officer/Commissioner to consider such
pleas and material in support thereof. He would, then, compute the tax liability after duly
considering them. However, it is the turnover of purchases meaning the aggregate of the amounts of
purchase price paid and payable by an occupier, on which tax is levied and collected. The turnover is
computed on the basis of the purchase transactions and the price paid for the same. Thus, it would
be open for the Petitioners to point out that the turnover of purchases in their case involves payment
of purchase price without the elements that are set out in the definition of the term "purchase price"
referred above. In the J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc event the Assessing
Officer/Commissioner does not agree with the Petitioner, then, there are remedies open in law. We
cannot presume on the strength of the arguments of the Petitioners' Counsel that the tax is not on
turnover of purchase of sugarcane, but on expenditure or amount incurred on cultivation and supply
of sugarcane. Thus, expenses of this nature incurred by the factory or unit is the measure of the tax
according to the Counsel.
However, the levy of tax cannot be confused with the measure of tax. The levy is on purchase of
sugarcane used for manufacture or production of sugar in a factory or unit. If that is the transaction
or dealing on which the tax is levied and for such transaction or deal to be struck, a licence is
required, then, all the more we cannot agree with Mr. Joshi.
30) Mr. Joshi's arguments as noted above are based on paras 28 to 33 of the Petition argued by him.
We are not going by individual facts and circumstances of each Petitioner/factory. It could be open
for it to point out to the Assessing Officer during the course of arguments that its mode of
acquisition or purchase of sugarcane is as explained in the paragraphs 28 to 33 of Writ Petition No.
2060 of 1997 or somewhat different or distinct thereto. It could also be pointed out that all the
elements or components of determination of purchase price are not taken J.V.Salunke,PA
WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc care of in the individual sugar factory's determination of purchase
price. Thus, it is not compensating for the costs allegedly incurred by the cultivator or farmer or
supplier and that is how it would be in a position to convince the Assessing Officer about the
computation of the tax and the liability in pursuance thereof. It must at once be noticed that the
definition of the term "purchase price" takes within its fold the amount of valuable consideration
paid or payable by the occupier for the purchase of sugarcane made by the factory or by the unit. It
could also include or be an aggregate of the sums such as amounts paid towards transport of
sugarcane whether separately spent or not and any other sum spent for anything done in respect of
the sugarcane at the time of or before delivery thereof. Thus, the purchase price determined would
take care of all these expenses or expenditure, but they may be incurred by the transporter or such
other entity at the time or before delivery of the Sugarcane.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 49The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
It could be pointed out that the act of purchase of sugarcane was for cash or deferred payment or
other valuable consideration, but does not include a supply by a shareholder of the factory or limited
company. Therefore, it could be said that the supplier of sugarcane is not a shareholder. It could also
be said that the sugarcane is obtained from the farmer or cultivator directly and it is his
responsibility to reach the sugarcane, for which the J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc
purchase price is tendered, directly to the factory or unit where the production or manufacturing of
sugar is undertaken. The transporter may or may not be involved in such process. Equally, there
would not be any sum spent for anything done in respect of the sugarcane at the time of or before
delivery thereof. These expenses may be to the account of the cultivator or farmer. The
Assessee/factory is not required to compensate him for the same.
The computation of the purchase price is indicated so that the tax to be levied and collected is
correctly computed. If sum total of the purchases would constitute the turnover and the measure of
that would be the amount of purchase price paid and payable by an occupier during the given
period, then, it is only to enable the assessment and collection of tax in accordance with law that
these provisions have been inserted. Thus, we are in complete agreement with Mr. Sonpal on the
legality and validity of the tax.
It is not unconstitutional and ultra vires as alleged.
31) Mr. Joshi relied upon Entry 54 in the State List (List -
II), which enables the State to impose taxes on the sale or production of goods other than
newspapers, subject to the provisions of Entry 92A of List I. The argument is that the subject levy is
covered by this Entry. The further argument is that this Entry does not enable State legislature to
levy tax in J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc such a manner so as to cover expenses
that may or may not have been incurred. We are unable to accept this contention and for more than
one reason. The term "tax on the sale or purchase of goods" has also been defined in the
Constitution of India itself and by an amendment particularly by (Forty sixth Amendment Act,
1982). In Article 366 (29A), the term "tax on the sale or purchase of goods" is defined in a conclusive
manner as under:-
"366(29A) "tax on the sale or purchase of goods" includes
- (a) a tax on the transfer, otherwise than in pursuance of a contract, of property in
any goods for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;
(b) a tax on the transfer of property in goods (whether as goods or in some other
form) involved in the execution of a works contract;
(c) a tax on the delivery of goods on hire-purchase or any system of payment by
installments;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 50The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
(d) a tax on the transfer of the right to use any goods for any purpose (whether or not
for a specified period) for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;
(e) a tax on the supply of goods by any unincorporated association or body of persons
to a member thereof for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;
(f) a tax on the supply, by way of or as part of any service or in any other manner
whatsoever, of goods, being food or any other article for human consumption or any
drink (whether or not intoxicating), where such supply or service, is for cash,
deferred payment or other valuable consideration, and such transfer, delivery or
supply of any goods shall be deemed to be a sale of those goods by the person making
the transfer, delivery or supply and a purchase of those goods by the person to whom
such transfer, delivery or supply is made"
J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc
32) Therefore, a reading of the same would indicate as to how the tax could be on the delivery of
goods on hire purchase system or any system of payment of installments, it could be a tax on the
transfer of right to use any goods for any purpose for cash, deferred payment or valuable
consideration, a tax on the supply of goods by any incorporated association or body of persons to a
member thereof, a tax on the supply by way of or as a part of any service or in any manner
whatsoever of goods, being food or any other article for human consumption or any drink (whether
or not intoxicating), whether such supply is for cash, deferred payment or other valuable
consideration. The definition also clarifies that such transfer, delivery or supply of any goods shall
be deemed to be a sale of those goods by the person making the transfer, delivery or supply and a
purchase of those goods by the person to whom such transfer, delivery or supply is made. In the
circumstances, the subject tax does not go beyond Entry 54 of List - II (State List) to the Seventh
Schedule of the Constitution.
33) The other argument also need not detain us. That is that amendments which have been made
with effect from 1 st October, 1995 by Ordinance VI of 1998 issued on 1 st May, 1998 are also ultra
vires the Act. According to the Petitioners, the Ordinance was issued solely with a purpose of
frustrating a J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc challenge to the provisions brought in
the law from 1 st October, 1995. This argument has no substance, simply because an Act of the
competent legislature can be amended from time to time. It is presumed also in matters of
imposition of tax that the legislature understands and appreciates the economic realities. It
performs a balancing act and while plugging loopholes and removing defects and lacunas, it has full
freedom to make changes in the tax structure or in the process of assessment and collection of tax.
Therefore and in the absence of any constitutional prohibition, the legislature was not prevented
from amending the Act even during the pendency of these Petitions. Secondly, the executive is a sole
Judge of the urgency and if it is required to act expeditiously to subserve larger public interest, then,
it is equally empowered to issue an Ordinance. This contention therefore must be negatived.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 51The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
34) Then, the argument is that the Act, which was enacted in 1962, came to be amended. The
legislature in enacting the Amendment Act, stated that the Maharashtra Amendment Act 21 of 1998
would be effective from 1st October, 1995. Mr. Joshi would submit that Maharashtra Tax Laws (Levy
and Amendment) Act in Chapter VI refers to the Amendment to the Maharashtra Purchase Tax on
Sugarcane Act, 1962. It states J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc that the definition as
appearing in section 2(f-b) of the term "purchase price" in its sub clause would have the word
"spent"
instead of "charge" and it shall be deemed to have been substituted with effect from 1st October,
1995. Then, Mr. Joshi would submit that the Maharashtra Tax Laws (Levy and Amendment) Act,
2002 in Chapter I entitled 'Preliminary', particularly section 1(2)(a) thereof stated that sections 1 to
8, 10 to 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20 to 27 and 29 shall come into force on 1 st May, 2002 and by section
1(2)(b), it is stated that section 9, 16, 19 and 28 shall come into force on the dates expressly
mentioned in those sections. Mr. Joshi relied upon Chapter V of this Act, which contains
amendments to the Maharashtra Purchase Tax on Sugarcane Act, 1962. Chapter V reads as under:-
"CHAPTER V Amendments to the Maharashtra Purchase Tax on Sugarcane Act, 1962
10. Amendment of section 2 of Mah. IX of 1962. - In section 2 of the Maharashtra
Purchase Tax on Sugarcane Act, 1962 (hereinafter, in this Act, referred to as "the
Purchase Tax on Sugarcane Act"), clause (f-a), (f-b) and (g-
a) shall be deleted.
11. Substitution of section 3 of Mah. IX of 1962. -
For section 3 of the Purchase Tax on Sugarcane Act, the following section shall be substituted,
namely:-
3. Levy of purchase tax. - (1) There shall belevied and collected a tax on the purchase
of sugarcane being purchased for use in the manufacture or production of sugar in a
factory or a unit.
(2) The tax under sub-section (1) shall be levied at such rate per kilogram of sugarcane purchased
for the purpose aforesaid, as may be specified by the State J.V.Salunke,PA
WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, and different
rates may be specified for the sugarcane purchased for the manufacture or production of sugar in a
factory and of Khandsari sugar in a unit:
Provided that, different rates may also be specified for sugarcane purchased for the
manufacture or production of Khandsari sugar in units situated in areas, which are
declared by the State Government, from time to time, by notification in the Official
Gazette, as developed areas or undeveloped areas, so however that the rate or rates so
specified shall not exceed four paise per kilogram of sugarcane so purchased.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 52The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
(3) for the purpose of the levy of tax, as provided in sub-section (2), there shall be
deducted from the gross weight of sugarcane so purchased, such portion thereof
representing the average weight of the top of the sugarcane plant consisting of pith
devoid of any sugar content and leaves and other trash usually present in the
sugarcane, as may be prescribed; and the tax shall be levied only on the remaining
weight of the sugarcane after such deduction has been made.
(4) The tax levied under the foregoing sub-
sections shall be paid by the occupier of the factory or of the unit, as the case may be, at such
intervals and in such manner, as is hereinafter provided.
12. Amendment of section 6 of Mah. IX of 1962. - In section 6 of the Purchase Tax on Sugarcane Act,
in sub-
section (1), for the words "the turnover of purchase of" the words "in kilograms the total quantity of"
shall be substituted."
35) Thus, the argument is that these sections came into force on 1st May, 2002. In effect, it means
section 2(f-a), 2(f-b) and 2(g-a) from the Act of 1962 stood deleted. However, Mr. Joshi then invited
our attention to Maharashtra Act VIII of 2003, which is an Act to further amend certain Tax Laws in
operation in the State of Maharashtra and by which section 12B of the act of 1962 was substituted.
Section 4 of the Maharashtra Act VIII of 2003 reads as under:-
J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc "4. In section 1 of the Maharashtra
Tax Laws (Levy and Amendment) Act, 2002 in sub-section (2) -
(a) in clause (a), the figures and word "10 to 12" shall be deleted and shall be deemed
to have been deleted with effect from the 1st May 2002 and
(b) in clause (c), for the word and figures "section 13" the words and figures "sections
10 to 13" shall be substituted and shall be deemed to have been substituted with effect
from the 1st May, 2002."
36) The argument is that though this Act amends the Maharashtra Tax Laws (Levy
and Amendment) Act, 2002, insofar as the amendment relating to the Act of 1962,
the figures and words "10 to 12" stand deleted and shall be deemed to have been
deleted with effect from 1st May, 2002. Therefore, there is non application of mind
on the part of the authorities. It only means that the amendments which were already
brought into force were purported to be deleted. The amendments brought in by
Maharashtra Act VIII of 2003 could not have changed the amended provisions or
sections of the main Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 53The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
37) Mr. Sonpal has clarified that this is an improper reading of the amended
provisions. He would submit that the Act of 1962 was amended by the Maharashtra
Act XVI of 1995 with effect from 1st October, 1995 and the Maharashtra Act XIX of
1996 with effect from 9th June, 1996. It was amended by Maharashtra Act XXI of
1998 with effect from 1 st May, 1998.
Our attention is invited to these amendments carried out J.V.Salunke,PA
WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc particularly by the Maharashtra Act XVI of 1995. It is urged by Mr.
Sonpal that the Maharashtra Tax Laws (Levy and Amendment) Ordinance 1998 purported to amend
several provisions in the Maharashtra Tax Laws. Insofar as that Ordinance is concerned, it was later
on enacted as the Maharashtra Act XXI of 1998. The Maharashtra Act XXI of 1998, vide Chapter VI,
amended section 2(f-b) of the Act of 1962 and for the word "charge", wherever it occurred, the word
"spent"
stood substituted and is deemed to have been substituted with effect from 1st October, 1995. Mr.
Sonpal then invited our attention to the Maharashtra Tax Laws (Levy and Amendment) Act, 2002
and the amendments contained in Chapter V thereof proposing changes in the Act of 1962. That
deleted clauses (f-a), (f-b) and (g-a) in section 2 of the Act of 1962. It also substituted section 3 and
made certain changes in section 6 of the Act of 1962. However, the further Act to amend certain Tax
Laws in operation in the State of Maharashtra, namely Maharashtra Act VIII of 2003 substituted
section 12B for the earlier section in the Act of 1962 and clarified that the Maharashtra Tax Laws
(Levy and Amendment) Act, 2002 insofar as it amended the Act of 1962 and brought them into
effect from 1st May, 2002 shall be deemed to have been deleted with effect from 1 st May, 2002.
Thus, the amendment sought to be made to the Act of 1962 by the J.V.Salunke,PA
WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc Maharashtra Tax Laws (Levy and Amendment) Act, 2002 never
came into effect.
38) We find substance in the contentions of Mr. Sonpal, because by the 2002 Amendment Act, the
legislature, vide section 10 thereof, sought to delete section 2(f-a), (f-b) and (g-a) from the Act of
1962. Though that deletion came into effect from 1 st May, 2002, that provision was not brought
into force at all. That is how the Maharashtra Act VIII of 2003 reads. This Act of 2003 was first
published after its having received assent of the Governor, in the Maharashtra Government Gazette
on 29 th March, 2003. The impact of the same has been rightly understood that a levy on tax on
purchase of sugarcane will continue to be based on purchase price as is defined prior to 1st May,
2002. The substitution of the Maharashtra Act XXI of 1998 with effect from 1 st October, 1995 in
clause (f-b) with effect from 1st October, 1995 is unaffected.
That was sought to be affected by Chapter V of the Maharashtra Tax Laws (Levy and Amendment)
Act, 2002 with effect from 1 st May, 2002. However, the Maharashtra Amendment Act 2002 seeking
to amend the Act of 1962 itself stands deleted. That Chapter V of the Amendment Act, 2002 being
deleted on account of subsequent Maharashtra Act VIII of 2003, we do not see any change in the
position.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 54The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc
39) We are not impressed by the argument of Mr. Joshi that such amendments cannot be construed
to mean that provisions already brought into force and effected being deleted will not restore those
sections which have already been removed from the Statute Book. In other words, amendment to an
amendment already brought into effect would not restore the position prior to the first amendment.
The contention as raised in writing is that if a statute is first amended and by the second
amendment, the first amendment is deleted does not mean that the position prior to the first
amendment stands automatically restored.
40) Mr. Joshi sought to rely on the principle enunciated in Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes,
particularly laid down in 12th Edition on Commencement, Repeal and Revival of Legislation. He
would submit that where an Act is repealed and the repealing enactment is then repealed by
another, which manifests no intention that the original Act shall continue repealed, the common law
rule was that the repeal of the second Act revived the first ab-initio. However, according to the
Maxwell, the common law on the point was altered in 1850, by a provision now to be found in
section 11(1) of the Interpretation Act, 1889 to the effect that where an Act passed after 1850
J.V.Salunke,PA WP.2060.1997+.Judgment.doc repeals a repealing enactment, it shall not be
construed as reviving any enactment previously repealed, unless words are added reviving that
enactment. We have not been shown any such statutory prescription as far as India is concerned.
The principle that repeal of a repealing Act does not necessarily revive what is repealed by the
repealing Act thus cannot be stretched and applied to the present case. Rather the Principles of
Statutory Interpretation as summarised by Justice G. P. Singh in 13th Edition, 2012 would show
that the common law rule of revival has been abrogated by section 6(a) and 7 of the General Clauses
Act, 1897. However, we are not concerned with such a wider controversy. In the present case, the
amendment made by the Amendment Act of 1st May, 2002 did not come into effect at all. That has
been clarified now by the Maharashtra Act VIII of 2003. Once these amendments made with effect
from 1 st May, 2002 stood deleted from a prior date, then, the consequences are clear. No assistance
can be derived from the principle which Mr.Joshi seeks to apply. Now, it is apparent that if one
statute is repealed by a second which in turn is repealed by a third, the effect is to revive the first
statute unless a contrary indication is indicated in the third statute. In such circumstances, we do
not see any reason to accept the contentions of Mr. Joshi.

41) Further, in the case of Ameer-un-Nissa Begum and Ors. vs. Mahboob Begum and Ors. reported
in AIR 1955 SC 352, the Hon'ble Supreme Court settled the principles in the following words:-
".....
(24) The result will be the same even if we proceed on the footing that the various
'Firmans' issued by the Nizam were in the nature of legislative enactments
determining private rights somewhat on the analogy of private Acts of parliament.
We may assume that the 'Firman' of 26-6-1947 was repealed by the 'Firman' of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/131375618/ 55The Rahuri Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana ... vs The State Of Maharashtra on 22 December, 2015
24-2-1949 and the latter 'Firman' in its turn was repealed by that of 7-9-1949.
Under the English Common Law when a repealing enactment was repealed by another statute, the
repeal of the second Act revived the former Act 'ab initio'. But this rule does not apply to repealing
Acts passed since 1850 and now if an Act repealing a former Act is itself repealed, the last repeal
does not revive the Act before repealed unless words are added reviving it: vide Maxwell's
Interpretation of Statutes, p. 402 (10th Edition).
It may indeed be said that the present rule is the result of the statutory provisions introduced by the
Interpretation Act of 1889 and as we are not bound by the provisions of any English statute, we can
still apply the english Common Law rule if it appears to us to be reasonable and proper. But even
according to the Common Law doctrine, the repeal of the repealing enactment would not revive the
original Act if the second repealing enactment manifests an intention to the contrary. In the present
case the 'Firman' of 7-9-1949, does not repeal the earlier 'Firman' of 24-2-1949, 'simpliciter' but
makes a further provision providing for fresh enquiry and report which presupposes the
continuance of the repeal of the original 'Firaman' of 26-6-1947.
This being the position, we are constrained to hold that there was no final or effective decree in
existence subsequent to the issuing of the 'Firman' of 7-9-1949, and the execution proceedings
started by the respondents are, therefore, untenable in law. In the view that we are taking it becomes
unnecessary to discuss the third point raised by the Attorney General, namely, whether the City Civil
Court has jurisdiction to execute the decree.

42) Once all the legal submissions are taken care of and duly considered, then, on facts, we are not
required to go into the rival contentions. If the assessment is not in accordance with law or the
assessment is pending and not finalised in a given year, it would be open for the Petitioners to point
out that no notices of demand can be issued straight away unless the amount due and payable is
crystallised and ascertained. It is needless to clarify that unless the process is complete, recovery by
coercive means is not permissible in law. Therefore, we need not consider the legality and validity of
the demand notices in the light of this settled position in law. It would be open for the Petitioners to
resist the demand by all means provided in law. We are, therefore, not required to consider factual
aspects any further.
All the more, as the Department has understood the legal position correctly vide their Circular No.
23-T of 2003 dated 22 nd October, 2003. In paras 2 and 3 of this Circular, the Commissioner has
clarified that no letter making a demand shall be issued even in the form of request, unless the party
concerned is heard and appropriate statutory orders are passed. Though this is issued by the
Commissioner of Sales Tax, the principle would equally apply to the present case and levy.

43) In the light of the above, we are of the view that no factual aspects need to be gone into. In
individual cases, it would be open for the Petitioners to contest the computation of tax. It would be
open to produce such material as is permissible in law in the event the computation is erroneous
and illegal. All such remedies and contentions therein are kept open.
44) We have only dealt with the arguments on legality and validity of the levy and the provisions
with regard thereto. Since these contentions are negatived for the reasons as indicated above, each
of these Petitions fail. Rule is discharged in each of them, but without any order as to costs. In the
light of the dismissal of the Petitions, the Civil Applications do not survive and to stand disposed of
as such.
