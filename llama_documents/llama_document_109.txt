JUDGMENT
H.L. Anand, J.
(1) This judgment would dispose of C.R. 60/72, C.R. 04/72 and S.A.O. 30/73, which raise a common
question as to the circumstances in which a consignee may sue the Railways for compensation on
account of loss and/or damage to the goods, while in transit.
(2) C.R. 60/72 arises out of a suit filed by the respondents, M/s. Jashan Mal & Co., fruit and
vegetable Merchants, Subzimandi, Delhi for compensation on account of damage caused to a
consignment of mangoes booked from Vizianagaram Station to New Delhi over the Northern
Railway. The plaintiff was the consignee mentioned in the railway receipt. The suit was resisted on
behalf of the Union, inter alia, on the ground that the plainitiff, though a firm of commission agents
and a consignee mentioned in the receipt, was not the owner of the goods and could not sue. The
suit was decreed by the Judge Small Cause Court, Delhi. On the question of locus standi, the trial
Court held, relying on the case of Jalan and. Sons, Ltd. Air 1949 East Punjab 190(1) and the case of
Ghamandi Lal Naneh Mal, R.F.A. 18-D/1958 decided on March 1, 1967(2) that the plaintiff "being a
consignee can bring this suit for damages against Union of India". Aggrieved by the decree, the
Union of India has brought up the matter on a revision.
(3) C.R. 64/72 arises out of a suit filed by M/s. B. Prahlad & Company, fruit and vegetable
merchants, Subzimandi, Delhi for compensalion in identical circumstances and the plea on behalf of
the Union as to the locus standi of the plaintiff was repelled for the reasons that prevailed in the
above suit. The judgment and decree of the trial Court is challenged by the Union in revision.
(4) S.A.O. 30/73 arises out of a suit filed by M/s. Lal Chand Madhev Das, fruit & vegetable
Merchants, Subzimandi, Delhi, a consignee. The plea of the Union that the plaintiff had no locus
standi to file the suit, being a bare consignee, prevailed with the trial court and the suit was
accordingly dismissed. Relying on the case of Ghamandi Lal (supra) and that of Morvi Mercantile
Bank Ltd., , the trial court held that an endorsee of a railway receipt for valuable consideration could
maintain a suit in his own name. The plea of the plaintiff was, however, turned down on the ground
that although the plaintiff produced "Some evidence of having advanced some money to the
consignor" but the evidence could not be looked into "in the absence of a plea" to the effect that the
plaintiff had property in the goods. The judgment and decree of the trial court was, however,
reversed in appeal and the suit was decreed and it was held, on the authority of the case of Jalan and
Sons (supra) and that of Ghamandi Lal (supra) and of Lakshmi Ratan Cotton Mills Ltd., , that the
plaintiff having "advanced the price of the consignment to the consignor" had the "right to institute
the suit in his own name". The case was accordingly remanded to the trial court for decision on
merits. The Union has brought up the matter on a Second Appeal.

(5) At the hearing of these matters, it was not disputed that the respondents were, during the
material time, commission agents. It was, however, not disputed on behalf of the respondents that,
although in the suit out of which S.A.O. 30/73 has arisen, some evidence was produced to show that
the plaintiff in that case had advanced certain amounts to the consignor, there was no averment in
any of the three plaints that the plaintiffs were commission agents or that they had advanced any
money to the consignors or that they were consinees for consideration or had any title to or property
in the goods, either as owners or otherwise. It was, therefore, understood that the plea of the
respondents, as to their locus standi to maintain the suits, would have to be decided in the context of
the contention that a bare consignee, to whom the goods are consigned for the purpose of sale on
commission, was entitled to maintain a suit.
(6) The only question that, therefore, requires consideration is whether a person to whom goods are
consigned by the owner for the purpose of sale on commission can be said to have sufficient
property or interest in the goods so as to entitle him to maintain a suit against the Railways for
compensation on account of loss or damage to the goods, while in transit.
(7) Shri R. H. Dhebar, who addressed the main arguments on behalf of the Union, contended that
with the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of West Punjab Factories, 1966 Supreme Court
395,(5) the law with regard to the right to sue a carrier of goods for compensation could be said- to
have been crystallised and that ordinarily the consignor could sue the Railways, unless he was not
the owner and was acting as an agent of the owner, in which case the owner of the goodscould
maintain such an action. He further contended that the right to sue arises cither out of the contract
of carriage or is founded in the title to the goods and that it was either a person who was a party to
such a contract or the owner of the goods who could maintain such an action. He urged that the
respondents in the present case, even though commission agents, had no locus standi to file the
suits because they were neither the owners of the goods nor parties to the contracts of carriage and
the only inierest they could be said to have in the goods was a prospect to earn a commission on sale
thereof on behalf of the consignor, which alone could not entitle them to sue.
(8) Shri Madan Bhatia, who led the defense on behalf of the commission agents, traced the entire
history of the judicial controversy on the question, sought to widen the scope of the right to
maintain an action, and urged that the railway receipt was not only a document of title but had been
judicially assimilated to a bill of lading "for all purposes" and the consignee named in the railway
receipt, where he was different from the consignor, would be she repository of not only the title to
the goods to which the receipt relates but also of all the benefits of the contract of carriage
represented by it and was, therefore, entitled to maintain an action for compensation against the
Railways merely by virtue of being such a consignee. He further contended that the fact that the
respondents were admittedly commission agents, reinforces their case to maintain an action
because of a well-known custom in the trade and, therefore, on the principle of law merchant which
treat the railway receipt as being symbclic of the goods. He, therefore, urged that in any event a
commission agent had sufficient interest in the goods which would entitle him to sue and that to
hold to the contrary, in the words of Suhba Rao J. in Morvi Mercantile Bank (supra), "would be a
retrograde step and would paralyse the entire mechanism of finance of our internal
trade............where goods are carried by railway over long distances and remain in transit for long
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130044/ 2Union Of India vs Jashan Mal & Co. on 8 April, 1976
periods of time, the railway receipt is regarded as a symbol of the goods for all purposes." He relied
on a number of decisions of the various High Courts which concede to the consignee and an
endorsee the right to maintain such an action. He also sought to spell the right of a consignee, who
was a commission agent, to sue, from his status as a bailee of the goods for the consignor and
contended that a consignment to a commission agent for sale squarely fell within the meaning of the
term "bailment" for it was none other than a delivery of goods for a specific purpose, namely, sale on
behalf of the consigno. According to his contention, the ratio of some of the earlier decisions which
had found a right in a consignee or an endorsee to maintain an action because the railway receipt
had been assimilated to a bill of lading for all purposes had since been sanctified by the observations
of Subba Rao J. extracted above and the legal position that thus emerged had not in any way been
whittled down by the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of West Punjab Factories (supra).
(9) Now a railway receipt is basically a simple document. in the first instance, it contains an
acknowledgement by the carrier of the receipt by it of goods for 'he purpose of carriage to a specified
destination. In the second instance, it incorporates a contract of carriage whereby the carrier accepts
the obligation to carry the goods to a specified destination and to deliver it to a named consignee or
his agent i.e. the endorsee. It carries a legal obligation for the carrier to take as much care of the
goods in transit as a prudent person would of his own. The right to sue the carrier for damages on
account of loss of or damage to the goods, while in transit, has, however, been subject matter of
fierce judicial controversy and the examination of the question by the various courts has produced a
sharp conflict of judicial opinion not only between the various courts but even within certain High
Courts and have over the years led to an unfortunate uncertainty into the law relating to the right to
sue the Railways on the basis of a railway receipt. The only relieving feature has been that the
controversy has produced some brilllent judgments by eminent judges, and I say so with respect.
(10) Generally speaking, the right to sue a carrier may have its genesis either in the relationship
between the plaintiff and the contract of carriage or in the relationship between the plaintiff and the
goods, forming subject matter of the contract. Under the ordinary law of contract it is only the
contracting party who would be competent to sue on a contract on an application of doctrine to
privity of contract. What is true of an ordinary contract is equally true in respect of a contract of
carriage. There may, however, be exceptions where, for example, the party entering into the contract
of carriage is not the principal but acting for another. In such a case the principal would be deemed
to be the party to the contract and be entitled to sue. There may be yet another exception where on
the dale the party enters into the contract of carriage, property in the goods has already passed in
course of a sale. In such a case also, the party that enters into the contract would be deemed to be
the agent of the true owner. Another instance may be where the goods are consigned by the owner
under some arrangement, other than sale, which envisages that they would be in transit at the risk
of the consignee. In such a case also, the consignee would be deemed to be the party to the contract
and would be entitled to sue. Similarly, the right to sue may arise out of the plaintiff's relationship
with the goods. Ordinarily, the owner of the goods would be entitled to sue for any injury to the
goods independently of the contract of carriage. Such a right may also arise where the plaintiff has
other actionable right in the goods short of being its full owner. Such cases would arise where the
plaintiff has some special property in the goods. In such cases also, the plaintiff would be entitled to
sue by virtue of having an actionable right or property in the goods. Such cases may arise where the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130044/ 3Union Of India vs Jashan Mal & Co. on 8 April, 1976
party seeking to sue is, for exemple, a pledgee of the goods. If one were to apply the two-fold test as
to the relationship between the plaintiff and the contract of carriage and as to the relationship
between the plaintiff and the goods, forming subject matter of the contract, there would perhaps
have been very little difficulty. What has really created complication is that in the course of ordinary
mercantile practice a railway receipt has been treated as a document of title and considered as
representing the goods and in dealing with such a document the mercantile community has more or
less assimilated it to a bill of lading, which by virtue of the provisions of law merchant and the
statutory provisions, both in England and in India, has assumed an unusual status as a document of
title so that any endorsement of a bill of lading or mention in it of the name of a person as a
consignee has the effect of not only transferring the property in the goods to the endorsee or the
consignee but also amounts to an assignment of ail the rights of the endorser or the consignor in the
contract which the bill of lading incorporates. What further complicates the situation is that certain
provisions of the Sale of Goods Act, [S. 2(4)] and the Transfer of Property Act, (S. 137) have
assimilated a railway receipt to a bill of lading for certain purposes and it has been described in
statutory provisions as being a document of title with the result that considerable controversy has
centered round the question if the mention of a person as a consignee in a railway receipt or an
endorsement on a railway receipt by the consignor or the consignee, for consideration or otherwise,
had the effect of either transferring the property in the goods in favor of the consignee or endorsee
or assigning the benefit of the contract of carriage in favor of the assignee or the consignee. Courts
have taken conflicting views as to the legal effect of mentioning a person as a consignee and as to the
endorsement of a railway receipt by the consignor or the consignee on the right of such a consignee
or endorsee to maintain an action against the carrier.
(11) If Bofore examing, the validity of the various contentions, It would be useful to review the
leading English and Indian deaistions touching the question as to the right to sue the carrier.
(12) In England the controversy as to who may sue for loss of or injury to goods while in transit was
started as far back as the year 1770 and the earliest case on the point is Eves v. James, (1770) 5 Burr
2680. By 1859 the legal position had more or less been crystallized with the decision in the famous
case of Dunlop v. Lambert, (1839) 6CI and Fin 600. Halsbury in Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th
edition, has digested all these cases and some of the later decisions and summarised the legal
position in his inimitable pithy style in paras 452, 453 and 454 :
''452.Where goods have been delivered to a carrier, and they are lost or injured, the
owner of the goods is the proper person to sue for damages. A consignor who
consigns only as agent, and has no property in the goods, has no right of action unless
it is given to him by the terms of the contract. Nevertheless where the goods are at the
consignor's risk until delivery to the consignee, the consignor may have a special
property in the goods, as bailee, sufficient to entitle him to sue. When, in pursuance
of a contract of sale, the seller is authorised or required to send the goods to the
buyer, delivery of the goods to a carrier, whether named by the buyer or not, to be
carried to the buyer, is prima facie delivery of the goods to the buyer; and where the
seller thus delivers the goods to the carrier he is deemed to have unconditionally
appropriated the goods to the contract unless he reserves the right of disposal.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130044/ 4Union Of India vs Jashan Mal & Co. on 8 April, 1976
Hence, as a general rule delivery of goods by a seller to a carrier for conveyance to the
buyer places the goods at the consignee's risk and therefore the consignee is the
proper person to sue in the event of loss or damage. Whenever goods are sent by a
seller to a buyer by a carrier, to whom the consignee's name is made known, the
ordinary inference is that the contract of carriage is between the carrier and the
consignee, and that the consignor is merely the agent of the consignee to make the
contract." * * * *"
"453.Delivery to a carrier, does not necessarily vest the property in the goods in the
consignee; and so, if the property in the goods has never passed to the consignee, the
consignor should sue for any loss or damage. Where goods are sent to the consignee
on approval, the consignor alone has a right to sue if the goods are lost or damaged in
transit." * * * * * "454.The general principle that the owner is the proper person to
sue may be varied by special agreement between the parties. Thus by agreement
between the consignor and the consignee the risk of the foods may remain with the
consignor until delivery, and, by agreement between the consignor and the carrier,
the carrier may be liable to the consignor. Further, if the consignor has made a
special contract with the carrier for the carriage of goods or if the consignor has
delivered them to the carrier as agent for the consignee, the consignee in the person
to sue, even though the property in the goods has not passed to him, and this may be
the case even though the consignor has paid the carrier, for, in the absence of any
arrangement to the contrary, the consignor is always liable ro pay the carrier."
(13) The course of judicial determination of the right to sue a carrier has not been so smooth in
India.
(14) In the case of Amar Chand & Co., Air 1914 Bombay 290, (8) a division bench of the Bombay
High Court was called upon to consider the question whether a railway receipt, being assignable by
endorsement under the conditions printed on the back thereof, was an instrument of title to the
goods u/s 103 of the Contract Act. The railway receipt in that case was a document under which the
goods were received for a mixed transit by land and sea. It was pointed out that u/s 103 of the
Contract Act it was not only a bill of lading but any other instrument of title to goods which may be
assigned with the same effect as results from the assignment of a bill of lading. It was, therefore,
held that "on the special facts of these cases the railway receipt, if assignable by endorsement, would
be an instrument of title to the goods u/s 103 of Contract Act". This decision was followed by
another decision of that court in the case of Dolatram Dwarkadas, Air 1914 Bombay 178, (9) and it
was held in a very brief judgment that "it must be taken as settled law that a railway receipt is a
mercantile document of title. That being so we think it necessarily follows that the endorsee of such
a railway receipt has sufficient interest in the goods covered by it to maintain an action of this kind."
There is no further discussion in this judgment. In the case of Ramdas Vithaldas Durbar, Air 1916
Privy Council 7, (10) which arose out of the decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of Amar
Chand & Co. (supra) the Judicial Committee had to consider if a railway receipt was an instrument
of title within the meaning of section 103 of Contract Act. On a consideration of the various
provisions of the law of contract and of the English Factors Act, 1842, Lord Parker, who delivered
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130044/ 5Union Of India vs Jashan Mal & Co. on 8 April, 1976
the judgment of the Board, held that:
"WHENEVERany doubt arises as to whether a particular document is a 'document
showing title' or a 'document of title' to goods for the purposes of the Indian Contract
Act, the test is whether the document in question is used in the ordinary course of
business as proof of the possession or control of the goods or authorising or
purporting to authorise, either by endorsement or delivery, the possessor of the
document to transfer or receive the goods thereby represented."
It was further pointed out that the word "title" in both the expressions, namely, instrument of title
or document of title, can relate only the right to receive the delivery of the goods to which the
instrument or document relates and that "it can have nothing to do with ownership". The learned
Judge further observed that "the only point in which a bill of lading differs from the other
documents of title is that its assignment, whether upon a resale or by way of pledge, operates as a
constructive delivery of the goods to which it refers and that there is no other document of title with
this peculiarity. " In Mercantile Bank of India Ltd., the question before the Judicial Committee was
whether the pledge of a railway receipt was tantamount to a pledge of the goods represented by it or
was merely a pledge of the document. On an examination of the provisions of Sections 102, 103, 172
and 178 of the Contract Act and following the decision in the earlier case of Ramdas Vithaldas
(supra) it was held that a railawy receipt was a document of title within Section 178 of the Contract
Act; that the Section, as it stood then, entitled the owner as well as the mercantile agent to make a
pledge; and pledge of the document amounts to a pledge of the goods. In Shamji Bhanji Bhagwati J.,
as he then was, held that even though a railway receipt was a document of title to goods, a mere
endorsement of it was not by itself enough to transfer the property in the goods and that a bare
endorsement merely constituted the endorsee an agent of the consignee for the purpose of taking
delivery; that the endorsement created rights, if any, between the endorser and the endorsee inter se
but none between the endorsee and the carrier as the property in the goods were never transferred
to the endorsee, the consignor who entered into the contract of carriage alone was competent to sue;
that the consignee would have been entitled to sue if the property in the goods had passed to the
consignee when the contract of carriage was entered into; that a person not a party to the contract
could not sue on the contract unless the case was covered within the recognised exceptions to the
principle of privity of contract. It was further pointed out that the railway receipt and other
documents enumerated in Section 2(4) of the Sale of Goods Act had been assimilated to a bill of
lacking for purposes of stoppage in transit under Section 103 of the Contract Act and a pledge under
Section 178 of the Contract Act and not for all purposes. This is how the learned Judge put his
conclusion :
"IT is only by reason of the enactment of the Bills of Lading Act, 1855 (18 & 19 Vie. c.
111) that the issue or transfer of a bill of jading operates as a delivery to the buyer of
the goods shipped, and the consignee of the bill of lading is entitled to sue upon the
contract contained in the same. [See also Bills of Lading Act 9 (IX) of 1856 in India].
Even though as observed by their Lordships of the Privy Council in 18 Born. L. R. 670
(12) and 37 Born. L.R. 130 (13) the railway receipt and all other documents
enumerated in S. 2, sub-s. (4), Sale of Goods Act, arc assimilated to bills of lading for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130044/ 6Union Of India vs Jashan Mal & Co. on 8 April, 1976
the purposes of the right of stoppage in transit under S. 103, Contract Act and a
pledge under S. 178. Contract Act, the effect of those decisions is not to assimilate the
railway receipt to a bill of lading for all purposes whatsoever. The position of these
documents is the same as it was at common law and that position is not affected at all
by the enactment of S. 2, sub-s. (4). Sale of Goods Act, or the enactment of provisions
analogous to Ss. 103 and 178, Contract Act therein."
In Jalan and Sons Ltd. (supra) a Division Bench of the Punjab High Court held that since a railway
receipt was a mercantile document of title, the endorsement of it vested the endorsee with a valuable
right and that such an endorsee was not only competent to take delivery but also give a complete
discharge and that. it followed, therefore that he was competent to bring a suit against the Railways
for damages. In the case of Gaya Pershad Gopal Narain, , a Full Bench took the view, relying on the
case of Air 1914 Bombay 178; Air 1924 Allahabad 574 and Air 1949 East Punjab 190, and overruling
an earlier decision of that Court in 1954 Allahabad 747, that a consignee, who was not the owner of
the goods, but to whom the goods were consigned for the purpose of sale on commission basis, was
entitled to maintain a suit for loss in respect of demage caused to the goods while in transit. Kidwai
J. who spoke for the Court expressed the view that the raiiway would be primarily liable to the
consignor, who alone was party to I he contract, and that the owner of the goods "as such does not
come to the picture at all": that according to Indian law noi only the parties to the contract but even
"persons who arc entitled to a benefit under it or to whom the right had been conferred by transfer
can also sue. It appears from the judgment that on behalf of she Railways it was conceded that in
case of non-delivery it was the consignee or the person in whose favor the railway receipt had been
endorsed, who could sue. This judgment has, however, been subject matter of considerable criticism
in the later decisions of some of the High Courts. An interesting feature of this ease is that the
decision primarily turned on the admission by the counsel for the Railways on the question as to the
right of a consignee to sue and although a number of judgments arc referred to, it is not possible to
spell out of it the principles on which the decision as based. The case of Shah Mulji Deoji, Air 1957
Nagpur 31 (15) is a decision of considerable importance. In that case, the goods were consigned to
self and the consignor had endorsed the railway receipt, which was followed by successive
endorsements. The plaintifi was the last endorsee. The suit was resisted on the ground that the
plaintiff had no locus standi to sue. Following two questions were referred to the Division Bench by
a learned Single Judge :
"(1)When goods are consigned to self under a railway receipt and the receipt is
endorsed in favor of another can the endorsee, merely by reason of the endorsement
in his favor, institute a suit against the railway administration for damages either for
non-delivery or short delivery of the goods covered by the railway receipt ?
(2)Where there are a series of endorsements on the railway receipt, can the last
endorsee institute a suit in his own name on mere proof of the fact that he paid
consideration to the prior endorsee or is it necessary for the former to establish that
the title to the goods represented by the railway receipt passed from the original
consignee through the intermediate endorsees to him?"
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130044/ 7Union Of India vs Jashan Mal & Co. on 8 April, 1976
Kaushalendra Rao & Hidayatullah Jj, who constituted the Division Bench, differed with the result
that the matter was referred to a third learned Judge. On a review of the decided cases. Rao J,
proposed the answer to the first question in the negative and felt that in that view the second
question did not survive. It was held that if the endorsee was to be regarded as an assignee of the
contract then he would, in the absence of usage, be subject to the rule that the assignee must prove
his title to sue through all the intermediate assignees, if any. The learned Judge reviewed the leading
decisions and pointed out that the source of authority of the decisions which had answered the first
question in the affirmative could be traced back to the decision of the Bombay High Court in the
case of Amarchand & Co. (supra), which was not concerned with the right of an endorsee of a
railway receipt to maintain an action against the Railways and that the point that arose for
consideration in that case was about the right of stoppage in transit by an unpaid vendor. The
learned Judge then pointed out that the railway receipt had more than one aspect to it, in that
primarily it was a receipt for the goods accepted for carriage. Secondly, it was a document of title in
terms of Section 2(4) of the Sale of Goods Act and lastly it was evidence of the contract of carriage
and cautioned that unless these aspects are clearly kept distinct confusion was bound to result. The
learned Judge expressed the view that where an action was founded on contract of carriage, the
proper question to ask was with whom was the contract entered into and if the consignor consigns
the goods to self he retained the property in the goods and he was the person who was party to the
contract, and, therefore, a proper person to sue in the absence of a special contract to the contrary.
It was, therefore, held that a mere endorsement can be considered as constituting the endorsee an
agent of the consignee for the purpose of taking delivery. The learned Judge distinguished the bill of
lading by virtue of the provisions of the Bill of Lading Act from documents of title other than a bill of
lading and held, following Air 1916 P.C. 7 (supra) and that the railway receipt and other documents
of title mentioned in Section 2(4) of the Sale of Goods Act are assimilated to a bill of lading for the
specified purposes of right of stoppage in transit under Section 103 of the Contract Act and a pledge
under Section 178 of the Contract Act. The learned Judge, therefore, expressed his approval of the
decision of Bhagwati J. in 1947 Bombay 169, and held that an endorsement by itself was not enough
to constitute an endorsee either as a bona fide pledgee for value or a bona fide transferee for value of
the goods represented by the railway receipt and that without anything more it only constituted the
endorsee an agent of the consignee for the purpose of taking delivery and that the endorsement by
itself did not create any rights between the endorsee and the railway company. The ultimate
conclusion of the learned Judge is set out in para 46 of the judgment which is in the following terms
:
"THOUGHthe cases have accumulated in favor of an affirmative answer to the first
question, I am constrained to say with the utmost respect, the propositions on which
they rest cannot bear scrutiny. The fact that the railway receipt is a document of title
or that the endorsee who has become the owner of the goods covered by it has a
sufficient interest in the goods does not by itself establish that he can sue on the
contract of carriage to which he was not a party. It is one thing to say that because a
railway receipt is a document of title to the goods it may be dealt with as the goods
themselves and quite a different thing to lay down that any one in possession of the
document as an endorsee authorised to take delivery can sue the carrier when the
goods agreed to be carried under the receipt arc not forthcoming at the destination."

Hidayatullah C.J., as he then was, however, took a contrary view and proposed an affirmative
answer to the first question and held on the second question that the last endorsee was entitled to
sue in his own name without proving that he was a holder for value. Tambe J. to whom the matter
was referred for decision concurred with Hidayatullah C.J. and according to the majority view an
unqualified endorsement on a railway receipt has the effect of not only transferring to the endorsee
property in the goods covered by the railway receipt but also of transferring to him the right and
benefit of the contract of carriage with the result that such an endorsee would have a right to
maintain an action to enforce its performance in his own name and to sue for damages on account of
failure to perform it. It was further held that the title to the railway receipt passes to the endorsee by
virtue of the endorsement and the endorsee has a right of action and that a railway receipt was in
effect clothed with all the essential characteristics of negotiability though it may not be a negotiable
instrument in a strictest sense and that assuming that it did not have the characeristic of
negotiability, the matter has become so settled that it is unnecessary to prove that they are treated as
negotiable by the custom in the trade. It was accordingly held that where there were series of
endorsements on a railway receipt, the last endorsee had a right to institute a suit in his own name
without proving that he was a holder for value since that would be presumed unless rebutted. In the
final analysis, this judgment raised the railway receipt to the position that a bill of lading occupies
both in England and in India after the statutory provisions which have clothed them with a peculiar
status in law. In General Trading Corporation Ltd., a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court was,
inter alia, concerned with the question whether the plaintiffs, who were consignees in respect of
some of the consignments and endorsees from the consignee in respect of the others, were entitled
to maintain the actions against the carrier. It was a common case of the parties that the plaintiffs
were not the owners in all the consignments. In respect of some of the consignments in which the
plaintiffs were mentioned as consignees, they were acting as shipping agents for the ultimate foreign
buyers of the goods. In respect of the other consignments, the consignors, who were also consignees,
had forwarded the railway receipt to the plaintiffs in order that the plaintiffs, as their agents, could
clear the goods from the Railways and ship them to certain foreign destinations. The plaintiffs had
not paid any money in respect of any of the goods before the loss. Two questions were, therefore,
mooted before the Division Bench, namely, (a) is the consignee named in a railway receipt entitled
to sue the railway for non-delivery of the goods ? and (b) is a buyer endorsee of railway receipt
entitled to sue the railway ? Mukherjee J. in a very elaborately drawn opinion, answered both the
questions in the negative. Bachawat J. by a separate opinion, concurred. Mukherjee J. reviewed
practically all the English and Indian decisions, examined the question on principle and held that
even though the effect of the decision of the Privy Council in Air 1967 P.C. 7 and was that the railway
receipt and other documents mentioned in Section 2(4) of the Sale of Goods Act are assimilated to
the bill of lading for the purpose of Section 103 and 178 of the Contract Act, these documents could
not be treated on the same footing as bills of lading "for all purposes" and that this limitation was
inherent in the decisions of the Privy Council themselves. It was further pointed out that it would
not be correct to ascribe to a railway receipt the various properties and attributes which belong only
to a bill of lading by virtue of its peculiar position in the law merchant and also by reason of the
statutory provisions, both in England and in India, on the subject. It was further pointed out that
from the point of view of negotiability, a railway receipt was more or less comparable to a bill of
lading as it was at common law before the passing of the Bills of Lading Act, 1855 in England and
the enactment of the Bills of Lading Act. 1856 in India and that the properties and incidents of a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130044/ 9Union Of India vs Jashan Mal & Co. on 8 April, 1976
railway receipt and the effect of endorsement and delivery of it in India would be pari materia with
the properties and incidents of a bill of lading before the statutory protection given to it. The learned
Judge, therefore, came to the conclusion that an endorsee of a railway receipt could not sue the
railways on the contract evidenced by the railway receipt merely because the property or the interest
in the goods has been transferred to him, and that such a person could sue only for conversion or
negligence and that without such property or interest, he has only the right to receive the delivery of
the goods and would be in the same position as a bare consignee who has no right or property in the
goods. The learned Judge characterised sonic of the decisions as having taken wrong view of the law
and dissented from the view expressed in . The learned Judge subjected to severe criticism the
decision of the Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court in . Bachwat J, while concurring with the
opinion of Mukherjee J, added an interesting postscript expressing a virtual wish that the law was
otherwise than the learned Judge found it to be so. This is contained in para 120 of the judgment
which could be appropriately reproduced:
"Iwas inclined to hold, if I could, that every consignee named in the railway receipt as
also every endorsee of it by the named consignee arc entitled to sue the railway
administration concerned for loss or injury to the goods. The existing commercial
practice favors such a right of suit and I was inclined to uphold the practice, if I could.
But on the authorities, and on principle, I am compelled to hold otherwise. I regret
this conclusion, because it will encourage technical defense by the railway
administrations. In the interest of commerce, the Legislature should intervene and
sanction the existing commercial practice."
In Ibrahim Isabhai, a Division Bench of that Court held that the railway receipt was a document of
title in the limited sense of a right to receive or take delivery of the goods', that an endorsement and
delivery of a railway receipt does not by itself pass title to the goods', that an endorsee was not
entitled to sue the railway by reason of an endorsement: that an endorsement did not affect the
property in the goods; that the right of a consignor under the railway receipt was not an actionable
claim and was, therefore, not transferable; that the benefit of a contract was assignable but the
assignee did not get the right to sue which vested in a party which was privity to the contract; that
the Railway Administration could not enter into a contract for the benefit of a third person and the
mere fact that the consignee was a "pucca Adatia" did not entitle him to institute a suit for damages
unless he shows that the goods represented by the railway receipt had been transferred to him as
owner or any interest therein had been created in his favor.
(15) In the ease of Norvi Mercantile Bank Ltd., (supra) the Supreme Court had an opportunity to
resolve the conflict and to introduce an element of certainty into tins branch of law when it was
called upon to consider two questions, namely, if a valid pledge had been created in favor of the
bank, inter alia, by the endorsement of the railway receipt in its favor and by the delivery of it to the
bank, and, if not, whether the bank could maintain an action for compensation on account of loss of
or damage to the goods by virtue of being an endorsee for consideration. Unfortunately, as it now
appears, the Bench hearing the matter was divided on the first question. While Subba Rao J. as he
then was and who spoke for himself and for Raghubar Dayal and Bachawat JJ. held that a valid
pledge had been made in favor of the Bank on the ground that the owner of goods could make a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130044/ 10Union Of India vs Jashan Mal & Co. on 8 April, 1976
valid pledge of them by transferring the railway receipt representing the said goods, Ramaswami J.
as he then was, and who speaking for himself and for Mudholkar J. expressed the dissenting
opinion, answered the question in the negative on the ground that by virtue of the provisions of new
Section 178 of the Contract Act, a mercantile agent alone was competent to make a valid pledge of
the goods without the possession of the goods. The majority opinion noticed that the second
question was a larger question "on which there is a conflict of opinion" but in the view that they took
of the first question, they did not feel any obligation to deal with the larger question. Subba Rao J.,
however, expressed his satisfaction for having arrived at a happy conclusion and made certain
observations which may be said to give some sanctity to the reasoning on which the line of decisions
which have construed the railway receipt rather liberally could be said to be based. It is these
observations which, to my mind. have inspired the wide contention urged before me on behalf of the
commission agents. This is what Subba Rao J. said :
"WEare glad that, on a reasonable construction of the material provisions of the
relevant Acts, we have been able to reach this conclusion. To accept the contentions
of the respondents to the contrary would be a retrograde step and would paralyse the
entire mechanism of finance of our internal trade. In this vast country where goods
are carried by railway over long distances and remain in transit for long periods of
time, the railway receipt is regarded as a symbol of the goods for all purposes for
which a bill of lading is so regarded in England."
Ramaswami J., however, went into the larger question, since he had answered the first question in
the negative. The learned Judge dispelled the contention that the bank was entitled to sue by virtue
of being an endorsee of the railway receipt. The learned Judge pointed out that as in law a bill of
lading was not negotiable like a bill of exchange so as to enable the endorsee to maintain an action
in his own name, the effect of the endorsement being only to transfer the property in the goods but
not the contract itself and that the documents like the railway receipt were in the same position as
the bill of lading was before the Bills of Lading Act 1856 and that it was only by reason of the
enactment of the said statute that the issue or transfer of a bill of lading operated as a delivery to the
buyer of the goods shipped and the consignee of the bill of lading was entitled to sue upon the
contract contained in the same, a position that obtains in India vis-a-vis the bill of lading after the
Act of 1856. The learned Judge further observed that even though the railway receipt and all other
documents enumerated in Section 2(4) of the Sale of Goods Act were assimilated to bill of lading for
the purposes of the right of stoppage in transit under section 103, Contract Act but it could not be
said that the railway receipt has been assimilated to a bill of lading "for all purposes whatsoever". It
was, therefore, observed that "the legal position of the railway receipt is the same as it was in
English Law and that position is not affected at all by the enactment of Section 2, sub-section (4) of
the Sale of Goods Act, or the enactment of provisions analogous to Ss. 103 and 178 of the Contract
Act". It was, therefore, held that there are no rights created by mere reason of endorsement of a
railway receipt between the endorsee and the railway company which had issued the receipt to the
consignee, the only remedy of the endorsee being against the endorser. It was further held that in
the absence of any usage of trade or any statutory provision to that effect a railway receipt cannot be
accorded the benefits which flow from negotiability under the Negotiable Instruments Act, so as to
entitle she endorsee as the holder for the time being of the document of title to sue the carrier the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130044/ 11Union Of India vs Jashan Mal & Co. on 8 April, 1976
railway authorities in his own name" and lhat "if the claim of the plaintiff is as an ordinary assignee
of the contract of carriage, then the plaintiff has to prove the assignment in his favor." The learned
Judge approved the decision of Bhagwati J., as he then was, in , as representing the true legal
position. The argument that to hold contrary to the contention of the bank would be a "retrograde
step" and would cause considerable hardship, which prevailed with Subba Rao J, and which were
the basis of expression of a satisfaction by him in the passage quoted above, did not appeal to the
learned Judge. This is how the contention was repelled :
"COUNSELfor appellant has referred to the practice of merchants in treating a
railway receipt as a symbol of goods and in making pledge of goods by pledge of
railway receipts, but no such practice or custom has been alleged or proved on behalf
of the plaintiff in 'the present case. In the absence of such allegation or proof it is not
open to the Court to take any judicial notice of any such practice. Counsel for
appellant also referred to possible inconvenience and hardship to merchants if such a
practice is not judicially recognised but. the argument from inconvenience and
hardship is a dangerous one and is only admissible in construction where the
meaning of the statute is obscure. In Sutlers v. Briggs, 1922-1 Ac 1 (19) at p. 8 Lord
Birkenhead stated :
"THEconsequences of this view of S. 2 of the Gaming Act, 1835 will no doubt be
extremely inconvenient to many person. But this is not a matter proper to influence
the House unless in a doubtful case affording foothold for balanced speculation as to
the probable intention of the legislature."
In the present case the language of S. 178 of the Contract Act is clear and explicit and if any hardship
and inconvenience is felt it is for Parliament to take appropriate steps to amend the law and not for
the courts to legislate under the guise of interpretation."
(16) In the case of Punjab Factories Ltd., 1966 Supreme Court 395, (Supra) the Supreme Court had
yet another opportunity to examine the larger question as to the right of a consignee to sue the
carrier. The appeals before the Supreme Court arose out of two suits. One suit was by the consignor,
the original owner of the goods, while the other was filed by the endorsee. The contentions of the
Union as to the right of the plaintiffs to maintain actions were dispelled and the suits were decreed.
The decrees were affirmed in appeal. One of the contentions raised before the Supreme Court was
that the suits were not maintainable. The contention in the first case on behalf of the Union was that
the consignee being different from the consignor, the original owner of the goods could not bring the
suit and the consignee alone could maintain it. It was held that ordinarily, it is the consignor who
could sue because he was party to the contract of carriage and that where the property in the goods
has passed from the consignor to someone else that other person may be able to sue. The contention
on behalf of the Union was that the railway receipt was a document of title to goods by virtue of
provisions or Section 2(4) of the Indian Sale of Goods Act and as such it was the consignee who had
the title to the goods where the consignor or the consignee were different, interestingly enough, a
contention which is being raised in the present case on behalf of the consignees, and has throughout
been emphatically resisted on behalf of the Union. It was held that even though a railway receipt was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130044/ 12Union Of India vs Jashan Mal & Co. on 8 April, 1976
a document of title to goods covered by it, it did not follow that where the consignor and consignee
arc different, the consignee is "necessarily the owner of goods and the consignor in such
circumstances can never be the owner of the goods" and that the mere fact that the consignee is
different from the consignor "does not necessarily pass title to the goods from the consignor to the
consignee, and the question whether title to goods has passed to the consignee will have to be
decided on other evidence." It was pointed out that it was quite possible for the consignor to relain
title in the goods himself while the consignment is booked in the name of another person. The right
to sue appears to have been made dependant on the title to the goods and the test enunciated was in
whom the title to the goods vested during transit. It was found that in terms of the contract between
the parties the goods would be dispatched by Railways at the seller's risk. until the destination of the
goods at the godowns of the consignee and the property in the goods had not, therefore, passed to
the consignee until the goods had reached the destination. The suit of the consignor was, therefore.
hold to be maintainable because the consignor retained the title to the goods when the loss occurred.
The conclusion of the Court in respect of the first of the two suits is set out in para 10 of the
judgment which is reproduced below :
"THEcontention of the appellant with respect to five of the consignments in the suit
of the factory was that as the consignee of the five railway receipts was the J. C. Mills,
the consignor (namely, the factory) could not bring the suit with respect thereto and
only the J. C. Mills could maintain the suit. Ordinarily, it is the consignor who can
sue if there is damage to the consignment, for the contract of carriage is between the
consignor and the railway administration. Where the property in the goods carried
has passed from the consignor to some-one-else, that other person may be able to
sue. Whether in such a case the consignor can also sue docs not arise on the facts in
the present case and as to that we say nothing. The argument on behalf of the
appellant is that the railway receipt is a document of title to goods [sec S. 2(4) of the
Indian Sale of Goods Act, No. 3 of 1930], and as such it is the consignee who has title
to the goods where the consignor and consignee arc different, it is true that a railway
receipt is a document of title to goods covered by it, but from that alone it does not
follow, where the consignor and consignee arc different, that the consignee is
necessarily the owner of goods and the consignor in such circumstances can never be
the owner of the goods. The mere fact that the consignee is different from the
consignor does not necessarily pass title to the goods from the consignor to the
consignee, and the question whether title to goods has passed to the consignee will
have to be decided on other evidence. It is quite possible for the consignor to retain
title in the goods himself while the consignment is booked in the name of another
person. Take a simple case where a consignment is booked by the owner and the
consignee is the owner's servant, the intention being that the servant will take
delivery at the place of destination. In such a case the title to the goods would not
pass from the owner to the consignee and would still remain with the owner, the
consignee being merely a servant or agent of the owner of consignor for purposes of
taking delivery at the place of destination. It cannot therefore, be accepted simply
bacause a consignee in a railway receipt is different from a consignor that the
consignee must be held to be the owner of the goods and he alone can sue and not the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130044/ 13Union Of India vs Jashan Mal & Co. on 8 April, 1976
consignor. As we have said already, ordinarily, the consignor is the person,. who has
contracted with the railway for the carriage of goods and he can sue; and it is only
where title to the goods has passed that the consignee may be able to sue. Whether
title to goods has passed from the consignor to the consignee will depend upon the
facts of each case and so we have to look at the evidence produced in this case to
decide whether in the case of five consignments booked to the J. C. Mills, the title to
the goods had passed to the Mills before the fire broke out on March 8, 1943. We may
add that both the courts have found that title to the goods had not passed to the J. C.
Mills by that date and that it was still in the consignor and therefore the Factory was
entitled to sue. We may in this connection refer briefly to the evidence on this point."
In the second of the two suits, the plaintiff claimed the right to sue the Railways on the ground that
he was the owner of the goods and relied on the endorsement in his favor by the consignor even
though it was consigned to self in support of his title to the goods. It was also contended that in any
event the plaintiff was entitled to maintain the suit as a bare endorsee to a document of title. The
trial Court found that the plaintiff was not only the owner of the goods and was, therefore, entitled
to sue but that he was also entitled to sue by virtue of being the endorsee of a document of title. The
High Court confirmed the finding and held that the plaintiff was not only the owner of the goods but
was the "endorsed consignee" and in that capacity had the necessary locus standi to sue. The High
Court also observed that the correctness of this proposition was not challenged before it. It was in
these circumstances that the Supreme Court held that in view of the concurrent finding of the two
Courts below that the "plaintiff was the owner of the goods and that was why the railway receipt was
endorsed in his favor" "he is certainly entitled to maintain the suit". An interesting feature of this
decision. is that the judgment makes no reference to the almost perennial controversy raised in
Courts in India with regard to the right of a consignee or an endorsee to file a suit nor is there any
reference to the earlier decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Morvi Mercantile Bank (supra).
Interestingly enough, even the majority judgment in the earlier case merely noticed the larger
controversy and, therefore, felt relieved of the duty to deal with the various decisions and left it to
the minority to deal with the question in view of the way the minority looked at the first question.
Unfortunately, however, and I say so with respect, the minority opinion also did not consider the
various decisions touching the question so as to stabilise the legal position, to the extent it was
possible for a minority opinion to do so.
(17) Shri Bhatia, learned counsel for the respondents/plaintiffs, urged that the decisions of the
various High Courts which had found that a bare consignee and an endorsee would be competent to
sue by virtue of only being a consignee and endorsee, being based on the principle that the railway
receipt was a document of title and was to be assimilated to a bill of lading for all purposes, are
clearly sanctified by the observation of Subba Rao J. in the case of Morvi Mercantile Bank (supra)
and as a result of this decision the railway receipt has been sublimated to the position of a bill of
lading without the statutory prop like the Bill of Lading Act, which conferred that higher status on
the bill of lading both in England and in India. He contended that the observations of Subba Rao J.
clearly raised the railway receipt to that position and with that judgment holding the field, it was no
more possible to disputes the proposition that a mere consignee or an endorsee of a railway receipt
is not only the repository of title to the goods but is the assignee of the contract of carriage as well
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130044/ 14Union Of India vs Jashan Mal & Co. on 8 April, 1976
and has, therefore, the necessary locus standi to sue the railways in his own name. He claimed that
in the case of West Punjab Factories (supra) the Supreme Court was called upon to consider a
limited facet of the problem of the right to sue and that there was nothing in the conclusion of the
Supreme Court in that case which could be said to have, in any manner, whittled down the effect of
the observations of Subba Rao J. in raising the status of a railway receipt and in lending to it the
unusual negotiability, a conclusion on which the learned Judge felt so elated. Shri Dhebar, who
appeared for the Union, however, vehemently challenged this contention and urged that the
observations of Subba Rao J. have no such effect and that the observations must be seen in the
context in which they were made and be confined to that. He further urged that with the decision in
the case of West Punjab Factories (supra) the law relating to the right to sue the railways has more
or less become crystallised and that the effect of the judgment was that the right to sue must have
relation either to the contract of carriage or to the title to the goods and where the consignee or
endorsee claims such a right, he must establish either that he was a party to the contract or was an
assignee of the rights of the parties to the contract or had title to the goods and that a person who
did not have either was not competent to sue.
(18) Is there any conflict between the two decisions of the Supreme Court ? If so, which one would
prevail ? If not, what exactly is the law with regard to the right to sue the Railways and what are the
circumstances in which a consignee or an endors (19) On a review of the course of judicial decisions
from 1914 Bombay 290 to 1966 Supreme Court 395 spanning a period of over half a century, it
appears that the law with regard to the right to sue the carrier could be said to have been fairly
crystallised and some of the propositions could be treated as well settled. There is thus no doubt that
a consignor would be entitled to sue both by virtue of being a party to the contract of carriage as
indeed, a repository of title to the goods forming subject matter of such a contract, unless of course
on the date the contract was entered into property in the goods had already passed to the buyer and
the goods were, therefore, handed to the carrier for delivery to the buyer in course of trade, in which
case the consignor would be merely deemed to be an agent of the real owner and the real owner
alone would be competent to sue. Another case in which the original consignor may not be able to
sue is where there is a contract to the contrary which provides that the goods in transit would be at
the risk of another, or where even though property in the goods had not transferred, there is a
special agreement with regard to the right to sue, or the benefit of the contract of carriage has been
assigned to another in accordance with law. It follows, a fortiori, that a consignee or an endorsee of a
railway receipt to whom the property in the goods is passed would also be competent to sue. The
judicial controversy, however, still continues and the legal position of a mere consignee or an
endorsee in that behalf is not free from doubt. If a bare consignee to whom the railway receipt has
been delivered or a person in whose favor the railway receipt has been endorsed, without anything
more by the consignor, in case the consignment was consigned to self, or by the consignee, in the
other case or by the previous endorsee from either of these would be entitled to maintain an action
against the carrier in his own right and in his own name is still far from clear A reference to the
decided cases would appear to indicate that a long line of cases in which such a proposition was
negatived were based on the logic that even though the railway receipt was a document of title
known as such to the mercantile community, has certain characteristics of negotiability, though not
strictly speaking a negotiable instrument, and had, therefore, been assimilated to a bill of lading for
the purpose of section 103 of the Contract Act and Section 178 of the Contract Act, and for such
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130044/ 15Union Of India vs Jashan Mal & Co. on 8 April, 1976
other purposes, it could not be so assimilated" "for all purposes" because the peculiar characteristic
claimed for bills of lading, both in England and in India, was not the result of any custom, usage in
the trade or Law Merchant alone but had its foundation in the Bills of Lading Act, both in England
and in India. It was pointed out in these decisions that there was no custom among the mercantile
community that a mere consignment of goods in a railway receipt or mere endorsement of a railway
receipt would transfer to the consignee or the endorsee anything more than a mere right to take
delivery of the goods and to give a discharge to the carrier, and did not have the effect either of
transferring property in the goods or of assignment of the contract of carriage itself. It was also
pointed out in these cases that with a view to facilitate merchantile dealings Bills of Lading Acts
were passed both in England and in India as a result of which every consignee of goods named in a
bill of lading and every endorsee of a bill of lading to whom property of the goods therein mentioned
passed, upon or by reason of such consignment or endorsement shall have transferred to and vested
in him all rights of suit, and be subject to the same liability in respect of such goods as if the contract
contained in the bill of lading had been made with himself. This is exactly what section 1 of the Bill
of Lading Act, 1856 provides in India and is in turn based on its counterpart in England. These
decisions, therefore, took the view that the railway receipt would be, at best, in the position in which
a bill of lading was in England and in India before these enactments were made part of the statute
book and that, even if the property in the goods may pass, there would be no assignment of the
contract of carriage. That the courts would have gladly likened a railway receipt to a bill of lading in
the peculiar position that the latter has come to acquire with the statutory projection given to it, if it
was possible, in the absence of a statutory prop similar to the aforesaid statutes, remains without
doubt obviously because such a course would facilitate the course of trade in India where goods have
to travel long distances on the railway to reach from the point of production to the points of
exchange and eventually to points of distribution and consumption. The wish expressed by
Bachawat J. in which I have extracted above, would, to my mind represent an expression of almost
universal judicial desire. What, however, prevented courts from doing this was what was considered
by them to be a legal impediment and full expression was given lo this by Ramaswami, J. in his
minority opinion in the case of Morvi Mercantile Bank (Supra) when it was pointed out that counsel
for the appellant had referred to possible inconvenience and hardship to merchants if such a
practice was not judicially recognised "but the argument of inconvenience and hardship is a
dangerous one and is only admissible in construction where the meaning of statute is obscure." It
was further pointed out that "if any hardship and inconvenience is felt, it is for Parliament to take
appropriate steps to amend the law and not for the courts to legislate under the guise of
interpretation."
(20) It, however, appears to me that however controversial the task of equating a railway receipt to a
bill of lading for all purposes may be, and I must confess that there is considerable force in the
contention that in the absence of a statutory provision on the lines of the Bills of Lading Act, such a
fetal assimilation is not possible, my task has been made easier by the rather emphatic observation
of Subba Rao J., and I say so with respect, in the case of Morvi Mercantile Bank (supra) while
holding that a valid pledge had been made by the endorsement of the railway receipt and the
delivery of it. Besides certain other things, with which I am not concerned, the learned Judge gave
expression to a feeling of elation almost in the same strain in which Bachawat J. had expressed a
wish to hold. These observations, to my mind, do not contain any words of limitation and are not an
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130044/ 16Union Of India vs Jashan Mal & Co. on 8 April, 1976
expression of a mere wish but a considered conclusion that the railway receipt was a symbol of the
goods and was to be assimilated to a bill of lading "for all purposes for which a bill of lading is so
regarded in England". It must, therefore, be considered settled, so far as this court is concerned, that
the consignment of goods to a person, who is mentioned in the railway receipt as a consignee or an
endorsement of a railway receipt in favor of another would have the effect of not only transferring
property in the goods but also the rights under the contract of carriage represented by it, unless
there is something in the language of the endorsement or in the manner in which a person is
mentioned as the consignee which may deviate from this presumption. The contention that the
observations of Subba Rao J. would appear to have lost much of their vitality with the later decision
in the case of west Punjab Factories (supra) does not appear to me to be sustainable. As has been
pointed out above, the appeal before the Supreme Court arose out of two suits. One suit was by the
consignor, the original owner of the goods, while the other was filed by the endorsee. The contention
of the Union as to the right of the plaintiffs to maintain the suits were dispelled and the suits were
decreed. The decrees were confirmed in appeal. The contention in the Supreme Court in the first
case was that the consignee being different from the consignor, the original owner of the goods, the
consignor could not bring the suit and the consignee alone could maintain it. It was held that
ordinarily it is the consignor who could sue because he was a party to the contract of carriage and
that where property in the goods was passed from the consignor to someone else that other person
may be able to sue. The contention of the Union was that a railway receipt was a document of title to
goods by virtue of the provisions of section 2(4) of the Indian Sale of Goods Act and as such it was
the consignee who had the title to the goods where the consignor and the consignee were different.
It was pointed out that even though a railway receipt was a document of title to the goods covered by
it, it did not follow that where the consignor and the consignee are different, the consignee is
necessarily the owner of goods and the consignor in such circumstances can never be the owner of
the goods and that the mere fact that the consignee is different from the consignor does not
necessarily pass title to the goods from the consignor to the consignee and the question where title
to goods was passed to the consignee will have to be decided on other evidence. It was also pointed
out that it was quite possible for the consignor to retain title in the goods himself while the
consignment is consigned in the name of the other person. The right to sue appears to have been
made dependent on she title to the goods and the ies£ enunciated was as to the person in whom the

the goods would be dispatched by railways at the seller's risk until the destination of the goods at the

maintainable because the consignor retained the title to the goods when the loss occurred. In the
second of the two suits the plaintiff claimed the right to sue the railway on the ground that he was
the owner of the goods and relied on the endorsement in his favor by the consignor even though it
was consigned to self. It was also contended that in any event the plaintiff was entitled to maintain
the suit as a bare endorsee to a document of title.The courts below had returned a concurrent
finding that the plaintiff was not only the owner of the goods but was the "endorsed consignee" and
had the necessary locus standi to sue. It was in these circumstances that the Supreme Court held
that in view of the concurrent finding of the two courts below that "the plaintiff was the owner of the
goods and that was why the railway receipt was endorsed in his favor" he is certainly entitled to
maintain the suit. In this case there is no reference to the almost perennial controversy in the courts
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/130044/ 17Union Of India vs Jashan Mal & Co. on 8 April, 1976
in India on the question of the right to sue the carrier. The question raised before the Supreme Court
was a limited one, whether the consignor, who admittedly was the original owner, had the right to
sue when he consigned the goods to another or had endorsed the railway receipt in favor of another.
In one case no claim was made by the consignee that he had the right to sue and, therefore, the
various questions that arose in the earlier decisions or the propositions on which they were
considered did not arise. In the other set of cases also the right to sue was claimed by the endorsee
on the basis that he was the owner of the goods and the right was upheld on the basis of concurrent
finding of fact to that effect in his favor. Nothing in this decision, therefore, to my mind, had any
impact on the question as to the right of a bare consignee or of a bare endorsee to sue, nor were any
of the propositions enunciated by Subba Rao, J. were cither raised or examined. This decision, to my
mind, is a mere reiteration, and I say so with utmost respect, of the well known principle that the
consignor is ordinarily entitled to sue being party to the contract of carriage as well as being owner
of the goods and transfer of property in the goods to another or of assignment of the contract of
carriage in favor of another or a special contract with. the transferee alone could divest such a
consignor- owner of the right to sue. It is also a re-affirmation of the well established legal position
that where the consignee had, by virtue of the arrangement between the consignor and the
consignee, become the repository of a title to the goods he was entitled to sue. The various other
facets of the problem were left untouched.
(21) There is, however, an aspect of the matter which creates an insurmountable impediment in the
way of the .respondents. While likening the railway receipt to a bill of lading may have the effect of
equating a consingee or an endorsee to the position of a consignee or an endorsee of a bill of lading
by virtue of the provisions of the Bills of Lading Act in England and in India the basic premises of
the right to sue from that is that the consignee and the endorsee arc considered in law to be the
repository of the property in the goods as well as the assignment of the contract of carriage. But
what happens where the plaintiff on his own showing, as in the present case, slates that he was a
person to whom the goods had been sent by the owner not in the course of transfer by sale or
otherwise or for consideration or by way of pledge, etc. but as a commission agent for eventual sale
on behalf of the consignor. The question arises if such a person would be within the rule that could
be laid down by virtue of the observations of Subba Rao, J. It appears to me that such a person, on
his own showing, would be beyond that rule because he claims to be a consignee not in his own right
but as a consignee who has been entrusted with the duty to sell goods on behalf of the principal.
Such a person could not, therefore, claim by such a consignment any rights in relation to the
property or in relation to the contract of carriage in addition to the bare right to receive the goods
and to give a valid discharge. Shri Bhatia, however, raised an interesting argument that the
respondents being commission agents to whom the goods had been entrusted by the owners for the
purpose of sale, could maintain a suit because of two reasons, namely (1) they had sufficiently
actionable interest in the property because they would have the prospect to earn commission on the
sale of it; (2) they were constituted bailees of the goods by the owners and by virtue of the contract
of bailment had a special property in the goods. None of these contentions, to my mind, can stand
closer scrutiny. The prospect that a commission agent may have of earning commission on the sale
of goods consigned to him by the owner cannot be said to be a right in the goods or any property in
the goods. It only makes the commission agent, at best, a person who is interested in the goods. A
mere prospect to earn commission on the sale of goods belonging to another does not confer any

right or property in the goods which may be actionable so as to justify an action for damages against
the railways. The plea of bailment is of no avail because there is nothing to indicate that a contract of
bailment came into existence between the consignor and the consignee when the goods were handed
over by the consignor to the carrier. If it had, then obviously when the goods were lost in transit or
were damaged the consignee had actionable property in the goods because a bailee in law, being
bound to lake as much care of the property as he would of his own, or under an obligation to the
consignor and there was, therefore, the corresponding special property that he had in the goods. The
goods were being sent of course for being sold on commission and the contract of carriage itself was
a contract of bailment between the consignor and the Railway administration. The contract of
bailment between the consignor and the consignee would have come into existence after the goods
had been delivered to the consignee by the carrier. Until then there was no contract of bailment
between the consignor and the consignee with the result that until such a time the consignee had no
obligation to the consignor and could not, therefore, have any special property in the goods as a
bailee which would have entitled him to sue the Railway administration. In case property in the
goods was intended to be passed to the consignee or the endorsee or where, for example, the
consignee or the endorsee may have paid consideration for the sale, as in the case of Ghaniandi Lal
Nanhey Mal (supra), the position of such a consignee or endorsee would be different. Similarly, if at
the time of delivering the goods to the carriage the consignor intended to create a contract of
bailment in favor of the consignee, the carriage of goods by the earner being at the risk of the
consignee, such a consignee would also be in a different position. None of these positions, however,
obtain in the present case, in view of the limited relationship that is claimed by the respondents as a
basis of the right to sue.
(22) In the result, while Mr. Bhatia succeeds on the broad proposition canvassed by him, the appeal
and the revisions of the Union must be accepted, with the result that all the three suits would stand
dismissed. In the peculiar circumstances of the case, however, there- would be no costs.
(23) Before parting with this case it is necessary to invite attention to two important aspects of the
controversy that has been raging in the courts in India during the last over 50 years. In the first
instance, it is useful to recall the observations made by Bachawat, 1. in which have been extracted
above and in which the learned Judge added a forceful postscript expressing a strong wish that the
law was otherwise than what the learned Judge was compelled to hold. This was followed by an
equally emphatic expression of elation by Subba Rao, J. in the case of Morvi Merchantile Bank
(supra) which has also been extracted above, putting a virtual seal of approval on the proposition
that a railway receipt ought to be assimilated to a bill of lading for all purposes to facilitate the
course of trade. Lastly the observations of Ramaswami, J. in the minority opinion in the above case,
which have also been extracted above, also bring out in bold relief that the question whether a
railway receipt was to be assimilated to a bill of lading for all purposes was not a matter for judicial
determination but posed a problem for legislative considcra!.ion. It appears to me that the question
as to the right to sue a carrier has been the subject matter of more than the necessary controversy
and there is a strong case for consideration if legislative action on the lines on which the Bills of
Lading Act, 1856 was passed is called for to put an end to the controversy and such a step would be
consistent with the need to facilitate the movement of goods in the course of trade.

Secondly, review of the decisions spread over the last half a century brings out a very unfortunate
feature of the litigation policy of the Railway Administration. The decided cases indicate that the
Railway Administration had been taking absolutely inconsistent and diametrically opposite pleas
depending on the case set up by the plaintiff. If a consignor filed a suit it was claimed that the
consignee alone could sue merely by virtue of the fact that he was mentioned as the consignee in the
railway receipt. Where, however, a consignee was the plaintiff the right to sue was found by the
Railway Administration only in the consignor in spite of the nature of the transaction which led to
the movement of the goods from 'the consigner to the consignee. This only manifests a wholly
unjustified anxiety to resist the claim exactly like an ordinary litigant would with a view to put off
the evil day, as it were. This, to my mind, is a very unhealthy and unfortunate feature of the
litigation policy of the Railway Administration. It has often been pointed out that in the field of
employment the state and its various units must be ideal employers. In the same way it is proper
and reasonable that in the field of litigation the state and its units must be ideal litigants so that the
various pros and cons of a defense are properly assessed before embarking on a course of futile
litigation. The purpose of litigation is not to stall a valid claim but to seek an adjudication of real
questions in controversy between the parties whether of facts or of law. There is, therefore, a strong
case for a proper reorientation of the litigation policy of the Railway Administration.
