JUDGMENT These suits are filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, for
setting aside the award dated 23.11.2013 passed by sole Arbitrator in CMP No.126/2008.
2) As both suits are arising out of single award dated 23.11.2013, for the convenience of the Court,
they are taken together for passing common judgment.
3) Suit in A.S.No.08/2014 is filed by Respondents No.2, 3, 5 and 6 and suit in A.S.No.37/2014 is
filed by Respondents No.1 and 4 before the Arbitral Tribunal against Claimant, who is Defendant
No.1 in both suits. For convenience of the Court, parties are referred to as 'Claimant' and
'Respondents' as they were referred to in arbitration proceedings.
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014
4) In brief, Respondents' case is that Claimant entered into Memorandum of Agreement dated
14.01.1994 [MoU] with Dr.Y.V.Krupa Shankar, Sri.Ashok P. Narang and Sri.D.Ravishankar in
respect of property bearing Sy.Nos.68/2A, 70/1 and 71/1, measuring 05 Acres and 26 guntas of
Allasandra Village, Yelahanka Hobli, Bangalore North Taluk [for brevity 'Property'], for the purpose
of Joint Development. As they failed to comply with the terms of MoU, Claimant filed suit for
specific performance of MoU in O.S. No.4208/1995 on the file of City Civil Judge at Bangalore,
wherein, Respondent No.1 was arrayed as party. Said suit came to be compromised and compromise
decree came to be passed, whereunder, Respondent No.1 agreed to convey 4.25% of undivided
share, right, title and interest in the property to Claimant. Pursuant to compromise decree,
Respondents No.1 and 2 entered into Agreement of Sale dated 14.11.2003 with the Claimant
agreeing to sell 4.25% of undivided right in the property, which is AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014
described as 'B' and 'C' schedule property in Agreement of Sale dated 14.11.2003.
5) It is stated that Claimant raised dispute under the Agreement of Sale dated 14.11.2003. Sole
Arbitrator was appointed in CMP filed by Claimant before the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka and
impugned award came to be passed.
6) Respondents No.2, 3, 5 and 6 have challenged the award on the following grounds :
(a) Award contains decision on matters beyond the scope of submission to
arbitration.
(b) Award is in conflict with public policy of India as the same is passed without
appreciating the relevant evidence on record and without correct appreciation of
substantive law relating to specific performance.
(c) Respondent No.6 is not a party to arbitration agreement and therefore, award
could not be passed against Respondent No.6. Arbitral Tribunal, therefore, exceeded
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 its jurisdiction in passing the award against Respondent
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119121776/ 3) M/S.Oikos Renaissance vs ) M/S.Aum Builders on 18 December, 2020
No.6.
7) In addition to the above grounds, Respondents No.1 and 4 have questioned the award on the
following grounds :
(a) Arbitration Agreement contemplates the jurisdiction of Courts in entertaining the
specific performance and therefore, finding of Arbitral Tribunal is contrary to the
Agreement arrived at between the parties.
(b) Award is passed in contravention of public policy of India as no reasons are
assigned by Arbitral Tribunal in rejecting the counter claim.
For all these grounds, Respondents pray for setting aside the award.
8) Claimant, in its written statement, justifies the award granting the alternative relief of damages
instead of specific performance.
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014
9) It is stated that suits do not meet any of the parameters stipulated in Section 34 of the Arbitration
and Conciliation Act, 1996. There are no valid grounds to set aside the award. Hence, prays for
dismissal of the suits.
10) Heard learned Counsel for Respondents and Claimant. Perused the written arguments filed by
both Respondents and Claimant and also perused the records.
11) Point that arises for consideration is :
" Whether Respondents have made out any of the grounds as enumerated in Section
34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 to set aside the award dated
23.11.2013 passed by sole Arbitrator?"
12) My answer to above point is in the negative for the following :
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 REASONS
13) Respondents pray for setting aside the award dated 23.11.2013, whereby sole
Arbitrator directed the Respondents to pay to the Claimant a sum of
Rs.12,79,88,000/- with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from 14.08.2008 till
the date of payment within three months from the date of receipt of the award, failing
which, Respondents are directed to pay interest at the rate of 15% per annum from
14.08.2008 till the date of payment.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119121776/ 4) M/S.Oikos Renaissance vs ) M/S.Aum Builders on 18 December, 2020
submits that present suits challenging the award are made on 25.01.2014 and 08.04.2014
respectively and thus, suit is to be decided as per provisions of Section 34 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996, as it stood prior to commencement of the Arbitration and Conciliation
(Amendment) Act, 2015. It is submitted that amendments made to Section 34 of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 as per the 2015 AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 Amendment Act would not apply
to the present suit, because present suit was filed prior to the coming into force of the 2015
Amendment Act. In support of their submission, they have relied on the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Ssangyong Engineering and Construction Company Limited vs. National
Highways Authority of India (NHAI), [(2019) 15 SCC 131]. Para-19 of the judgment reads thus :
"19. There is no doubt that in the present case, fundamental changes have been made
in the law. The expansion of "public policy of India" in ONGC v. Saw Pipes Ltd. [Saw
Pipes"] and ONGC v. Western Geco International Ltd. ["Western Geco"] has been
done away with, and a new ground of "patent illegality", with inbuilt exceptions, has
been introduced. Given this, we declare that Section 34, as amended, will apply only
to Section 34 applications that have been made to the Court on or after 23-10-2015,
irrespective of the fact that the arbitration proceedings may have commenced prior to
that date."
15) Award was made on 23.11.2013. The Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, came
into force on 23.10.2015. Suits were filed on 25.01.2014 and 08.04.2014 respectively. Admittedly,
suits were filed under Section 34 of the AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
1996, prior to the coming into force of the 2015 Amendment Act. In that circumstance, it is
necessary to have regard to the principles of law laid down in Oil & Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. vs.
Saw Pipes Ltd., [(2003) 5 SCC 705], wherein Para-74 reads thus :
"74. In the result, it is held that :
(A) (1) the court can set aside the arbitral award under Section 34(2) of the Act if the
party making the application furnishes proof that :
(i) a party was under some
incapacity, or
(ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have
subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law for the time being in
force; or
(iii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment
of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his
case; or
(iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within
the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119121776/ 5) M/S.Oikos Renaissance vs ) M/S.Aum Builders on 18 December, 2020
the scope of the submissions to arbitration.
(2) The court may set aside the award:
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014
(i)(a) if the composition of the Arbitral Tribunal was not in accordance with the
agreement of the parties,
(b) failing such agreement, the composition of the Arbitral Tribunal was not in
accordance with Part I of the Act.
(ii) if the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with :
(a) the agreement of the parties, or
(b) failing such agreement, the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with Part I
of the Act.
However, exception for setting aside the award on the ground of composition of
Arbitral Tribunal or illegality of arbitral procedure is that the agreement should not
be in conflict with the provisions of Part I of the Act from which parties cannot
derogate.
(c) If the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal is in contravention of the provisions of the Act or
any other substantive law governing the parties or is against the terms of the contract. (3) The award
could be set aside if it is against the public policy of India, that is to say, if it is contrary to :
(a) fundamental policy of Indian law; or
(b) the interest of India; or
(c) justice or morality; or
(d) if it is patently illegal.
(4) It could be challenged :
(a) as provided under Section 13(5); and
(b) Section 16(6) of the Act. "

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119121776/ 6) M/S.Oikos Renaissance vs ) M/S.Aum Builders on 18 December, 2020
16) In light of above principles of law, grounds urged by Respondents for setting
aside the award have to be assailed. In concise, Respondents have urged the following
grounds :
(a) Award is made in contravention of provisions of substantive law relating to
Specific Relief Act, 1963 and binding effect of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court.
(b) Award is made in contravention of the terms of agreement between the parties.
(c) Award is made in contravention of Section 31(3) of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 as Counter Claim of Respondents was rejected without
assigning any reasons.
17) Before assailing the grounds urged by Respondents, it is relevant to mention the Claims made by
Claimant before the Arbitral Tribunal and the award made by the Arbitral Tribunal.
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014
18) Reliefs sought for by Claimant has been extracted in Para-11 of the award, which read thus :
"11. Hence, the present claim petition has been filed by Claimant for the following
reliefs:
A. To execute and register in favour of the Claimant and/or to the Claimant's
nominee/s, agreement/s in respect of the Schedule 'B' property and the Schedule 'C'
property;
B. Jointly and severally pay to the Claimant the liquidated damages of Rs.15,29,730/-
being the liquidated damages from 15.08.2008 till 15.05.2009 together with the
interest thereon @ 15% per annum on delayed payments of liquidated damages.
C. Jointly and severally pay to the claimant liquidated damages of Rs.1,69,970/- per
month on or before 14th of every month till such time the Respondents deliver to the
Claimant and/or the Claimant's nominee/s the Schedule 'B' property and Schedule 'C'
property and execute and register deeds of absolute sale in respect of Schedule 'B'
property and Schedule 'C' property in favour of the Claimant and/or Claimant's
nominee/s or in the alternative to prayers (a) to (c) D. In lieu of specific performance,
jointly and severally pay to the Claimant damages of Rs.16,19,70,000/- only together
with interest thereon at 15% per annum from 14.08.2008 till the date of payment;
E. The cost of these proceedings;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119121776/ 7) M/S.Oikos Renaissance vs ) M/S.Aum Builders on 18 December, 2020
F. Any other order that this Hon'ble Tribunal may deem fit in the facts and
circumstances of the case."
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014
19) Operative portion of the award reads as follows :
"A. The Respondents are directed to pay to the Claimant jointly and severally a sum
of Rs.12,79,88,000/- (Rupees Twelve Crores Seventy Nine Lakhs Eighty Eight
thousand only) (Rs.4,000 x 31,997 Sq.Ft. of built up area) with interest at the rate of
12% per annum from 14.08.2008 till the date of payment within a period of 3 months
from the date of receipt of this award, failing which, the said sum will fetch interest @
15% per annum from the date till the date of payment.
B. The Respondents are further directed to pay a sum of Rs.7,00,000/- (Rupees
Seven Lakhs only) to the Claimant towards the cost of these proceedings."
(a) Respondents' contentions regarding award passed in contravention of the provisions of
substantive law relating to Specific Relief Act, 1963 :
20) Respondents' contention is that prayer (D) of Claim Petition is for award of damages in lieu of
specific performance, and it is contended that Issue No.4 framed by the Arbitral Tribunal clarifies
the fact that the relief seeking for a direction to execute and register an Agreement of Sale in favour
of Claimant was a prayer for specific performance of Agreement of Sale.
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014
21) It is further contended that, while examining Issue No.4, the Arbitral Tribunal has come to the
conclusion that first relief sought for by Claimant could not be classified as a prayer for specific
performance of Agreement dated 14.11.2003 and in that circumstance, question of granting the
relief of specific performance did not arise and granting of damages in lieu of specific performance
of Agreement of Sale also did not arise.
22) In support of their contention, they have placed reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble High
Court of Culcutta in Gopi Nath Sen and others vs. Bahadurmul Dulichand and others, [1978 SCC
onLine Cal 270]. In para-3, it is held thus :
"3. ..... In other words, the Court must be in a position to consider that the plaintif
was otherwise entitled to claim specific performance. If that condition would not be
fulfilled then there could be no question of the court's exercising that power of
granting relief by way of damages in lieu thereof. The expression "in lieu of specific
performance" means and signifies that the relief by way of damages is granted in
place of specific performance or in substitution thereof so that adequate relief might
be awarded to the plaintif who was otherwise entitled to such specific AS.08/2014 &
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119121776/ 8) M/S.Oikos Renaissance vs ) M/S.Aum Builders on 18 December, 2020
AS.37/2014 performance. Once the plaintif would abandon his case of specific
performance then that would be an end of the matter so far as the relief by way of
damages in lieu of specific performance was concerned. ......."
23) Further reliance has been placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Harjeet
Singh and another vs. Amrik Singh and another, [(2005) 12 SCC 270], wherein it has been held that
"Plaintif found not to have been ready and willing to perform the contract, in such a case there is no
question of plaintif being compensated."
24) In the backdrop of above judgments, Respondents submit that Claimant, having relinquished its
claim for specific performance of Agreement of Sale, was dis-entitled from obtaining the relief of
damages in lieu of specific performance of Agreement of Sale. Thus, impugned award is contrary to
the settled principles of law.
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014
25) On the contrary, Claimant submits that it never abandoned or gave up its claim for specific
performance in the arbitration proceedings. Arbitral Tribunal has framed a specific Issue at Issue
No.4 to the effect that "whether Claimant is entitled to specific performance?" and said Issue has
been answered in favour of Claimant. It is submitted that judgments relied upon by Respondents are
not applicable to the case of Claimant.
26) Award makes it clear that Arbitral Tribunal has framed Issues with respect to prayers sought for
by Claimant in Claim Petition at Issues No.4 to 6. They read thus :
"4. Whether the claimant proves that he is entitled for an award in terms of the
prayer for a direction to Respondent Nos. 1 & 4 to execute and register agreements of
sale in respect of 'B' and 'C' properties in favour of the claimant or its nominees under
the agreement dated 14.11.2003 pursuant to the consent decree dated 14.11.2003
passed in O.S.No.4208/1995, in terms of Respondent Nos. 1 & 4's admission and
undertaking vide its letter dated 30.11.2006, to register the agreement of sale in
respect of the above mentioned properties in favour of claimant or his nominees?
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014
5. Whether the claimant proves that it is entitled for the liquidated damages together
with interest thereon at 15% per annum in terms of the agreement dated 14.11.2003?
6. Whether the claimant proves that in the alternative to prayers (a) to (c) the
claimant is entitled to damages of Rs.16,99,70,000/- together with interest thereon
at 15% per annum?"
27) Findings of the Arbitral Tribunal on Issue No.4 read as follows :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119121776/ 9) M/S.Oikos Renaissance vs ) M/S.Aum Builders on 18 December, 2020
"35. ........ He made a distinction that in the present proceedings unlike to the
decision of the Supreme Court referred above, Ex.C-6 agreement of sale is pursuant
to the compromise petition and consent decree (Ex.C-4 & C5) and Ex.C6 is a binding
agreement and the said agreement is neither cancelled nor terminated. In the present
case all the parties accepted, admitted and reiterated their obligations under the
binding agreement. He also further pointed out that the prayer could not be classified
as prayer for specific performance of the agreement dated 14.11.2003 (Ex.C6), is a
prayer to comply of the statutory obligation under KOFA and fulfilling the obligation
undertaken in Ex.C-25. I accede to the submission made by the learned advocate for
the Claimant and hold issue No.4 in favour of the Claimant. "
28) Having regard to above findings, Respondents contend that Claimant has abandoned the relief
of specific performance of Agreement of AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 Sale. They further contend that
once the relief of specific performance is abandoned, the question of granting of damages does not
arise at all.
29) A bare reading of the findings on Issue No.4, they do not in any way signify that Claimant has
abandoned its relief of specific performance of Agreement of Sale. Claimant has sought for 3 main
reliefs at (A) to (C). Relief 'A' is to execute and register Agreement; relief 'B' is with respect to
liquidated damages from 15.08.2008 to 15.05.2009 and relief 'C' is for liquidated damages at the
rate of Rs.1,69,970/- per month till Respondents deliver to Claimant, 'B' and 'C' schedule property
and execute and register absolute sale deed in respect of 'B' and 'C' schedule property.
30) In prayer 'A', Claimant sought for enforcement of statutory obligation which Respondent No.4
had undertaken in Ex.C-25. Submission recorded in findings that prayer 'A' AS.08/2014 &
AS.37/2014 could not be classified as prayer for specific performance of the Agreement dated
14.11.2003 cannot be extended to interpret that Claimant has abandoned the relief of specific
performance of Agreement of Sale as sought for in prayer 'B' and 'C'. At the most, it can be said that
submission as recorded infers that statutory obligation under The Karnataka Ownership Flats
(Regulation of the Promotion of Construction, Sale, Management and Transfer) Act, 1972 [KOFA]
cannot be enforced under Agreement of Sale dated 14.11.2003, because a separate measure has been
provided under KOPA. Thus, submission as to statutory obligation could not be classified as prayer
for specific performance of the Agreement of Sale, would not tantamount to abandonment of the
relief of specific performance and same does not dehors the specific performance sought for in
prayers 'B' and 'C'.
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014
31) Award goes to show that Arbitral Tribunal though answered Issue No.4 in favour of Claimant, it
did not grant specific relief sought for in prayer 'A' to 'C', instead, in its discretion it granted
damages in lieu of specific performance as sought for in prayer 'D'. Reasons for granting damages
have been stated while determining Issue No.6. Relevant portion of the findings of the Arbitral
Tribunal reads as follows :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119121776/ 10) M/S.Oikos Renaissance vs ) M/S.Aum Builders on 18 December, 2020
"38. ........ I have gone through the reliefs claimed by the Claimant. We should not
forget the fact that though a sanction was to be obtained and construction had to be
commenced within 9 months of agreement i.e 13.2.2004 and the project should be
completed and occupancy certificate had to be obtained within 48 months there
from, i.e before 13.08.2008, nothing has been done by the Respondents. The total
extent of land is 5 Acres 26 Guntas as could be seen from Ex.C-4, compromise decree,
Ex.C-5 Compromise Petition, Ex.C-6 agreement of sale dated 14.11.2003, Ex.C- 54
and Ex.C-55 agreement dated 14.11.2003, Ex.C-74 power of attorney, Ex.C18 Plaint in
OS 15719/2005, Ex.C-20 consent decree in OS 15791/2005, Ex.C-21 Memorandum of
Civil Petition of CRP 364/2007 and Ex.C22 Appeal grounds in MFA 2965/2005 and
admitted by all Respondents. ......"
"40. ...... In a case of this nature having regard to the fact that the construction of the
project has not been commenced even though it should have been AS.08/2014 &
AS.37/2014 completed on or before 13.08.2008, I am of the opinion that the
Claimant should be granted the alternative relief of payment of sum. We should not
forget the fact that during the pendency of these proceedings, the construction work
has been entrusted to Respondent No.6 who has been brought on record
subsequently. We do not know how many hands it will pass through. Even the
Respondents have to get over number of hurdles before getting the sanction plan so
as to start the construction and how much time it will take to complete the
construction is left to one's own imagination. Having regard to the bitter relationship
between the parties and the way litigations went on between them, this Tribunal is
not sure whether Respondents are eager to complete the project as it should be done.
I am aware of the forfeiture clause in the agreement Ex.C-6. Even then, in the interest
of both the parties I am of the opinion that the alternative relief claimed by the
Claimant has to be granted."
In this background, the Arbitral Tribunal instead of granting the relief as sought for in prayer 'A' to
'C', granted alternative relief of damages in lieu of prayer 'A' to 'C'.
32) In the light of the findings of the Arbitral Tribunal, it is necessary to have regard to Section 21 of
the Specific Relief Act, 1963. Section 21 reads thus :
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 "21. Power to award compensation in certain cases.- (1) In
a suit for specific performance of a contract, the plaintif may also claim compensation
for its breach, either in addition to, or in substitution of, such performance.
(2) If, in any such suit, the court decides that specific performance ought not to be granted, but that
there is a contract between the parties which has been broken by the defendant, and that the plaintif
is entitled to compensation for that breach, it shall award him such compensation accordingly.
(3) If, in any such suit, the court decides that specific performance ought to be granted, but that it is
not sufficient to satisfy the justice of the case, and that some compensation for breach of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119121776/ 11) M/S.Oikos Renaissance vs ) M/S.Aum Builders on 18 December, 2020
contract should also be made to the plaintif, it shall award him such compensation accordingly.
(4) In determining the amount of any compensation awarded under this section, the court shall be
guided by the principles specified in section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (9 of 1872).
(5) No compensation shall be awarded under this section unless the plaintif has claimed such
compensation in his plaint :
provided that where the plaintif has not claimed any such compensation in the plaint, the court
shall, at any stage of the proceeding, allow him to amend the plaint on such terms as may be just, for
including a claim for such compensation.
Explanation .- The circumstance that the contract has become incapable of specific performance
does not preclude the court from exercising the jurisdiction conferred by this section."
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014
33) A bare reading of Section 21(1) makes it clear that in a suit for specific
performance of contract, plaintiff may claim compensation in addition to or in
substitution of specific performance. Under Section 21(2), if Court decides that
specific performance ought not to be granted, it shall award compensation to
plaintiff, and under Section 21(3), if Court decides that specific performance ought to
be granted, but same does not satisfy the justice, it shall award compensation to
plaintiff. Section 21(5) mandates that no compensation shall be granted unless
plaintiff has claimed the same in his plaint.
Further, explanation to Section 21 makes it clear that even contract has become incapable of specific
performance, which does not preclude the Court from exercising the jurisdiction under Section 21.
34) In the present case, Claimant sought for specific performance of contract at prayer 'A' to C' and
in lieu of prayer 'A' to 'C', it sought for the relief of damages at prayer 'D'. Arbitral Tribunal held
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 Issue No.4 in favour of Claimant. It exercised its jurisdiction not to grant
specific performance. Having regard to the breach of Agreement of Sale by Respondents, it granted
the relief of damages.
35) In Gopi Nath Sen's case (supra), it has been observed that plaintiff had abandoned his claim for
specific performance and he was not ready and willing to perform his obligations under the
Agreement. Similarly, in Harjeet Singh's case (supra), plaintiff found not to have been ready and
willing to perform the contract.
36) In Gopi Nath Sen's case (supra), it has been specifically held that if damages would be awarded
in lieu of or in substitution of specific performance then that would amount to granting of a suitable
relief. It is worthwhile to read para-3 of the judgment, which reads thus :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119121776/ 12) M/S.Oikos Renaissance vs ) M/S.Aum Builders on 18 December, 2020
"3. In my opinion, the principle under which damages will be awarded under Section
73 of the Indian Contract Act will be diferent from the principle involved in damages
which will be awarded in lieu of AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 specific performance. In
the case of damages in lieu of specific performance the same does not result directly
or consequentially from out of a breach of a contract as is the case under Section 73 of
the Indian Contract Act. There might be circumstances when the plaintif might be
entitled to specific performance but the Court in its discretion might find that in the
special facts of the case the plaintif should not be awarded specific performance of
the contract; but if damages would be awarded in lieu or in substitution thereof then
that would amount to granting of a suitable relief. ........"
37) The Hon'ble Bombay High Court, in Haresh Advani vs. Suraj Jagtiani, [Appeal No.425/2015,
Decided on 21/22-09-2017], was pleased to refer the Gopi Nath Sen's case and to explain thus :
"49. In Gopi Nath Sen and others vs. Bhadurmul Dulichand and others, i.e. Calcutta
High Court case as well, we find that the principle is that damages under Section 73
of the Contract Act is a diferent claim from the award of compensation in lieu of
specific performance. ......... In Calcutta case as well, the Trial Judge had awarded
damages to the extent of Rs.25,000/- in lieu of specific performance. The Appeal
Court was of the view that this was an error. The learned Judge failed to consider the
evidence before the Court and could not have reached such a conclusion after
exercising his discretion. It was noted clearly that the suit after amendment of the
assertion of readiness and willingness and deletion of the claim for specific
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 performance, was for damages simplicitor. Therefore,
diferent considerations arise on allowing such amendment."
38) Had the Claimant not sought for specific relief or had it abandoned or waived the specific relief
sought for, then, the contention of Respondents would be relevant to consider. In the instant case,
there is no such abandonment or waiver of the relief of specific performance.
39) In arbitral proceedings, Respondents contested the claim of Claimant with full knowledge that
Claimant had sought for specific performance of Agreement of Sale. Further, they have specifically
pleaded in the present suits that Claimant's claim is for specific performance of the Agreement of
Sale and in the alternative for damages. In that view, merely because prayer 'A' could not be
classified as prayer for specific performance, same cannot be construed that Plaintiff has abandoned
the specific relief.
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014
40) By relying upon the judgments in the case of Gopi Nath Sen and Harjeet Singh, Respondents
raised the question of Plaintiff's readiness and willingness in performing its part of the contract. In
Clause-1.3 of Agreement of Sale [Ex.C.6], vendors confirmed the receipt of entire sale consideration.
Statutory deposits would be payable by Plaintiff only when apartment is ready and against the
delivery of apartment. Moreover, in the award, Arbitral Tribunal has specifically observed the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119121776/ 13) M/S.Oikos Renaissance vs ) M/S.Aum Builders on 18 December, 2020
receipt of the sale consideration by Respondents. That being the case, no occasion would arise for
the Arbitral Tribunal to give its findings as to readiness and willingness as contemplated in Section
16 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. Hence, question of Plaintiff's proving readiness and willingness
did not arise at all.
41) Respondents' contention is that Agreement of Sale was one which could not be specifically
enforced in view of the bar contained under Section AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 14 of the Specific
Relief Act, 1963. Agreement of Sale entered into between Claimant and Respondents requires
constant supervision of the Court and same cannot be enforced under Section 14(d) of the Specific
Relief Act, 1963. In support of their contention, they rely on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme
Court in Vinod Seth vs. Devinder Bajaj and Another, [(2010) 8 SCC 1]. It is relevant to read para-12,
13, 14 and 15. They read thus:
" 12. It is doubtful whether the collaboration agreement, as alleged by the appellant,
is specifically enforceable, having regard to the prohibition contained in Sections
14(1)(b) and (d) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. The agreement propounded by the
appellant is not an usual agreement for sale/transfer, where the contract is
enforceable and if the defendant fails to comply with the decree for specific
performance, the court can have the contract performed by appointing a person to
execute the deed of sale/transfer under Order 21 Rule 32(5) of the Code of Civil
Procedure ("the Code", for short).
13. The agreement alleged by the appellant is termed by him as a commercial collaboration
agreement for development of a residential property of the respondents. Under the alleged
agreement, the obligations of the respondents are limited, that is, to apply to DDA for conversion of
the property from leasehold to freehold, to submit the AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 construction plan
to the authority concerned for sanction, and to deliver vacant possession of the suit property to the
appellant for development. But the appellant-plaintif has several obligations to perform when the
property is delivered, that is, to demolish the existing building, to construct a three-storeyed
building within one year in accordance with the agreed plan, deliver the first and second floors to
the respondents and also pay a token cash consideration of Rs.3,71,000. The performance of these
obligations by the appellant is dependent upon his personal qualifications and volition.
14. If the court should decree the suit as prayed by the appellant (the detailed prayer is extracted in
para 5 above) and direct specific performance of the "collaboration agreement" by the respondents,
it will not be practical or possible for the court to ensure that the appellant will perform his part of
the obligations, that is, demolish the existing structure, construct a three storeyed building as per
the agreed specifications within one year, and deliver free of cost, the two upper floors to the
respondents. Certain other questions also will arise for consideration. What will happen if DDA
refuses to convert the property from leasehold to freehold? What will happen if the construction
plan is not sanctioned in the manner said to have been agreed between the parties and the
respondents are not agreeable to any other plans of construction? Who will decide the specifications
and who will ensure the quality of the construction by the appellant?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119121776/ 14) M/S.Oikos Renaissance vs ) M/S.Aum Builders on 18 December, 2020
15. The alleged agreement being vague and incomplete, requires consensus, decisions or further
agreement on several minute details. It would also involve performance of a continuous duty by the
appellant which the court will not be able to supervise. The performance of the AS.08/2014 &
AS.37/2014 obligations of a developer/builder under a collaboration agreement cannot be compared
to the statutory liability of a landlord to reconstruct and deliver a shop premises to a tenant under a
rent control legislation, which is enforceable under the statutory provisions of the special law. A
collaboration agreement of the nature alleged by the appellant is not one that could be specifically
enforced. Further, as the appellant has not made an alternative prayer for compensation for breach,
there is also a bar in regard to award of any compensation under Section 21 of the Specific Relief
Act."
42) On the other hand, Claimant's submission is that suits filed by Respondents are squarely
covered by the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Olympus Superstructures Pvt. Ltd. vs.
Meena Vijay Khetan and Others, [(1999) 5 SCC 651]. In para-36, the Hon'ble Supreme Court was
pleased to observe thus :
"36. Further, as pointed in the Calcutta case merely because there is need for exercise
of discretion in case of specific performance, it cannot be said that only the civil court
can exercise such a discretion. ...."
43) Be that as it may. The question that arises is, whether Agreement of Sale entered into between
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 Claimant and Respondents is not specifically enforced and does it
partakes the nature of collaboration agreement or Joint Development Agreement?
44) To answer the above questions, it is necessary to look into the Agreement of Sale. Title of the
Agreement itself shows that it is an 'Agreement of Sale', whereunder, Respondents agreed to sell
4.25% of undivided right, title and interest in the land and 4.25% of constructed area along with
4.25% of total surface car parks, basement car park, terrace area and garden area within 57 months
from the date of Agreement of Sale. A bare reading of Agreement of Sale, it is crystal clear that this is
a simple agreement of sale of flats to the Claimant for sale consideration received by Respondents.
Certainly, it is not a collaboration agreement or Joint Development agreement in which owner of the
property enters into agreement with developer to develop the AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 property
and agrees to divide their respective shares in developed area.
45) Respondents rely upon Clause-6.1 of the Agreement of Sale and submit that the division of share
and determination of the location of 4.25% share of Claimant would be done by the parties by
mutual consent and recorded in writing. It is submitted that building to be constructed as described
in Annexure-F of Agreement of Sale and description provided in Annexure-F was not sufficient and
imprecise for Arbitral Tribunal to determine the exact nature of the building.
46) There is no scope for such submission because, first of all, Respondent No.1 being the owner of
the property entered into Joint Development Agreement with Respondent No.2 for development of
the property and sharing of developed area. In fact, agreement entered into between Respondents
No.1 and 2 is a Joint AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 Development Agreement. However, agreement
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119121776/ 15) M/S.Oikos Renaissance vs ) M/S.Aum Builders on 18 December, 2020
entered into between Claimant and Respondent No.1 is an Agreement of Sale, in which Respondent
No.2 arrayed as 'confirming party' in order to create liability. In Clause-6.1, the parties have agreed
that division of constructed area shall be done on the plan being sanctioned. This can be termed as
one of the conditions under the Agreement of Sale. Because of Clause-6.1, Agreement of Sale cannot
partake the nature of Joint Development Agreement. If the Agreement of Sale executed in favour of
Claimant is termed as joint development agreement, then, Agreements of Sale to be executed by
Respondents in favour of prospective purchasers would also be construed as Joint Development
Agreement. If such interpretation is made, there would be no sanctity to the sale agreement and
same would become nugatory as to its enforceability.
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014
47) In Vinod Seth's case, it has been specifically held that "a collaboration agreement of the nature is
not specifically enforced". Para-15 is extracted thus :
"15. ..... A collaboration agreement of the nature alleged by the appellant is not one
that could be specifically enforced. Further, as the appellant has not made an
alternative prayer for compensation for breach, there is also a bar in regard to award
of any compensation under Section 21 of the Specific Relief Act."
48) Even if it is assumed that Agreement of Sale entered into between Claimant and Respondents
No.1 and 2 is a collaboration agreement as contended by Respondents, then, there would be no
impediment to grant compensation for breach of Agreement under Section 21 of the Specific Relief
Act, 1963. In the instant case, Claimant has rightly claimed alternative prayer for compensation for
breach and the Arbitral Tribunal has rightly granted the same. In that view, there is no substance in
the contention of Respondents that Agreement of Sale could not be specifically enforced in view of
the bar AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 contained in Section 14 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963.
49) All these aspects of the matter make it clear that the Arbitral Tribunal has exercised its
discretion within the purview of Section 14 and 16 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 and rightly
awarded damages for breach under Section 21 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. No such
contravention of the provisions of substantive law is attributable to the award.
(b) Contention regarding award is made in contravention of the terms of agreement between the
parties -
50) Respondents No.1 and 4 contend that award is made in contravention of Clause-2 of Agreement
of Sale dated 14.11.2003. Clause-2 of the Agreement stipulates pre-estimated liquidated damages
that would be occasioned if the Respondents fail to deliver the possession of the apartment
according to the stipulated time. As per Clause-2 of the AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 Agreement, the
Arbitral Tribunal was bound to award liquidated damages as estimated in the Agreement under
Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act. Instead, the Arbitral Tribunal has ventured beyond the scope
of the Agreement of Sale and Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act and therefore, award is liable to
be set aside for being patently illegal and in conflict with public policy of India.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119121776/ 16) M/S.Oikos Renaissance vs ) M/S.Aum Builders on 18 December, 2020
51) In support of their contention, they have placed reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Kailash Nath Associates vs. Delhi Development Authority and another, [(2015) 4
SCC 136]. In Para-43, the Hon'ble Supreme Court was pleased to hold thus :
"43. On a conspectus of the above authorities, the law on compensation for breach of
contract under Section 74 can be stated to be as follows :
43.1. Where a sum is named in a contract as a liquidated amount payable by way of
damages, the party complaining of a breach can receive as reasonable compensation
such liquidated amount only if it is a genuine pre-estimate of damages fixed by both
parties and found to be such by the court. In other cases, where a sum is named in a
contract as a liquidated AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 amount payable by way of
damages, only reasonable compensation can be awarded not exceeding the amount
so stated. Similarly, in cases where the amount fixed is in the nature of penalty, only
reasonable compensation can be awarded not exceeding the penalty so stated. In
both cases, the liquidated amount or penalty is the upper limit beyond which the
court cannot grant reasonable compensation.
43.2. Reasonable compensation will be fixed on well-known principles that are
applicable to the law of contract, which are to be found inter alia in Section 73 of the
Contract Act.
43.3. Since Section 74 awards reasonable compensation for damage or loss caused by
a breach of contract, damage or loss caused is a sine qua non for the applicability of
the section.
43.4. The section applies whether a person is a plaintif or a defendant in a suit.
43.5. The sum spoken of may already be paid or be payable in future.
43.6. The expression "whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been
caused thereby" means that where it is possible to prove actual damage or loss, such
proof is not dispensed with. It is only in cases where damage or loss is difficult or
impossible to prove that the liquidated amount named in the contract, if a genuine
pre-estimate of damage or loss, can be awarded."
52) Respondents No. 2, 3, 5 and 6 contend that Arbitral Tribunal has arrived at Rs.4,000/- per
square feet as the market value for the built up area of 31,997 square feet without any basis.
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 Parties have expressly agreed in Clause-2 that there shall be payment to
the Claimant for breach of contract, which is pre-estimated genuine liquidated damages. Even
assuming that the Claimant has suffered any losses, at the most, he would be entitled the
pre-estimated damages from 13.08.2008 at the rate of Rs.5/- per square foot on the super built up
area. Super built up area has been determined at 31,997 square feet, thus, damages, if any, will have
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119121776/ 17) M/S.Oikos Renaissance vs ) M/S.Aum Builders on 18 December, 2020
to be calculated at Rs.5/- per square foot per month computed from 13.08.2008 which works out to
Rs.19,19,820/- per year. If it is computed till 13.08.2020, then the compensation amount payable
can at the most be only Rs.2,30,37,840/-. Thus, award of Rs.12,79,88,000/- with interest at 12% per
annum from 14.08.2018 is arbitrary, illegal, perverse, irrational, quixotic, unfair and unreasonable
and no reasonable person would have arrived at such a conclusion.
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014
53) In support of their contention, they have placed reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in ONGC Ltd vs. Saw Pipes Limited, [AIR 2003 SC 2629], which has been
considered in Kailash Nath Associates' case.
54) Tone and tenor of the above contention makes it clear that Respondents have sought to contend
that in the Agreement alternative relief of damages in lieu of specific performance has been
quantified by way of liquidated damages at Rs.5/- per square foot per month and therefore, damages
could not be more than the quantified liquidated damages of Rs.5/- per square foot, hence, award is
contrary to the Agreement.
55) Before assailing the contention of Respondents, it is relevant to look into the Clause-2 of the
Agreement of Sale. Clause-2 reads thus :
"2) TIME FOR COMPLETION :
The Consenting Witness shall commence the construction work on the AS.08/2014 &
AS.37/2014 Schedule A property within 9 months from the date of execution of this
agreement and shall complete the construction in all respects fit for human
habitation including obtaining the Occupancy Certificate for the construction within
48 months from the date of the plan sanction of 57 months from the execution of this
agreement whichever is earlier.
In the event of the Vendor and/or Consenting Witness failing to hand over possession
of the Schedule 'B' Property and Schedule 'C' Property to the Purchaser complete in
all respects with all facilities, amenities and finishes ready for occupation within the
stipulated period, the Vendor and/or the Consenting Witness shall jointly and
severally be liable to pay to the Purchaser liquidated damages at the rate of Rs.5/-
(Rupees Five Only) per square foot of the super built area (i.e. the Schedule 'C'
Property) per month from the due date of delivery to the actual date of delivery of
such Constructed Area not yet delivered. This amount is based on the rental loss that
would be sufered by the Purchaser as acknowledged and recognized by the Vendor
and/or Consenting Witness. This liquidated damage is a fair quantification of the loss
that would be occasioned to be the Purchaser and/or its nominee(s) and cannot be
contested, questioned or disputed. This liquidated damage is to be paid to on a
monthly basis to the Purchaser and/or its nominee(s)."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119121776/ 18) M/S.Oikos Renaissance vs ) M/S.Aum Builders on 18 December, 2020
56) A bare reading of the above Clause, it makes it clear that if the Respondents fail to hand over
possession of 'B' and 'C' schedule property to the Claimant within the stipulated time, they shall be
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 liable to pay liquidated damages at the rate of Rs.5/- per square foot per
month from the due date of delivery to the actual date of delivery of such 'B' and 'C' schedule
property.
57) As per Clause-2, Respondents shall commence the work within 9 months from the date of
execution of the Agreement and shall complete the same within 48 months from the date of plan
sanction or 57 months from the date of execution of the Agreement. If date of execution of
Agreement is taken into consideration, Respondents should have completed the work and handed
over the possession of 'B' and 'C' schedule property on or before 14.08.2008, which is due date for
handing over the possession.
58) However, as the Respondents failed to deliver possession of 'B' and 'C' schedule property,
Claimant has filed claim petition seeking specific performance of the contract and alternative relief
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 of damages as contemplated under Section 21 of the Specific Relief Act,
1963.
59) In the award, it has been specifically mentioned that no work was commenced by Respondents
and even during the arbitral proceedings, construction work was entrusted to Respondent No.6. In
this background, the Arbitral Tribunal was not inclined to grant specific performance, instead, it
granted alternative relief of damages. This alternative relief of damages cannot be equated with the
liquidated damages as provided in Clause-2 of the Agreement. Absolutely, alternative damages in
lieu of specific performance as provided in Section 21 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 is different
from the liquidated damages as provided in Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act.
60) A bare perusal of the prayer sought for by Claimant makes it clear that in prayer 'B' and first
part of prayer 'C', Claimant claims liquidated AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 damages as per Clause-2 of
the Agreement. Arbitral Tribunal, for the reasons assigned, did not grant prayer 'A' to 'C', instead,
alternative relief of damages in lieu of specific performance was granted as provided in Section 21 of
the Specific Relief Act, 1963. The Hon'ble Calcutta High Court in Gopi Nath Sen case (supra) has
specifically held that "The principle under which damages will be awarded under Section 73 of the
Indian Contract Act will be diferent from the principle involved in damages which will be awarded in
lieu of specific performance. In the case of damages in lieu of specific performance the same does
not result directly or consequentially from out of a breach of a contract as is the case under Section
73 of the Indian Contract Act".
61) If the Arbitral Tribunal decides to grant specific performance of the Agreement, stating that
Respondents shall execute the registered Sale Deed in favour of Claimant in respect of 'B' and 'C'
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 schedule property and to award damages till the delivery of 'B' and 'C'
schedule property as prayed in prayer 'B' and 1st portion of prayer 'C', then, such damages would be
regarded as liquidated damages as contemplated in Clause-2 of the Agreement and in that
circumstance, principles of law laid down in Section 74 shall be adhered. In this case, Arbitral
Tribunal granted damages in lieu of specific performance as provided in Section 21 of the Specific
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119121776/ 19) M/S.Oikos Renaissance vs ) M/S.Aum Builders on 18 December, 2020
Relief Act, 1963. Hence, the principles of law laid down in Kailash Nath Associates case (supra)
cannot be availed of by Respondents. Thus, it can be fairly said that learned Arbitrator acted within
the purview of the Agreement of Sale, while making the award.
62) Coming to the quantum of damages being granted in lieu of specific performance, Arbitral
Tribunal has placed reliance on the contentions of the Respondents and the Claimant to decide the
market value of 'B' and 'C' schedule property.
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 Claimant's contention is that the market value of the property is
Rs.5,000/- per square foot, whereas, Respondents No.1 and 4 contend that the market value is
Rs.2,700/- per square foot. Contrary, Respondents No.2, 3 and 5 contend that the market value is
Rs.2,500/- per square foot. Arbitral Tribunal awarded the market value at the rate of Rs.4,000/- per
square feet.
63) Respondents' submission is that no reasons were assigned in coming to a conclusion regarding
the quantum of damages. It is contended that the Arbitral Tribunal merely reproduced the
submissions of the parties without referring the published market values or any other documents.
64) In para-45 of the award, the Arbitral Tribunal held as follows :
"45. Having regard to the submission made by both the sides and since there is no
conclusive proof regarding market value, I am of the opinion that the ends of justice
will be met if I award the same at Rs.4,000/- per Sq.Ft. as market value of the built
up area of 31,997 Sq.Ft."
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014
65) Before coming to such conclusion, the Arbitral Tribunal has taken into
consideration various factors as canvassed by the Claimant.
Factors taken into consideration by the Arbitral Tribunal have been mentioned in
para-43 of the award. Be that as it may. Respondents contend that no reference was
made to published market values or any other documents, while awarding market
value. Whether they had actually produced such documents before the Arbitral
Tribunal is a moot question? It is to be noted that no such documents have been
brought to the notice of Court. Had they produced the documents to show the actual
market value and the Arbitral Tribunal had not considered it, then, the matter would
have been different. In that circumstance, the Arbitral Tribunal, having regard to the
submissions of the parties, awarded the market value at the rate of 4,000/- per
square foot, which is neither on the higher side as contended by Claimant nor on the
lower side as submitted by Respondents. In view of absence of AS.08/2014 &
AS.37/2014 materials to substantiate the market value as contended by Respondents,
there is no reason to interfere with the plausible view of the Arbitral Tribunal in
arriving at its conclusion regarding the market value having regard to the various
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/119121776/ 20) M/S.Oikos Renaissance vs ) M/S.Aum Builders on 18 December, 2020
factors mentioned in the award.
66) Respondents contend that the Arbitral Tribunal has failed to set forth any reasons when
addressing the Issue No.11 and hence, the award is violative of Section 31(3) of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 and same is illegal, dehors the mandatory procedure of law, patently illegal
and liable to be set aside.
67) Claimant submits that reasons for rejecting Counter Claims and allowing the Claim are
interlinked.
68) It is to be noted that Respondents 2, 3 and 5 made a Counter Claim of Rs.191,50,00,000/- and
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 Respondents No.1 and 4 made a Counter Claim of Rs.40,02,00,000/-
against Claimant, contending that delay is caused by Claimant.
69) No where in the award, the Arbitral Tribunal came to the conclusion that at the instance of
Claimant the construction was delayed. On the other hand, the Arbitral Tribunal held that
construction of the project has not been commenced by Respondents. In that background, the
Arbitral Tribunal held that there are no merits in the Counter Claims. In that context rejection of
Counter Claims is to be looked into. When the entire Claim of the Claimant has been decided on
merits and award is based on reasons, then, there cannot be any reason to say that reasons assigned
for awarding the claim of Plaintiff cannot be made applicable to the Counter Claims made by
Respondents.
70) Respondents 2, 3, 5 and 6 have taken the contention that Respondent No.6 is not a party to
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 the arbitration agreement and Respondent No.6 has been saddled with
unwarranted liability. Arbitral Tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction in passing an award against
Respondent No.6, therefore, award is liable to be set aside. Reliance has been placed on Yogi
Agarwal vs. Inspiration Clothes & U, [(2009) 1 SCC 372] and Deutsche Post Bank Home Finance Ltd
vs. Taduri Sidhar & Anr., [(2011) 11 SCC 375].
71) The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Yogi Agarwal case (supra) was pleased to hold as follows :
"10. When Sections 7 and 8 of the Act refer to the existence of an arbitration
agreement between the parties, they necessarily refer to an arbitration agreement in
regard to the current dispute between the parties or the subject-matter of the suit. It
is fundamental that a provision for arbitration, to constitute an arbitration agreement
for the purposes of Sections 7 and 8 of the Act, should satisfy two conditions. Firstly,
it should be between the parties to the dispute. Secondly, it should relate to or be
applicable to the dispute."
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014
72) Similarly, in Deutsche Post Bank Home Finance Ltd case (supra), the Hon'ble
Supreme Court was pleased to reiterate the same principles laid in Yogi Agarwal case.

73) Section 2(h) of the Arbitration and conciliation Act, 1996 envisages the meaning
of the 'party'. It states that 'party' means a party to an arbitration agreement.
74) The question that looms the matter is that whether the case of Respondent No.6 comes under
the principles laid down in the above judgments.
75) To assail this question, it is necessary to have regard to the award. Relevant portion of the award
reads thus :
"4. ..... When the matter was posted for reply argument, on behalf of the claimant, an
application has been filed by the Claimant under Order 1 Rule 10(2) of the CPC to
implead Renaissance Real Asset Developers India LLP as Respondent No.6. Along
with the said application Claimant also produced two documents which were marked
by the consent of both the sides. Respondents have filed two separate AS.08/2014 &
AS.37/2014 objection statements opposing the said application. After hearing all the
parties, the said application was allowed by a separate order bringing Renaissance
Real Asset Developer India LLP on record as Respondent No.6. Advocate who is
representing Respondent Nos.2, 3 & 5 is representing Respondent No.6 also. After
Respondent No.6 is impleaded I heard all the parties again and they concluded their
arguments. ......"
"40. .... We should not forget the fact that during the pendency of these proceedings,
the construction work has been entrusted to Respondent No.6 who has been brought
on record subsequently. ......."
76) Arbitral Tribunal has specifically held that, during the arbitration proceedings, Respondents
No.1 and 2 entrusted the work to 6th Defendant. It means that Respondent No.6 stepped into shoes
of 2nd Respondent, who entered into MoU with Respondent No.1. Moreover, Agreement of Sale
makes it clear that Respondent No.2 has been arrayed as 'consenting party'. It has been mentioned
in the Agreement of Sale that the expression 'consenting party' shall include its associates from time
to time, successor in title.
AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014
77) The Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka in R.K. Associates vs. Channappa, [(1992) SCC OnLine Kar
152], was pleased to hold that "it is well laid principle of law that an arbitration clause is assignable,
if the main contract is assignable. Russel on Arbitration Nineteenth Edition, at page 69 has stated
that an arbitration agreement will bind not only the actual parties to it, but also an assignee of the
contract containing it."
78) In the instant case, there is no denial before the Arbitral Tribunal that no work has been
assigned to 6th Defendant. After impleadment of 6th Respondent, matter was heard afresh and
award was passed. Before this Court also, it is not at all the case of Respondents that they did not
entrust the work to 6th Respondent. Their only contention is that there exists no arbitration

agreement between the Claimant and 6th Respondent. 6th Respondent's impleadment has to be
viewed in the context of assignment of work to him by 2 nd Respondent. In AS.08/2014 &
AS.37/2014 that view, there is no reason to hold that Arbitral Tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction
in passing the award against 6th Respondent.
79) Thus, it is crystal clear from the award that the view expressed by the Arbitral Tribunal is a
plausible view. No arbitrariness or capriciousness is inferred from the award. Award is passed in
accordance with substantive law as provided and within the purview of the contract. Award can be
set aside for the grounds stated in Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. No such
grounds are made out by Respondents, muss-less the grounds mentioned in plaints and written
arguments; accordingly, I answer the above point in the negative and proceed to pass the following :
ORDER (1) Suits filed by Plaintiffs in A.S No.08/2014 and A.S No.37/2014 under
Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 to set aside the award dated
23.11.2013 AS.08/2014 & AS.37/2014 passed in CMP No.126/2008, are hereby
dismissed.
(2) No order as to costs.
(3) Keep the Original of this
judgment in AS.No.08/2014 and
copy in AS.No.37/2014.
(Dictated to the Judgment Writer directly on computer, typed matter corrected and
then pronounced by me in open court, on this the 18th day of December, 2020.)
