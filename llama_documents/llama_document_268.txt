O R D E R
Even though, the interim application is listed before me, by consent, the Writ Petition itself is taken
up for final hearing.
2.The following questions of law arise for consideration in this Writ Petition:
(i) Whether a registered Settlement Deed executed by a Mahomedan father in favour
of his son can be permitted to be revoked by a subsequent registration of a
Cancellation Deed under the Registration Act, 1908.
(ii) Is the registering authority bound to register the Cancellation Deed or can go into
the validity of the said document vis-a-vis the Settlement Deed and the applicability
of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat).
(iii) When the registering authority registers such a Deed of Cancellation, can this
Court go into the same and declare the registration as null and void by considering
the provisions of the Registration Act, 1908; Mahomedan Law; Transfer of Property
Act, 1882; Indian Evidence Act, 1872 as well as the averments contained in the deeds
while exercising the discretionary and extraordinary power under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India.
3.Heard Shri.K.M.Vijayan, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner and
Shri.I.Arokiasamy, learned Government Advocate appearing for first respondent as well as
Shri.V.Lakshminarayanan, learned counsel appearing for the respondents 2 and 3 and perused the
entire materials available on record.
Facts in brief:
4.The petitioner and the second respondent are son and father being Mahomedans governed by the
Muslim Personal Law (Shariat). A registered Settlement Deed was executed by the second
respondent in favour of the petitioner by way of a gift of a portion of the property, in which, the
second respondent is living. The Settlement Deed was executed on 11.08.2004 by the second
respondent. Thereafter, the second respondent unilaterally revoked the Settlement Deed on
18.07.2011 by way of a Cancellation Deed and consequentially conveyed the very same property in
favour of his grandson, namely, the third respondent on 22.07.2011. Aggrieved by the registration of
the Cancellation Deed and seeking to set aside the same, the present Writ Petition has been filed.
Submissions of the learned counsel for the petitioner:
5.Shri.K.M.Vijayan, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that what has
been registered is a Settlement Deed and such a deed requires a registration under Section 17 of the
Registration Act, 1908. Section 48 of the Registration Act, 1908, imposes fetters on any oral
agreement or declaration contrary to the registered document. When a Settlement Deed has been
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88482064/ 2S.M.Syed Mohammed Buhari vs The Sub Registrar on 9 December, 2011
registered, the title passes on to the settlee. Therefore, in the absence of any title, the settlor cannot
unilaterally cancel such a document which is impermissible in law. When once the parties come
under the purview of the Registration Act, 1908, the provisions of the said Act alone would govern.
In other words, the Personal Law, namely, Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) will not have any bearing
on such a transaction as against the provisions of the Registration Act, 1908. Even assuming the
Mahomedan Law is applicable, under Section 167(4) once possession is delivered, a settlement
cannot be revoked except by a decree of the Court. In view of the specific averment in the deed of
settlement regarding possession, the first respondent ought not to have registered the document. A
document reduced in writing requires compulsory registration notwithstanding the Personal Law.
The learned senior counsel has also made reliance upon Section 2(24) of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899
and submitted that when once a deed of settlement is executed then the provision of the said Act
alone would be made applicable. Therefore, the learned senior counsel submitted that the Writ
Petition will have to be allowed. In support of his contentions, the learned senior counsel has made
reliance upon the following judgments:
"S.GANESAN vs. BHARATHIRAJAN [2009 (5) CTC 558] ISMAIL GANI vs. MAIM
PONN PATTU BEEVI [1998 (I) CTC 735] ASOKAN vs. LAKSHMIKUTTY AND
OTHERS [(2007) 13 SCC 210] LATIF ESTATE LINE INDIA LTD. vs. HADEEJA
AMMAL & OTHERS [2011 (2) C.L.T.658]"
Submissions of the learned counsel for the respondents:
6.Shri.V.Lakshminarayanan, learned counsel appearing for the respondents 2 and 3 submitted that
Section 2 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 clearly mandates that Chapter-II would not affect
any rule of Mahomedan Law. The provisions of the Registration Act, 1908 are procedural in nature.
Therefore, they cannot be pitted against the Personal Law. While it can be said that a document
reduced in writing requires registration, the law governing the Mahomedans will have to be applied
in all force. The provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 particularly with reference to
Chapter-VII would not apply to the Mahomedan Law as stipulated under Section 129. The mere fact
that the document makes a mention about the possession would raise a mere presumption which
can be rebutted before the Court of law.
7.The petitioner seeks to convert the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India into that of a Civil Court. The ratio laid down by the Honourable Full Bench of
this Court does not apply to the case on hand dealing with a settlement under the Mahomedan Law.
In order to make a gift valid, the three essentials of a gift as stipulated under Section 149 of the
Mahomedan Law will have to be satisfied. The provisions contained under the Registration Act,
1908, particularly Section 48 is subject to the Personal Law governing the petitioner and the
respondents 2 and 3. In support of his contentions, the learned counsel has relied upon the
following judgments:
"IFTIKHAR WALI KHAN AND OTHERS vs. SIKANDAR BEGAM AND ANOTHER

[AIR 1963 ALLAHABAD 469] MT. BIBI MANIRAN vs. MOHAMMAD ISHAQUE

OTHERS vs. MANAHAPARA CHARAYIL [AIR 1972 KERALA 27] NASIB ALI vs.
WAJED ALI [AIR 1927 CAL 197]"
Analysis:
8.In order to appreciate the submissions made by the learned counsels on both sides, it is
imperative that this Court will have to make a visit to the various provisions of the enactments, more
particularly the Mahomedan Law; the Transfer of Property Act, 1882; Registration Act, 1908; and
Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
Mahomedan Law:
9.The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act (26 of 1937) came into existence on
07.10.1937. The clear prescription of the said Act is that in a case of gift involving a donor and donee
being Muslims, the law applicable to them shall be the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat). Section 2 of
the said Act is extracted herein for better appreciation:
"2.Application of Personal Law to Muslims.- Notwithstanding any customs or usage
to the contrary, in all questions (save questions relating to agricultural land)
regarding intestate succession, special property of females, including personal
property inherited or obtained under contract or gift or any other provision of
Personal Law, marriage, dissolution of marriage, including talaq, ila, zihar, lian,
khula and mubaraat, maintenance, dower, guardianship, gifts, trusts and trust
properties, and wakfs (other than charities and charitable institutions and charitable
and religion endowments) the rule of decision in cases where the parties are Muslims
shall be the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat)."
10.Chapter-XI of the Mahomedan Law deals with a hiba or a gift. Section 147 of the Mahomedan
Law stipulates that writing is not essential to the validity of a gift either of a movable or immovable
property. Under Section 149 of the Mahomedan Law, the prescription of a valid gift are as follows:
"149...... (1) a declaration of gift by the donor, (2) an acceptance of the gift, express or
implied, by or on behalf of the donee, and (3) delivery of possession of the subject of
the gift by the donor to the donee as mentioned in Section 150."
11.Section 150 of the Mahomedan Law deals with the delivery of possession. Section 150(2)
specifically states that a registration of a deed of gift does not cure the want of delivery of
possession. Therefore, the mandate of Section 150 of the Mahomedan Law is very clear that in order
to make a gift valid the factum of delivery of possession is a sine qua non which cannot be dispensed
with notwithstanding its registration. Section 152 of the Mahomedan Law stipulates that the donor
has to physically depart from the premises and the donee will have to formally enter into possession.
Section 167 of the Mahomedan Law speaks about the revocation of gifts before the delivery of
possession meaning thereby the gift would not be completed without possession. It is pertinent to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88482064/ 4S.M.Syed Mohammed Buhari vs The Sub Registrar on 9 December, 2011
note that Section 167(4) of the Mahomedan Law mandates that once possession is delivered, the gift
would become final and therefore, it cannot be revoked except by a decree of Court.
12.The above said provisions governing the Muslim Personal Law dealing with gift would in clear
terms exemplify the position that for a valid gift the three essentials contained under Section 149 of
the Mahomedan Law will have to be complied with. A mere registration by itself would not be a
substitute for a delivery of possession. Therefore, emphasis has been made in those provisions
dealing with gift coming under Chapter-XI of the Mahomedan Law to the factum of evidencing
actual and physical position. Now this assumes utmost significance. The question as to whether the
possession has been given or not is a question of fact to be proved before a Civil Court having the
territorial jurisdiction. When Section 167(4) of the Mahomedan Law specifically mandates that once
possession is delivered a gift cannot be revoked except by a decree of Court, the delivery of
possession assumes greater importance. Section 152(1) of the Mahomedan Law, as discussed above
also reimposes the said possession to the effect that the donor will have to physically depart from
the premises. Therefore, until the possession is handed over and proved by facts, a gift under the
Mahomedan Law has no existence, giving any right to the donee. On the contrary if the factum of
possession is admitted then the donee has no other option except to approach the Civil Court and
get a decree to revoke the gift.
13.Hence in the light of the analysis of the provisions of the Mahomedan Law, this Court is of the
view that the factum of possession being a disputed question of fact to be established before a
competent Civil Court, this Court cannot embark upon the said exercise merely based upon a recital
contained in the document which at the most would give a presumption against the donor which can
be rebutted by other forms of evidence.
Provisions of the Registration Act, 1908:
14.The Registration Act, 1908 substantially deals with the procedural law. The object of the
Registration Act, 1908, has been succinctly putforth by the Honourable Apex Court in SURAJ LAMP
& INDUSTRIES (P) LTD. vs. STATE OF HARAYANA [(2009) 7 SCC 363]. The following passage is
apposite:
"18.Registration provides safety and security to transactions relating to immovable
property, even if the document is lost or destroyed. It gives publicity and public
exposure to documents thereby preventing forgeries and frauds in regard to
transactions and execution of documents. Registration provides information to
people who may deal with a property, as to the nature and extent of the rights which
persons may have, affecting that property. In other words, it enables people to find
out whether any particular property with which they are concerned, has been
subjected to any legal obligation or liability and who is or are the person(s) presently
having right, title, and interest in the property. It gives solemnity of form and
perpetuate documents which are of legal importance or relevance by recording them,
where people may see the record and enquire and ascertain what the particulars are
and as far as land is concerned what obligations exist with regard to them. It ensures
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88482064/ 5S.M.Syed Mohammed Buhari vs The Sub Registrar on 9 December, 2011
that every person dealing with immovable property can rely with confidence upon the
statements contained in the registers (maintained under the said Act) as a full and
complete account of all transactions by which the title to the property may be affected
and secure extracts/copies duly certified."
15.Now let us have a relook at various provisions of the Act. Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908
speaks about the documents of which registration is compulsory. Section 48 of the Registration Act,
1908 deals with the effect of registration, according to which a registered document shall take effect
against any oral agreement or declaration. Section 49 of the Registration Act, 1908 deals with the
effect of non-registration of documents which is compulsorily registrable under Section 17 of the
Act.
16.Under Part-XII of the Registration Act, 1908, a registering authority can refuse to register.
However, while refusing to register a registering authority will have to assign reasons. Rules have
been framed by the State of Tamil Nadu in exercise of the rule making power conferred under
Section 16 of the Registration Act, 1908. A perusal of Rule 55 of the Registration Rules, would show
that a registering authority can make an enquiry before registration. The said rule also prescribes
the powers of the registering authority to enquire into the matters. The said rule is extracted herein
for better appreciation of the issues involved:
"55.It forms no part of a registering officer's duty to enquire into the validity of a
document brought to him for registration or to attend to any written or verbal protest
against the registration of a document based on the ground that the executing party
had no right to execute the document; but he is bound to consider objections raised
on any of the grounds stated below:-
(a) that the parties appearing or about to appear before him are not the persons they
profess to be;
(b) that the document is forged;
(c) that the person appearing as a representative, assign or agent, has no right to
appear in that capacity;
(d) that the executing party is not really dead, as alleged by the party applying for
registration; or
(e) that the executing party is a minor or an idiot or a lunatic."
17.Therefore, under Rule 55 of the Registration Rules, a registering authority will have the power to
enquire and consider the objections mentioned therein alone. A combined reading of Part-XII of the
Registration Act, 1908 and Rule 55 of the Registration Rules would lead to the irresistible
conclusion that the powers of the registering authority are circumscribed by the provisions.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88482064/ 6S.M.Syed Mohammed Buhari vs The Sub Registrar on 9 December, 2011
18.Rule 162(A) of the Registration Rules, deals with the duty of the registering authority in accepting
the document for registration. According to the said rule, a registering authority shall not accept for
registration any document or service agreement evidencing bonded labour or transaction
constituting an offence under any law or opposed to public policy or morality. Therefore, except the
above mentioned contingencies, the registering authority has got no other power but to accept the
document for registration.
19.The above said provisions contained under the Registration Act, 1908 and the Registration Rules
would make clear the role of the registering authority. The Act and Rules put fetters on the powers
of the registering authority. In other words, it is not open to the registering authority who is
supposed to act under the provisions of the law to go into the question as to whether a deed of
cancellation is correct or not. Such an authority also cannot go into the averments made in a
document as against the other materials evidence and the applicability of the Muslim Personal Law.
The provisions narrated above would make this position rather clear.
Provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882:
20.Section 2 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 states that Chapter-II which deals with the act of
parties would not affect any rule of Mahomedan Law. Therefore, when Section 147 of the
Mahomedan Law validates a oral gift, the same would not come into the purview of the transfer of a
immovable property in the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 under which a transfer without
registration is not valid apart from being inadmissible in law. Section 9 under Chapter-II deals with
an oral transfer. Accordingly, a transfer of property may be made without writing in a case where the
same is not expressly required by law. Chapter-VII deals with gifts. Section 129 of the Act prescribes
that the Chapter dealing with gifts would not affect any rule of Mahomedan Law.
21.Reading together Sections 2, 9 and 129 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 along with the
provisions of the Mahomedan Law, the emerging legal position would be that the provisions the
Transfer of Property Act, 1882 have no application to the conditions of a valid gift governed by the
Mahomedan Law. While it can be said that a document reduced in writing requires registration
under Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908, the question as to whether a gift is valid or not can
only be tested on the touch stone of the provisions of the Mahomedan Law alone. In other words, a
document reduced in writing concerned with the donor and donee being Mahomedans can be stated
to be compulsorily registrable, nonetheless the validity of a valid gift would be governed only by the
Mahomedan Law and not the Transfer of Property Act, 1882.
Combined effect of the enactments:
22.As a constitutional Court dealing with the interpretation, application and validity of the various
provisions of different enactments, this Court will have to adopt a harmonious construction
permitting the said enactments to travel in their own streams. When a conflict has not been
contemplated and the enactments are operating in their own respective fields, a Court of law cannot
create any. As discussed above, the Registration Act, 1908 deals with a registration based upon
public policy and the Mahomedan Law deals with Personal Law governing Mahomedans. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88482064/ 7S.M.Syed Mohammed Buhari vs The Sub Registrar on 9 December, 2011
Transfer of Property Act, 1882 excludes the provisions of the Mahomedan Law. Therefore, when the
very enactment itself makes it very clear about avoiding any possible conflict, this Court cannot
adopt an interpretation that would result in an artificial conflict which has never been the intention
of the legislation.
Role of the registering authority:
23.Now, we are primarily concerned with the role of the registering authority. The question whether
any public duty is imposed on the said authority while registering the cancellation documents. As
discussed above, under the provisions of the Registration Act, 1908 and the Registration Rules,
there is nothing that mandates the registering authority to go into the other aspects. It is to be seen
that we are not dealing with the case of a sale which by itself transfers title in pursuance to the
execution. It is not as if the case on hand comes under the provisions of Sections 71 to 76 of the
Registration Act, 1908 read with Rule 55 and 162(A) of the Registration Rules. When once the
registering authority cannot go into the other aspects, he cannot object to the registration of the
Cancellation Deed. The registration is an act of an Officer appointed by law and a cancellation of a
settlement is under the Mahomedan Law. In the case of a settlement deed it does not depend upon
consent. The registering officer is not duty bound to see the recitals of a document. It is also not
incumbent upon the said authority to look into the attending circumstances.
24.It is to be seen that a oral gift by a Mahomedan is valid in law subject to the satisfaction of the
other provisions contained in the Mahomedan Law. Therefore while an oral gift will have to be
tested under the Muslim Personal Law, merely because the registration is done as the document has
been reduced in writing, can it be said that the Muslim Personal Law would not be applicable to
such a case? The answer has to be in the negative. A registration places a document in the public
domine, therefore it does not efface the rights and liabilities governed under the Personal Law of a
Muslim. In other words, a registered gift deed under the Mahomedan Law is nothing but a piece of
evidence subject to the satisfaction of the other provisions contained therein. Hence, this Court is of
the view that there is no obligation in the nature of a public duty cast upon the first respondent to
refuse the registration.
Power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India:
25.As discussed above, when the registering authority does not have a statutory duty in refusing
registration of a Settlement Deed governed by the Muslim Personal Law, this Court cannot exercise
its power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. It is trite law that a Writ of Declaration can
only be issued, when a statutory duty has been wrongly exercised or done without authority. The
issue can be looked into from a different angle as well. As discussed above, the question of
admissibility or relevancy of the recital in a document and the factum of possession resulting in the
consequential conclusion of a valid gift is under the realm of a Civil Court having competent
jurisdiction. Hence, this Court cannot arrogate itself to the position of a Civil Court. The question as
to whether the presumption has been dispelled, possession has been handed over and the gift is
accepted or not cannot be gone into by this Court as well as the registering authority. In other
words, what the petitioner seeks before this Court is a declaration that the Cancellation Deed is null
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88482064/ 8S.M.Syed Mohammed Buhari vs The Sub Registrar on 9 December, 2011
and void which cannot be granted. This Court also does not find the action of the first respondent as
one without jurisdiction, power or authority. Therefore, the only remedy open to the petitioner is to
approach the Civil Court or he can ignore the Cancellation Deed, if in his opinion the earlier deed
has been given effect to under the Muslim Personal Law.
Analysis of the decisions:
26.Now coming to the decisions relied upon by the learned counsels appearing on both sides. Much
reliance has been made on the judgment of the Honourable Full Bench of this Court in LATIF
ESTATE LINE INDIA LTD. vs. HADEEJA AMMAL & OTHERS [2011 (2) C.L.T.658]. The issue
involved in the said decision is totally different. The Honourable Full Bench of this Court was
dealing with a sale. A sale simplicitor once effected by the parties would transfer the title
automatically. Such a sale deed is executed by both sides. Therefore considering the said position, it
was held by the Honourable Full Bench of this Court that inasmuch as the title of the property is
vested to the transferee, the same cannot be divested by the unilateral act of the transferor.
Admittedly, the Honourable Full Bench of this Court has not taken into consideration of the case of
a Settlement Deed even though the observation of the learned Single Judge of this Court was
quoted, in which, it has been stated that a settlement being unilateral stands on a different footing.
As discussed above, in the present case on hand, the question whether the gift has been effected or
not is a question of fact and there is no transfer of title by the operation of law as in the case of a
sale. Therefore, the reliance made by the learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner on the
decision of the Honourable Full Bench of this Court cannot be accepted.
27.The learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner has made reliance upon the judgment
rendered by this Court in ISMAIL GANI vs. MAIM PONN PATTU BEEVI [1998 (I) CTC 735] and the
judgment of the Honourable Apex Court in ASOKAN vs. LAKSHMIKUTTY AND OTHERS [(2007)
13 SCC 210]. These judgments are not applicable to the case on hand, as they have been rendered on
a appreciation of the evidence available on record by way of an adjudication through the Civil
Courts. The evidentiary value of a registered document particularly with reference to Sections 91, 92
and 114 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 is the role of the Civil Court. However, what we are dealing,
is the applicability of the conditions of a valid gift under the Mahomedan Law. As discussed above, a
registration being a part of procedural law cannot take away the rights and liabilities imposed by
way of conditions under a substantive law. Similarly, the decision rendered in S.GANESAN vs.
BHARATHIRAJAN [2009 (5) CTC 558] is also of no help as the said case arose from the suit that
too not dealing with the Muslim Personal Law. Moreover, in the judgments referred above, the
applicability of the Shariat Law has not been considered.
28.The learned counsel appearing for the respondents has also made reliance upon the judgment of
the Kerala High Court in MAKKU RAWTHER'S CHILDREN: ASSAN RAVTHER AND OTHERS vs.
MANAHAPARA CHARAYIL [AIR 1972 KERALA 27]. The decision of the Kerala High Court was
taken into consideration by this Court in a subsequent pronouncement in AMIRKHAN vs. GHOUSE
KHAN [(1985) 2 MLJ 136] wherein, it has been held that when a gift deed is reduced in writing even
among Mahomedans then the same is required to be registered under the provisions of the
Registration Act, 1908. The said decision has no relevancy and application to the present case as the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/88482064/ 9S.M.Syed Mohammed Buhari vs The Sub Registrar on 9 December, 2011
gift deed is registered voluntarily. Section 129 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 recognizes the
applicability of the rule of Mahomedan Law which would include the conditions for a valid gift. The
word "rule" would necessarily mean the conditions of a valid gift. Further the Court was only
concerned with the admissibility of an unregistered gift deed. The question for consideration in the
present case is not as to whether a gift deed reduced in writing required registration or not but
whether the Muslim Personal Law governing the Mahomedans would cease to apply by an act of
Registration. In fact, this Court was pleased to hold in the said case that the very purpose of 129 of
the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 is to avoid any friction. Section 123 of the Transfer of Property
Act, 1882 and the Muslim Personal Law relating to Mahomedans.
29.In so far as the ratio laid down in MAKKU RAWTHER'S CHILDREN: ASSAN RAVTHER AND
OTHERS vs. MANAHAPARA CHARAYIL [AIR 1972 KERALA 27] is concerned, the following
passage is apposite:
"8......A Muslim gift may be valid even without a registered deed and may be invalid
even with a registered deed....."
The said observation of the Kerala High Court in fact supports the case of the respondents that a
mere registration by itself would not validate a gift under the Mahomedan Law.
30.Let us analyse the issue by taking into consideration of a deed of mortgage by conditional sale as
stipulated under Section 58(c) of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. In a subsequent document
executed, can the registering authority go into issue of compliance of the conditions imposed in the
earlier document. This Court is afraid that such a course is not possible. In such an event it is open
to a party to execute another deed on the ground that the conditions agreed in the earlier document
are not complied with by the other party. Hence when a document can be executed subsequently on
the alleged compliance or non-compliance of the conditions mentioned in the earlier document, it
cannot be said that condition imposed by way of substantive law cannot be sought to be invoked by
an act of subsequent cancellation. In other words when a conditional sale does not take away the
rights of the parties notwithstanding the registration in view of the agreement between them, it can
very well be said that such a registration would not affect the conditions imposed by law.
31.Therefore as discussed above, the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and the Registration Act, 1908
on the one hand and the Mahomedan Law on the other hand will have to be read together being
complementary to each other. By applying the said principle, the irresistible conclusion would be
that even among Muslims when a gift is reduced in writing and registered, such an act of
registration would not remove and take away the applicability of the provisions of Mahomedan Law
by which conditions have been imposed for a valid gift. By holding so in effect would not only
destroy the provisions of the Mahomedan Law but also the protection given under the Transfer of
Property Act, 1882 as well.
32.In fine, this Court is of the considered view that the Writ Petition will have to be dismissed and
accordingly, the same is dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs. Consequently, connected
miscellaneous petition is closed.
