COMMON ORDER
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 The Civil Revision Petition in
C.R.P.No.587 of 2022 has been preferred to set aside the order passed by the learned XVI Small
Causes Court, Chennai in M.P.No.1 of 2021 in RLTOP No.420 of 2020 dated 31.01.2022.
2. The Civil Revision Petition in C.R.P.No.1937 of 2022 has been preferred to set aside the order and
decree passed in RLTOP SR.No.694 of 2022 dated 18.04.2022, on the file of the X Small Causes

3. Heard Mr.Anirudh Krishnan and Mr.M.Sunil Kumar, learned counsels for the petitioners in both
Civil Revision Petitions and Mr.M.L.Ganesh, learned counsel for the respondent in C.R.P.No.587 of
2022 and also perused the materials placed on record.
4. The short facts of the case in C.R.P.No.587 of 2022 are as follows:
The revision petitioner claims himself as a tenant under the respondent/landlord.
T h e r e s p o n d e n t l a n d l o r d f i l e d a n e v i c t i o n p e t i t i o n i n
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 RLTOP.No.420 of
2020, for recovery of possession under the new Tamil Nadu Regulation of Rights and
Responsibilities of Landlords and Tenants Act, 2017 (Act 42 of 2017 as amended by
Act 39 of 2018). During the pendency of the said petition, a miscellaneous petition
was filed by the petitioner herein in M.P.No.1 of 2021, seeking to dismiss the eviction
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34909076/ 3M/S.Primex Healthcare And Research ... vs Mr.A.A.L.Ramaswamy on 29 September, 2022
petition as not maintainable, in view of the repugnancy between Section 5(3) of the
Act (Act 42 of 2017) and Section 116 of Transfer of Property Act (Act 4 of 1882). The
said petition was dismissed by the Rent Controller. Aggrieved over that, the tenant
has filed this Civil Revision Petition.
5. The short facts involved in the Miscellaneous Petition are as follows:
The revision petitioner is a Diagnostic Centre by name M/s.Primex Healthcare and
Research Private Limited which involves in providing medical services like scan and
other laboratory services. The petitioner Centre was established at the respondent's
premises on a rental basis. The terms of the rent was reduced into writing by virtue of
an agreement of lease dated 22.01.2011.
The monthly rent was agreed at Rs.5,41,000/-per month in the beginning and later it
was reduced to Rs.4,05,750/- per month. Owing to Covid-19 pandemic
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 and resultant lock
down, the petitioner suffered a rough phase. Hence he needed to shut down his
centre from 24.03.2020. However the petitioner has paid rent upto December 2020
in terms of the lease agreement. But the respondent had chosen to file a petition for
eviction on the ground of failure to enter into an agreement and wilful default in
payment of rent and parting with the possession of the property without obtaining a
written consent of the landlord. The petitioner was remitting the rent regularly and
that is being accepted by the respondent, the original lease agreement that was
entered into on 02.04.2018 was subsequently amended on 15.12.2019 by which the
rent was reduced from Rs.5,41,000/- to Rs.4,05,750/-. After the expiry of lease
agreement in December 2020, the petitioner continues to be in possession of the suit
property and the respondent has also accepted the same.
5.1. While Section 116 of Transfer of Property Act recognizes holding over of lease,
Section 5(3) of the New Act (Act 42 of 2017) prohibits holding over. Since the
Transfer of Property Act is a Central Act and the Tamil Nadu Regulation of Rights
and Responsibilities of Landlords and Tenants Act, 2017 is a State Act, there is
repugnancy between the State Act and the Central Act.
When there is repugnancy, the State Act which did not receive the presidential
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 assent, cannot prevail over the
Central Act. Hence the petition filed by the respondent for eviction should be dismissed as not
maintainable.
6. The respondent landlord has resisted the above application by stating that the Tamil Nadu
Regulation of Rights and Responsibilities of Landlords and Tenants Act, 2017 is a Special Act which
provides faster adjudication of the disputes between the landlord and the tenant and it has replaced
the Tamil Nadu buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1960. Section 40 of the New Act (Act 42 of
2017) bars the jurisdiction of the Civil Court for the dispute with regard to the tenancy agreement
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34909076/ 4M/S.Primex Healthcare And Research ... vs Mr.A.A.L.Ramaswamy on 29 September, 2022
between the landlord and the tenant. But the Special Act governs rights and responsibilities of the
landlord and tenant. Hence invoking Section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act does not arise. After
issuing legal notice on 17.10.2020, the respondent has filed an application by invoking Section
21(2)(a), 21(2)(b), 21(2)(c) of the Act. Hence the petitioner cannot invoke Section 116 of the Transfer
of Property Act for a proceedings pending before the Rent Control Court. The question of
repugnancy does not arise because Section 5(3) clearly spells out the status of tenant and the
landlord. While filing the petition for eviction under the Tenancy Act, there is no need to give notice
under Section 106 of Transfer of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022
Property Act. The applicability of the New Act or the existing Act ought to have been challenged by
the petitioner by way of filing a Writ Petition and not by way of filing a Miscellaneous Petition.
Hence the petition should be dismissed.
7. The learned Rent Controller has dismissed the petition by observing that the Rent Court has got
no power to decide about the validity of any Act or provision on the ground of repugnancy and that
the Rent Controller can exercise his power only within the bounds of the provisions of the Tamil
Nadu Regulation of Rights and Responsibilities of Land Lords and Tenants Act, 2017. Aggrieved
over the said order, the tenant has preferred the Civil Revision Petition in C.R.P.No.587 of 2022.
8. The short facts of the case in C.R.P.No.1937 of 2022 are as follows:
The revision petitioner/landlord is a society and it is being represented by its
honorary Secretary. The petitioner and one Sangvi entered into a lease agreement on
25.05.1968 for 55 years in respect of ‘B’ schedule of the agreement and it was
registered lease agreement and it was registered on https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 14.06.1968 at the Sub- Registrar office, Triplicane. The
subject matter of the above lease was subsequently assigned by Sangvi in favour of
the respondents 1 and 2 and respondents 3 to 11 claim tenancy rights under the
respondents 1 and 2. Since the building is in a dilapidated condition, the landlord has
filed a petition for eviction in RLTOP.SR.No.694 of 2022 under Section 21(2) (e) of
the Act. The said petition was rejected at the threshold on the observation that the
tenancy agreement was not registered with the Rent Authority as required under
Section 4(3) of the Act. Aggrieved over that, this Civil Revision Petition has been
preferred.
9. The grounds stated in the Revision Petition is that the petitioner had registered the tenancy
agreement even prior to commencing of the New Act and it has also been registered properly under
the Registration Act and hence there is no necessity to register the tenancy once again. The Rent
Court has wrongly interpreted Section 4(3) of the Tamil Nadu Regulation of Rights and
Responsibilities of Land Lords and Tenants Act, 2017 (for the sake of brevity TNRRRLT Act). Hence
the Central Act viz., The Transfer of Property Act mandates registration only if the rent agreement is
beyond eleven months. The classification laid down by this Court in the case of S.Muruganandam
Vs. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 J.Joseph in C.R.P.Nos.3056,
3061, 3062, 3063, 3067 and 3094 of 2021 dated 04.02.2022, is only illustrative and not exhaustive.
The case of the petitioner does not fall under the situations dealt in the said judgment. Hence the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34909076/ 5M/S.Primex Healthcare And Research ... vs Mr.A.A.L.Ramaswamy on 29 September, 2022
Rent Court ought not to have applied the findings of the said judgment to the facts of this case. Since
the statutory requirement has been complied in accordance with the situation prevailed in the year
1968, the Rent Court ought to have entertained the petition.
10. In view of the interconnection of many of the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Regulation of Rights
and Responsibilities of Land Lords and Tenants Act, 2017, while deciding the above revisions, I felt
it convenient to make a common discussion and decide the cases by a common order.
11. Now the following questions will arise for consideration:
1. Whether the petitioner/tenant in C.R.P.No.587 of 2022 is a tenant by holding over
under Section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act and for that reason whether the
eviction petition filed by the landlord under the New Act is not maintainable?
2. Whether the petitioner / landlord in C.R.P.No.1937 of 2022 can maintain an
Application for eviction under the New Act by https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 claiming that his 55 years lease agreement dated
25.05.1968, was registered under the registration Act and hence he is not obligatory
to comply Section 4(3) of the New Act?
12. The arguments of the respective counsels are in the line of their grounds raised in their
respective revision petition. The main thrust of the contentions of the parties are based upon the
impact of Section 4 and Section 5(3) of the New Tamil Nadu Regulation of Rights and
Responsibilities of Land Lords and Tenants Act, 2017 (Act 42 of 2017).
13. The object of the TNRRRLT Act is to establish a frame work for the regulation of rent and to
balance the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants and to provide faster adjudication
process for resolution of disputes, and matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.
14. The idea to bring the New legislation is to resolve tenancy issues in the line of Model Tenancy Act
and in response to the recommendation of the Government of India. In view of the New legislation
which came into effect from 22.02.2019, the old Tamil Nadu Buildings (Lease and Rent Control)
Act, 1960, got repealed.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022
15. The learned counsels frequently referred the recent judgment of this court made in
C.R.P.Nos.3056, 3061, 3062, 3063, 3067 & 3094 of 2021, in the case of S.Muruganandam Vs.
J.Joseph. In the above judgment Hon’ble Justice. R.Subramanian has held that in some of the
situations dealt in that case, the landlord cannot invoke the provisions of the New Act for eviction,
but will resort to general law and seek remedy for re-possession.
16. In S.Muruganandam Vs. J.Joseph, the following six contingencies have been dealt.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34909076/ 6M/S.Primex Healthcare And Research ... vs Mr.A.A.L.Ramaswamy on 29 September, 2022
“i. Written tenancy created prior to and expired prior to the commencement of the Act (Tenant
holding over under an oral tenancy);
ii. Oral tenancies created prior to the New Act and no written agreement entered into;
iii. Written tenancies created prior to the New Act and the period expired after the commencement
of the Act;
iv. Written tenancies entered after the commencement of the New Act not registered but subsisting;
v. Written tenancies created after the commencement of the New Act and had presently expired
(either registered or unregistered) vi. Oral tenancies created after the New Act.”
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022
17. It is held in the above judgment that the landlord would have the right to invoke Section 21(2)(a)
of the New Act in respect of contingencies 1 and 2 and all other clauses of Section 21(2) in respect of
third category for seeking eviction. In respect of 4th contingency the landlord has to seek eviction
only under Transfer of Property Act. In respect of 5th contingency, the landlord can invoke all
grounds under Section 21(2) except 21(2) (a), if the landlord files Application for eviction under the
New Act and if the landlord seeks eviction beyond 6 months he has to seek eviction only under the
Transfer of Property Act. In respect of the 6th contingency, the landlord has no other option except
seek eviction under the Transfer of property Act. Section 40 of the New Act which excludes the
jurisdiction of Civil Court was reconciled by placing reliance on the judgment of the Full Court held
in Periathambi Goundan Vs The District Revenue Officer, Coimbatore and others. (1980(2) MLJ
89).
18. I feel the applicability of the TNRRRLT Act can be viewed from some other angles also and the
various situations surrounding the disputes between landlord and tenant can be accommodated
before the Rent Court itself https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 to the
extent possible. Since fulcrum of regulations, revolutions, hurdles, limitations and differences
revolve around Sections 4 and 5(3) of the New Act, it is essential to reproduce and read the said
provisions segment by segment.
19. Section 4(1) of the New Act states that no person shall let or take on rent any premises except by
an agreement in writing. Since this revolutionary provision starts with a non-obstante clause, it tries
to make the oral tenancy obsolete, atleast under the Rent Law Jurisprudence. Since the substantive
law like Transfer of Property Act still recognizes oral lease for a period below one year and the
Central Law has the advantage of prevailing over the State law in case of repugnancy, it is reliably
learnt that this provision is said to be under challenge in a Writ Petition. If no such writ is filed so
far, it might happen sooner or later.
“Section 4(1):
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34909076/ 7M/S.Primex Healthcare And Research ... vs Mr.A.A.L.Ramaswamy on 29 September, 2022
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or any other law for the time being in
force, no person shall, after the commencement of this Act, let or take on rent any
premises except by an agreement in writing.”
20. As per Section 4(2), if no written agreement was entered into https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 between the landlord and the tenant in respect of the tenancies in
force before the commencement of the New Act, it shall be obligatory on the part of the parties to
enter into a written agreement within a period of 570 days from the date of commencement of the
New Act. The proviso to Section 4(2) would give right to both the landlord and tenant to terminate
the tenancy under Section 21(2)(a), if either of them fails to enter into a written agreement.
“Section 4(2):
Where, in relation to a tenancy created before the commencement of this Act, no
agreement in writing was entered into, the landlord and the tenant shall enter into an
agreement in writing with regard to that tenancy within a period of five hundred and
seventy five days from the date of commencement of this Act, Provided that where
the landlord or tenant, fails to enter into an agreement under this sub-Section , the
landlord or tenant shall have the right to apply for termination of the tenancy under
clause (a) of sub-Section (2) of Section 21.”
21. As per Section 4(3), the written tenancy agreement entered between
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 the parties either before or after the
commencement of the Act shall be registered with the Rent Authority by making an application.
“Section 4(3) - Every agreement referred to in sub-
Section(1) and sub-Section(2) and any tenancy agreement in writing already entered into before the
commencement of this Act, shall be registered with the Rent Authority by the landlord or tenant, by
making an application in the Form specified in the First Schedule within such time as may be
prescribed.”
22. Rule 3 of the Tamil Nadu Regulation of Rights and Responsibilities of Land Lords and Tenants
Rules, 2019, prescribes the time line for registration as under:
“(i) The tenancy agreement entered into between the parties after the
commencement of the Act shall be registered with the Rent Authority (before 22nd
day of August 2019 or within ninety days from the date of execution of such
agreement, whichever is later
(ii) Written Tenancy agreement created before the commencement of the Act as per
Section 4(2), within 90 days from the date of execution of the agreement.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34909076/ 8M/S.Primex Healthcare And Research ... vs Mr.A.A.L.Ramaswamy on 29 September, 2022
(iii) Written tenancy created before the commencement of the Act, the registration
shall be done within 570 days from the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 date of publication of the Rules in the Government
Gazette (i.e.) with effect from 22.02.2019.”
23. The impact of non- registration in accordance with Section 4(3) read with Rule 3 is stated under
Section 4-A as shown below.
“Section 4-A: Effect of non-registration No document required to be registered under sub-
Section (3) of Section 4 shall, unless it has been registered,-
(a) Affect any immovable property comprised therein, or
(b) Confer any power to adopt, or
(c) be received in evidence of any transaction affecting such property or conferring
any right.”
24. The above provision conveys that in the event of non-registration of a tenancy agreement, the
tenancy agreement shall not be received in evidence and hence it is difficult for the parties to an
unregistered tenancy agreement to claim the rights and safeguards available under the Act.
25. Before proceeding to Section 5(3), in view of the proviso to Section 4 (2), a birds eye-view about
Section 21 is necessary. As per Section 21(1), no tenant shall be evicted during the continuation of
the tenancy agreement. It is due the binding nature of contract rental agreement and and the
inviolability https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 of the contracts.
However, Section 21(2) would prescribe the grounds under which the tenant can be evicted during
the continuation of the contractual tenancy, except Section 21(1)(a).
26. If both the parties to a tenancy agreement agree to have a tenancy agreement for any specific
period they should get it written. If the landlord fails to come forward to enter into a written
agreement, the tenant can terminate the tenancy and vacate the premises any time before the expiry
of the agreed period of tenancy and the landlord cannot claim damages for such termination done at
the instance of the tenant. If the tenant does not come forward to execute a written agreement, then
the landlord can evict the tenant in accordance with Section 21(2)(a). Since the failure to execute the
written tenancy agreement itself a ground for eviction, the Rent Court cannot expect the landlord to
produce a written and registered tenancy agreement at the time of filing an Application for eviction.
It is to be noted that no time limit is prescribed either under the Act for filing a petition for eviction
by the landlord on the ground of absence of written tenancy agreement (Section 21(2)(a)).
27. To examine of Section 5 is very much essential to understand the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 impact of rent law on holding over.
For the purpose of convenience, the Section 5 is extracted as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34909076/ 9M/S.Primex Healthcare And Research ... vs Mr.A.A.L.Ramaswamy on 29 September, 2022
“Section 5: Period of tenancy (1) All tenancies entered into after the commencement
of this Act shall be for a period as agreed between the landlord and the tenant and as
specified in the tenancy agreement.
(2) The tenant may approach the landlord for renewal or extension of the tenancy,
within the period agreed to in the tenancy agreement, prior to the end of tenancy
period and if agreeable to the landlord may enter into a new tenancy agreement with
the landlord on mutually agreed terms and conditions.
(3) If a tenancy for a fixed term ends and has not been renewed or the premises have
not been vacated by the tenant and where the landlord has not demanded possession
of vacant premises at the end of such tenancy, the tenancy shall be deemed to be
renewed on a month-
to-month basis on the same terms and conditions as were in the expired tenancy agreement, for a
maximum period of six months.” https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022
28. In S. Muruganandam’s case it is held that a landlord who allows his tenant to hold over for more
than 6 months should file a suit for eviction under the common law. It has stemmed out from an
opinion that the tenant who is holding over for more than 6 months cannot be termed as ‘tenant’
and hence the relationship of landlord and tenant had ceased to exist. It is appropriate to extract the
relevant portion of the judgment as under:
“11. The next question that would arise is as to what is the status of such a tenant
after the expiry of the six months period, whether the landlord could seek eviction of
such a tenant under Section 21(2)(a) of the New Act. Proviso to Sub Section 2 of
Section 4 enables the landlord to seek eviction of a tenant on the ground of failure to
enter into an agreement only in respect of cases falling under Sub Section 2 of Section
4 and not otherwise. Therefore, it can be said that there is a vacuum or a lacuna
created by the Act in respect of eviction of certain classes of tenants and a
considerable doubt is also raised as to the remedy of the landlord to seek eviction of
such tenants.
12. In the light of the non obstante clause in sub Section (1) of Section 4, whether a
tenant who continues in possession after six months after expiry of the lease under
Sub Section (3) of Section 5 could be termed as a tenant holding over or as a
trespasser also looms large. The https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 &
1937 of 2022 landlord must have a remedy. The question that would arise is what is
the remedy that is available to the landlord whether he could terminate the tenancy
by issuing a notice of termination under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act
and seek ejectment or he should sue for recovery of possession treating the tenant as
a trespasser.

Various contingencies like the one above would crop up and the Rent Courts which are of very
limited jurisdiction would be called upon to decide these questions also.”
29. The term ‘tenant’ is defined under Section 2(n) of the New Act as under:
“Section 2 (n): “tenant” means a person by whom or on whose account or behalf the
rent of any premises is, or, but for a contract express or implied, would be payable for
any premises and includes any person occupying the premises as a sub-tenant and
also, any person continuing in possession after the termination of his tenancy
whether before or after the commencement of this Act; but shall not include any
person against whom any order or decree for eviction has been made.”
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022
30. A person who continues to be in possession after the termination of the tenancy whether before
or after the commencement of this Act, still falls under the definition of 'tenant'. The above
definition excludes explicitly only those persons against whom any order or decree for eviction has
been made. So the tenants who continue to hold over for more than 6 months from the date of
expiry of the agreement are still seen to be covered under the definition of ‘tenant’. Omitting the
category of those persons against whom any order or decree for eviction has been made has cured
the impact created under Section 10(1) of the old Tamil Nadu Buildings (lease and Rent Control) Act
1960. Under Section 10(1) of the Old Act, there was a prohibition to evict a tenant who suffered a
decree for eviction before the commencement of the Old Act. The definition of the tenant for the
New Act removes the said interdiction. In the case of our own High Court Mandhirikodi Vs
E.Balaraman, reported in 2020(4) CTC 659, Hon’ble. Justice.R. Subramanian has dealt the direct
reflection of Section 10(1) of the Old Act in a classic case and held as under:
“18. No doubt, Mr.V.Sesachari would contend that there is a interdict on execution of
the decree under the Tamilnadu Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act. But the said
interdict no longer survives in view of the fact that the very enactment namely, the
Tamilnadu Buildings (Lease and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 &
1937 of 2022 Rent Control) Act, 1960 has been repealed and the new Act has been
put in place. The new Act namely, the Tamilnadu Regulation of Rights and
Responsibilities of Landlords and Tenants Act, 2017 does not bar execution of a
decree obtained against a tenant, in view of the definition of tenant under the new
Act. I therefore conclude that the S.A.Nos. 100 & 101 of 2014 decree passed by the
Civil Court is executable in the changed scenario. In the absence of any provision in
the 2017 Act, I do not think the suit could be said to be barred and the decree could
be said to be invalid. I therefore, conclude that the decree passed in O.S.No.1061 of
2004 is valid and is executable.”
31. With regard to the status of parties to a tenancy agreement, subsequent to its expiry, it is
relevant to refer an important judgment of the full Bench of this Court held in Raval And Co. And
Anr. Vs. K.G. Ramachandran (Minor) And Ors. on 20 January, 1966, reported in (1966) 2 MLJ 68.
It was a matter on reference and in which 4 questions had emerged for consideration, which
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34909076/ 11M/S.Primex Healthcare And Research ... vs Mr.A.A.L.Ramaswamy on 29 September, 2022
included the constitutional validity of the Tamil Nadu Rent Control Act. The opening paragraph
Nos. 1 and 2 and the answering paragraph 44 of the above judgment is extracted as under for ready
reference:
“1. W.P. No. 1124 of 1963 comes before us on a Reference made by one of us (K.
Srinivasan, J.). It was a proceeding in Prohibition, of Messrs. Raval & Company
(petitioners), seeking to restrain the respondents, including
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 the Chief Rent
Controller, Madras (fourth respondent), from prosecuting or proceeding with a
petition for the fixation of fair rent, under the Madras Rent Control Acts. Connected
with this are two other proceedings, namely, C.R.P. No. 1816 of 1963 and Application
No. 2443 of 1964 in C. S. No. 163 of 1962, in which certain closely inter- linked
questions are involved. Our learned brother (Srinivasan, J.) felt the difficulty that the
catena of decisions of this Court, as far as the Madras Rent Control Acts are
concerned, had been only in the consistent directions that these Acts did purport to
interfere with contractual tenancies, both as regards the fixation1 of fair rents and as
regards the respective rights of landlords and tenants, in the matter of eviction and
the grounds for eviction; while certain recent decisions of the Supreme Court, no
doubt not upon the Madras Acts but upon similar enactments of other States, appear
to justify the interpretation that the contractual tenancies should first be terminated
by a notice under Section 111(h) of the Transfer of Property Act, after which alone the
procedure under the special Acts would become applicable, their object being to give
this additional protection to what are termed 'statutory tenancies '.
2. This explains the Reference, and, as the matter has been argued before us, the
following questions emerge for our https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587
& 1937 of 2022 consideration:
1. Do the Madras Act, including the latest Amending Act XI of 1964, enact as
self-contained Code governing all relationships between landlords and tenants,
during their subsistence, including contractual as well as statutory tenancies, within
their ambit ?
2. In particular, do they enable landlords and tenants to obtain the determination of
fair rents for buildings, even during contractual tenancies, and notwithstanding the
contract of rent, to which the tenancies relate ?
3. Similarly, do they enable the landlords and tenants to work out their respective
rights in the matter of the liability of the tenants for eviction on the grounds specified
in the Acts, even during a contractual tenancy, and without that tenancy being first
determined by the landlord in accordance with Section 111(h) of the Transfer of
Property Act ?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34909076/ 12M/S.Primex Healthcare And Research ... vs Mr.A.A.L.Ramaswamy on 29 September, 2022
4. Can this interpretation be sustained, as a matter of legislative competence and
legislative intendment, notwithstanding the absence of a non-obstante clause in the
Acts ?
44. In our view, therefore, the Reference must be answered in the terms that we have
indicated earlier. The Madras Rent Control Acts, viewed, from any perspective,
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 such as that of
legislative competence legislative intendment or the plain significance of the
structure of the enactments, admits only of one interpretation; they interfere both
with contractual and statutory tenancies, by affording a special protection to tenants
against eviction, and also balancing this by certain corresponding obligations
imposed on tenants. For this reason, the determination of a contractual tenancy by
notice under the Transfer of Property Act is not essential for the Landlord to obtain
eviction on the grounds specified in Section 10, as those are the very terms of the
protection afforded to tenants, even after the determination of tenancies. The Act is a
complete Code for Tribunals exercising this jurisdiction for the execution of the
orders of such Tribunals, and for appeal and revision. The absence of a non obstante
clause does not affect the interpretation of the Act' with regard to the inroads it
makes upon the previous property law of landlords and tenants of buildings. Equally,
it enables both landlords and tenants to seek the benefit of the fixation of fair rent,
under its provisions, and by the special machinery provided, whether a contractual
tenancy with different terms prevails, or it has been determined. The Acts are within
the competence of the Legislature and validly passed, including Act XI of 1964. None
of them is liable to be struck https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937
of 2022 down, either on the ground of hostile discrimination under Article 14, or on
the ground that there has been an unreasonable restriction of fundamental rights
guaranteed under Article 19(1)(f) of the Constitution.”
32. The above judgment was challenged before the Supreme Court, on Appeal and it
was placed before a constitutional bench. The Constitutional bench of Supreme Court
per majority (3:2) had upheld the decision of the Full bench of the High Court. It is
worthwhile to extract the portion of the judgment of the Supreme Court held in Raval
& Co Vs. K. C. Ramachandran & Ors on 11 December, 1973 (1974 AIR 818, 1974 SCR
(2) 629) , as under.
“........We have already referred to the definition of the terms 'landlord' and 'tenant' which applies
both to subsisting tenancies as well as tenancies which might have come to an end. We may also
refer to the provision in Section 7(2) which lays down that where the fair rent of a building has not
been fixed the landlord shall not claim anything in addition to the agreed rent, thus showing that the
fair rent can be fixed even where there is an agreed rent. That is why we have earlier pointed out that
the various English decisions which provide for fixation of rent only where the contractual tenancy
has come to an end do not apply here. We may also refer to sub- Section (3) of Section 16 which
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 deals with cases where a landlord
requires a residential or non-residential building for his own use. Clause (d) of that sub-Section
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34909076/ 13M/S.Primex Healthcare And Research ... vs Mr.A.A.L.Ramaswamy on 29 September, 2022
provides that where the tenancy is for a term the landlord cannot get possession before the expiry of
the term, thus showing that in other cases of eviction covered by Section 10 eviction is permissible
even during the continuance of the contractual tenancy if the conditions laid down in Section 10 are
satisfied.
The Madras High Court reviewed all the decisions of this Court' except the latest one in Manujendra
v. Purendu Prosad. We have already pointed out that the criticism made in that decision regarding
Krishnamurthy's Case was not justified. We are in agreement with the view of the Full Bench of the
Madras High Court that the various decisions of this Court were based upon particular provisions of
the Acts, which were under consideration, mainly the Bombay Act which is vitally different from the
Madras Act. A close analysis of the Madras Act shows that it has a scheme of its own and it is
intended to provide a complete code in respect of both contractual tenancies as well as what are
popularly called statutory tenancies. As noticed earlier the definition of the term 'landlord' as well as
the term 'tenant' shows that the Act applies to contractual tenancies as well as cases of "statutory
tenants" and their landlords. On some supposed https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 &
1937 of 2022 general principles governing all Rent Acts it cannot be argued that such fixation can
only be for the benefit of the tenants when the Act clearly lays down that both landlords and tenants
can apply for fixation of fair rent. A close reading of the Act shows that the fair rent is fixed for the
building and it is payable by whoever is the tenant whether a contractual tenant. Or statutory
tenant. What is fixed is not the fair rent payable by the tenant or to the landlord who applies for
fixation of fair rent act fair rent for the building, something like an incident of the fair regarding the
building.”
33. The above judgment of the Supreme Court was followed by various decisions including the
judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in Bapalal And Co. Vs. P. Thakurdas And Ors. on 28
April, 1982 reported in ((1982) 2 MLJ 174). The said judgment was cited by the learned counsel for
the petitioner in C.R.P.587/2022 in support of his contentions. In the said case, the court had to
deal with the case where the plaintiff had challenged the constitutional validity of the Tamil Nadu
Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act 1960, by attacking the action of his landlord in filing
Applications before the Rent Court for fixation of fair rent and eviction on the ground of demolition
and reconstruction. It was argued on behalf of the plaintiff that providing
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 grounds for eviction during the
subsistence of the contractual tenancy in the Rent Control Act and thereby terminating a contractual
tenancy (even while it was subsisting) and converting it into a statutory tenancy is unconstitutional.
The following reliefs were sought by the plaintiff in the suit filed by him.
“(a) For declaring that the rights and liabilities between the plaintiffs as lessees and the defendants 1
to 7 as lessors are exclusively governed by the lease deed dated 26- 8-1977 and by the provisions of
the Transfer of Property Act. 1882;
(b) for declaring that the Rent Controller has no jurisdiction to entertain and Proceed with H. R. C.
Petitions Nos. 1146 and 1147 of 1979.

(c) for declaring that the Tamil Nadu Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act 1960 is wholly ultra
vires and void and restraining the State of Tamil Nadu by injunction from taking any action under
the Act or enforcing the provisions of the Act;
(d) for declaring that sub-clause (iii) in Section 30 of the Tamil Nadu Buildings (Lease and Rent
Control) Act 1960 exempting non-residential buildings with rent above Rs.400 per month inserted
by Tamil Nadu Act 2 of 1962 is in force notwithstanding the purported repeal thereof by Tamil Nadu
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 Act 11 of 1964.”
34. His lordship Ramanujam.J, as he then was and who wrote the judgment for the bench referred
the judgment of the Supreme Court in Raval’s case. As stated already, in Raval’s case the Supreme
Court confirmed the judgment of the Full bench of this court which upheld the constitutional
validity of the Rent Control Act. For an interesting insight and understanding, it is relevant to
extract the relevant portion of the judgment as below:
Bapalal And Co. Vs. P. Thakurdas And Ors. on 28 April, 1982. (AIR 1982 Mad 399)
“21. The Full Bench has to consider in Raval's case, the following four questions-
(1) Do the Madras Acts including the latest Amending Act XI of 1964, enact a
self-contained Code governing all relationships between landlords and tenants,
during their subsistence including contractual as well as statutory tenants, within
their ambit?
(2) In particular, do they enable landlords and tenants to obtain the determination of
fair rents for buildings, even during the contractual tenancies and notwithstanding
the contract of rent. to which the tenancies relate?
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 (3) Similarly do they enable the
landlords and tenants to work out their respective rights in the matter of the liability of the tenants
for eviction on the grounds specified in the Acts, even during a contractual tenancy, and without
that tenancy being first determined by the landlord in accordance with S. 111(h) of the Transfer of
Property Act?
(4) Can this interpretation be sustained as a matter of legislative competence and legislative
intendment, notwithstanding the absence of a non obstante clause in the Act?
After a detailed and elaborate consideration of the legal position and the relevant decisions rendered
earlier by the Supreme Court, the Full Bench came to the conclusion that the legislative intendment
or the plain significance of the structure of the enactment admits only of one interpretation i.e.. they
interfere both with contractual and statutory tenancies by affording a special protection to tenants
against eviction and also balancing this by certain corresponding obligations imposed on tenants
that the Act is a complete Code in itself for eviction and for determination of fair rent in respect of
tenancies both contractual as well as statutory and that absence of non obstante clause does not
affect the interpretation of the Act with regard to inroads it makes upon the previous property law of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34909076/ 15M/S.Primex Healthcare And Research ... vs Mr.A.A.L.Ramaswamy on 29 September, 2022
landlords and tenants of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 buildings,
that the Act enables both landlords and tenants to seek the benefit of the Act under the provisions of
the Act, whether contractual tenancy with different terms prevails or whether it has been
determined. Dealing with the doctrine of inviolability of contractual rights, the Full Bench pointed
out that is impossible to accept that decision in the context of the welfare legislation which has
become a marked characteristics of modern times and that, therefore, notwithstanding the terms of
an existing contract it is open to the Legislature to enact that both a landlord and tenant may apply
for determination of the fair rent for premises though the contract may be subsisting. The facts in
that case are more or less identical with the facts of this case. In that case also there was a subsisting
contractual tenancy lease which had fixed a particular period and a sum as the monthly rent. The
tenant filed an application for determination of the fair rent for the building even during the
subsistence of the contractual tenancy notwithstanding the agreed rent. The lessors also filed
eviction petition against the tenant notwithstanding the period fixed under the lease.
22. This decision of the Full Bench was taken to the Supreme Court in Raval & Co. v.
Ramachandran. The Supreme Court by a majority of 3:2 affirmed the view taken by the Full Bench
and held that an analysis of the Tamil Nadu https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937
of 2022 Buldings (Lease and Rent Control) Act 1960, showed that it has a scheme of its own and it is
intended to provide a complete code in respect of both contractual tenancies, that the definitions of
'landlord' and 'tenant' also show that the Act applies to contractual as well as statutory tenancies,
that the provision for fixation of fair rent is for the benefit of both landlords and tenants whether it
is contractual tenancy or a statutory tenancy, that the provision that both the tenant and the
landlord can apply for fixation of fair rent would become meaningless if the fixation of fair rent will
only be downwards from the contracted rent and that the provision also indicates that the Act is
intended to apply to both contractual tenancies as well as statutory tenancies. The relevant
observations of the Supreme Court are these (at . 823).
"The provisions of the Act under consideration show that they are to take effect
notwithstanding any contract even during the subsistence of the contract. We have
already referred to the definition of the terms 'landlord' and 'tenant' which applies
both to subsisting tenancies as well as tenancies which might have come to an end.
We may also refer to the provisions in S. 7(2) which lays down that where the fair
rent of a building has not been fixed the landlord shall not claim anything in addition
to the agreed rent, thus showing that the fair rent can be fixed even where there is an
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 agreed rent. That is
why we have earlier pointed out that the various English decisions which provide for
fixation of rent only where the contractual tenancy has come to an end do not apply
here. We may also refer to sub-Section (3) of S. 10 which deals with cases where
landlord required a residential or non residential building for his own use. Clause (d)
of that sub-Section provides that where the tenancy is for a term the landlord cannot
get possession before the expiry of the term, thus showing that in other cases of
eviction covered by S. 10 eviction is permissible even during the continuance of the
contractual tenancy if the conditions laid down in S. 10 are satisfied."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34909076/ 16M/S.Primex Healthcare And Research ... vs Mr.A.A.L.Ramaswamy on 29 September, 2022
23. Thus there is a direct decision of the Full Bench of this court in Raval's case and of the Supreme
Court in Raval and Co. v. K. G. Ramachandran, holding that the provisions of the Act relating to
fixation of fair rent and eviction apply to all tenancies either contractual or statutory, if the
conditions laid down in the said Section s are satisfied.”
35. While confirming the constitutional validity of the Tamil Nadu Rent Control Act once again in
the above manner, the acceptance of the High Court and the Supreme Court for the terms ‘landlord’
and ‘tenant’ was also underlined and held that those terms are applicable to both the contractual
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 tenancy and statutory tenancy. By
following the above dictum the Division Bench of this court had held in Bapalal’s case that a tenant
whose contractual tenancy has come to an end should also be evicted only under due process of law
and for a tenant to file a suit to restrain his landlord from dispossessing him without due process, he
need not seek to declare his status as ‘tenant’. Because his status had already been settled as tenant
even after the termination of the tenancy.
36. By reading of the above judgments, it can be safely understood that a contractual tenant is a
person who is in occupation of the demised premises during the subsistence of the tenancy
agreement and the statutory tenant is the one whose contractual tenancy had come to an end either
by efflux of time or by act of parties or by law, but who continues to be in possession of the premises.
In case the landlord opts to receive rent from a tenant even after his tenancy got terminated, he is a
tenant by holding over within the meaning of Section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act.
37. Even a tenant whose tenancy got terminated should also be evicted only under due process.
Since such a statutory protection is given such https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 &
1937 of 2022 tenancies are called statutory tenancies. For a contractual tenancy, protection is
self-made by the parties as per the terms of their agreement. So a person whose tenancy has already
been expired, but still who cannot be evicted except under a due process of law, is a statutory tenant.
So the following conclusions can be arrived so far as the status of a tenant.
“(i) The terms landlord and ‘tenant’ under rent law includes both contractual and statutory tenant.
(as upheld by the High Court and the Supreme Court in Raval’s case).
(ii) So long as a person comes under the folder of either contractual or statutory tenancy, his status
as ‘tenant’ need not seek a relief for declaration about his status before any court of law. (Bapalal’s
case).
(iii) Once the due process for eviction is initiated and an order/decree for eviction is passed, the
statutory process is over and hence the tenant ceases to be a statutory tenant and thereafter he is
only a judgment debtor.
(iv) It is needless to mention that his contractual tenancy has already got terminated and hence he
ceased to be a contractual tenant also.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34909076/ 17M/S.Primex Healthcare And Research ... vs Mr.A.A.L.Ramaswamy on 29 September, 2022
(v) So, only a person against whom an order/ decree for eviction has been passed will loose the
status of ‘tenant’ and that is the reason why in the definition of ‘tenant’ under Section 2(n) of the
new TNRRRLT Act, that category alone is excluded.” https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022
38. Again there can not be any controversy between Section 5(3) of TNRRRLT Act and Section 116
of the Transfer of Property Act which speaks about holding over. But the only difference in the
TNRRRLT Act is that there is a damocles’ sword hanging over the head of a tenant who continues to
hold over for more than 6 months, without having a written extension of his tenancy. Because his
landlord can any time file a petition for eviction either under Section 21(2), for failure to enter into a
tenancy agreement or for being in possession after the termination of the agreement (Section 5(1))
or for remaining as a holding over tenant for more than 6 months (Section 5(3)).
39. Section 5 of the New Act speaks only about the period of tenancy and not about the change in the
status of the parties. Neither does it state that the landlord’s right to seek eviction before the Rent
Court will get expired at the end of 6 months of holding over tenancy. It is at the risk or at the will
and pleasure of the landlord to allow his tenant to hold over possession for more than 6 months. But
once the landlord chooses not to extend the agreement, he can immediately file a petition for
eviction either under Section 5(1). If the landlord allows the tenant to continue to be in possession
by receiving rent, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 without any
written extension of the agreement, his right to seek eviction opens at the end of 6 months of such
holding over under Section 5(3). While Section 21 provides grounds for eviction, Section 5(1) and (3)
provide situations when the tenant should vacate or get evicted. In fact they are deadlines for the
tenant to vacate the premises.
40. Since the terms of contract or contractual obligations are inviolable, certain specific grounds for
eviction during the subsistence of the contract is provided under Section 21. In other words, Section
21 is an exception to the general law that the terms of contract are inviolable. The constitutional
validity for providing such grounds for eviction under the Rent law, during the continuation of the
tenancy agreement, has already been upheld by the constitutional bench of the Supreme court in
Raval’s case, as stated above.
41. Section 5(3) of the New Act has just limited the time for holding over for six months, but by
accepting the principle of ‘tenancy by holding over’. In my view, it is an yet another enabling
provision by which the landlord can knock the doors of the rent Court for eviction, despite he had
chosen to receive the rent for some time after the expiry of the tenancy, but not
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 intended to renew the tenancy
agreement. Since the situations for seeking eviction under Section 5(1) or 5 (3) would arise only after
the termination of the contractual tenancy, the landlord is not under any obligation to plead or
prove any of the grounds under Section 21(2) for getting re-possession. In other words, after the
expiry of the tenancy, a landlord can seek eviction without the aid of Section 21(2). To put it in legal
terminologies, it can be said that the clauses under Section 21(2), except 21(2) (a) are applicable to
contractual tenancies and Section 5(1) and (3) are applicable to statutory tenancies.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34909076/ 18M/S.Primex Healthcare And Research ... vs Mr.A.A.L.Ramaswamy on 29 September, 2022
42. In the event of filing an Application for eviction under Section 5(3), the tenant cannot claim that
he has a right to continue to be in possession beyond six months, by stating that he is still a tenant
holding over and his tenancy is lawful under Section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act. It is not
because Section 5(3) of the TNRRRLT Act claims any supremacy over Section 116 of Transfer of
Property Act, but because of the constitutional validity given to the Rent Acts to accommodate
grounds to terminate tenancy (even during the subsistence of the contractual tenancy) immaterial of
it having or not having a non-obstante clause. The above exemption from the general
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 law is given because of the
regulatory and balancing nature of the Rent law Jurisprudence, and its ability to co-exist with the
general law.
43. Since the principle applied is unique to Rent law, it cannot be argued that Raval’s case had dealt
only the old Rent Control Act and not the new one and hence such principles cannot be applied to
the present situation. However, I limit this approval for exemption from general law only with
regard to providing grounds for eviction and the constitutional validity of which had already been
set at rest. Since the validity for such grounds has been upheld for terminating the subsisting
contract of tenancy, there can not be any fuss to provide situations prescribing deadlines for
agreements which have got expired already.
44. Since I only find Section 5(3) is an another enabling provision for seeking eviction, I have no
difficulty in answering the Revision Petitioner in C.R.P. (PD) No. 587 of 2022 that a tenant who
continues to be in possession beyond the prescribed period of six months under Section 5(3) is still a
tenant by holding over within the meaning of Section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act. But he is a
tenant at the risk of getting evicted at the instance of his https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 landlord any time after 6 months in view of the regulatory provision
of Section 5(3) of the Rent Act. It does not mean that the landlord who had chosen to receive rent
without having an intention to renew the agreement, cannot file an Application for eviction
immediately after the expiry of the agreement. If a landlord had chosen to receive rent after the
expiry of the tenancy agreement, his tenant might take a defence of holding over atleast for a period
of 6 months. Even according to Section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act, the effect of holding over
of the premises can only be renewed by once in six months or month by month, depending on the
purpose and at the option of the landlord to receive rent at every renewal.
45. In the order of the Rent Controller in C.R.P. (PD) No. 587 of 2022, it is observed that the Rent
Court can only deal with any matter relating to the rent agreement and not the issue raised by the
tenant in C.R.P. (PD) No. 587 of 2022. It is probably because of the contentions made about
repugnancy between Section 5(3) and Section 116 of the Transfer of the Property Act and
constitutional validity of some other provisions. As per Section 34 of the Act, the jurisdiction of the
Rent Court is given as under:
“34. Jurisdiction of Rent Court:
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 Notwithstanding
anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, in the areas to which
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34909076/ 19M/S.Primex Healthcare And Research ... vs Mr.A.A.L.Ramaswamy on 29 September, 2022
this Act extends, only the Rent Court and no Civil Court shall have jurisdiction,
except the jurisdiction of Rent Authority under Section 39, to hear and decide the
applications relating to disputes between landlord and tenant and matters connected
with and ancillary thereto covered under this Act:
Provided that the Rent Court shall, in deciding such applications relating to tenancies
and premises, give due regard to the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882,
the Indian Contract Act, 1872 or any other substantive law applicable to such matter
in the same manner, in which such law would have been applied had the dispute been
brought before a Civil Court by way of suit.”
46. In view of the duty bestowed on the Rent Court to decide the applications relating
to disputes between the land lord and tenant and matters connected and ancillary
there to covered under the Act, the Rent court can not shy away from deciding the
claim raised by the tenant by invoking Section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act and
render a finding. But the tenant need not have filed a separate miscellaneous
application to decide the above point as maintainability issue, though it is at his
option to raise it as his defence.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022
47. In fact the proviso to Section 34 would make the job of the Rent Controller more responsible as
it requires to strike a harmony between the provisions of the New Act and the provisions of the
substantive law like Transfer of Property Act and Indian Contract Act, 1872. So, every caution needs
to be taken to avoid head on collision between the various provisions of the new enactment and the
substantive law. Since the proviso to Section 34 itself demands harmonious interpretation by giving
due regard to other law wherever applicable, it is obligatory for the Courts to give maximum force to
both the Regulatory Rent Act and the substantive law to avoid any hardship or the risk of
repugnancy, by keeping in mind the object of the New Act and by adopting the principle of
harmonious construction. This is especially so for the new TNRRRLT Act (Act 42 of 2017), because
of the fact that the Act itself has been enacted on the recommendation of the Government of India in
order to enact an Act in the line of model tenancy Act. So, it is always safe and better to bring all the
disputes between the tenant and the landlord to be left to the jurisdiction of the Rent Court in terms
of Section 34 of the Act.
48. The jurisdiction of the Civil Court is barred under Section 40 of the
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 Act, so far as it relates to the
provisions of the Act. The above provision is carefully worded as under:
“Section 40: Jurisdiction of Civil Courts barred in respect of certain matters (1) Save
as otherwise provided in this Act, no civil court shall entertain any suit or proceeding
in so far as it relates to the provisions of this Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34909076/ 20M/S.Primex Healthcare And Research ... vs Mr.A.A.L.Ramaswamy on 29 September, 2022
(2) The jurisdiction of the Rent Court shall be limited to tenancy agreement
submitted to it as per First Schedule and the question of title and ownership of
premises shall be beyond its jurisdiction.”
49. However, to understand the scope of the jurisdiction of the Rent court one has to read Section
40(2) conjointly with Section 34 and not in isolation. The combined import of Section 34 and
Section 40 (2) is that, though at times the rent courts need to deal with the appropriate provisions of
the substantive law like a civil court, that should be for a limited purpose of deciding the dispute
between the landlord and tenant and matters connecting to tenancy and not otherwise. And the
question of title or ownership of the premises shall be dealt by the Civil Court in a regular suit and
not by the Rent Court. Similarly, if Section 34 and 40(1) are read together, it will only convey that
the civil court shall not have the jurisdiction decide the dispute between
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 the landlord and tenant and issues
connected to or ancillary to the tenancy, unless it involves a title dispute between themselves in
respect of the premises.
50. I feel it is relevant to mention that the TNRRRLT Act does not prescribe any period of limitation
for the both landlord and tenant to invoke Section 21(2) (a), on account of failure to enter into a
written tenancy agreement in accordance with Section 4(2). Though a time limit is prescribed under
Section 4(2) to enter into written tenancy for those tenancies created before the commencement of
the Act, no time limit is prescribed to file an Application for eviction under Section 21(2)(a).
Similarly no time limit is prescribed for the landlord to invoke Section 5(3) for filing an Application
for eviction, though it limits the time limit for holding over tenancy.
51. Obviously, the rent court cannot insist for producing a written tenancy agreement, for filing a
petition for eviction under Section 21(2)(a). The position has been made clear by this court in the
judgment of this court held in V.Manimegalai vs . Selvaraj Kannan and reported in (2019) (6) CTC 9.
In the said judgment, the Hon'ble Mr.Justice R. Suresh Kumar has
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 held as under:
“12. Therefore, it has become clear that, even in the absence of a written rental
agreement between the landlord and tenant especially the tenancy created before the
commencement of the Act i.e. on or before 22.02.2019 even in such circumstances,
on the sole ground of failure to enter into an agreement between the landlord and
tenant, both can approach the Rent Court under Section 22(1)(a) of the Act to seek
for termination of tenancy.
13.When that being the position, it cannot be construed that, for approaching the
Rent Court for getting relief of either termination of tenancy or repossession of the
premises by the landlord, such application to be filed under Section 21 of the Act be
accompanied with a registered rental agreement. Therefore, Section 4(3) can only be
construed that, by virtue of the provisions of the Act, there must be a written
agreement between the landlord and tenant and that is compulsorily registerable and
without being a registered document i.e. C.R.P.(NPD).No.3317 of 2019 rental
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34909076/ 21M/S.Primex Healthcare And Research ... vs Mr.A.A.L.Ramaswamy on 29 September, 2022
agreement, it does not have an evidentiary value, in other words, it is inadmissible in
evidence. Only to that purpose or to that extent alone, the effect of non-
registration of rental agreement can be construed or the provision of Section 4-A can be pressed into
service.” https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022
52. For those tenancies which have been created before or after the commencement of this Act
through a written agreement, the tenancy shall be in force only for the period which is agreed in the
tenancy agreement. If the parties do not wish to renew the tenancy, there is no difficulty and the
tenant can vacate the premises. If the landlord does not wish to renew the tenancy, though the
tenant intends, it is open to the landlord to file an Application for eviction, as his tenant can not
compel him to renew the tenancy.
53. As told already under Section 5(3) a time maximum limit of 6 months is prescribed tenancy by
holding over. Though this is also an enabling provision for the landlord along with Section 5 (1) to
seek eviction, there is no time limit prescribed for the landlord to file an Application for eviction.
The time limit prescribed under the rules to register the tenancy agreement with the Rent Authority
will be applicable only to those cases, where the landlord is willing to renew the expired tenancy. As
stated already, the tenant cannot take a defence of holding over for more than 6 months, in case his
landlord files an https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 Application for
eviction after the termination of the agreement. Hence the tenant needs to be vigilant in getting his
tenancy duly renewed and registered as per the Act in order to safeguard his interest. No tenant can
compel his landlord to renew the tenancy agreement, in case he does not choose to renew the
tenancy agreement and the tenant has to simply vacate the premises after the agreement expires.
Though as per Rule 5, the landlord has to intimate the expiry of tenancy within 15 days, no
consequential action or penalty is contemplated for violation. Hence there are possibilities to flout
the written tenancy agreement rule, subsequent to its expiry indirectly by way of filing applications
for eviction any time under Section 21(2) (a) or under Section 5(1) and 5(3).
54. As a matter of clarity, I would like to add that the law of limitation applicable to suits for
recovery possession is entirely on a different footing and it has nothing to do with the applications
for eviction filed before the Rent Court. Even for any extraneous reasons if it is presumed that
Article 137 of the Limitation Act should be invoked for Applications filed for eviction under Section
21(2) (a), 5(1) and 5(3), there can be a continuing cause of action for the landlord so long as his
tenant occupies the premises and so long as the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 &
1937 of 2022 terms landlord and tenant is applicable to both the contractual and statutory
tenancies. Since the term ‘tenant’ is inapplicable only to those persons against whom order / decree
for eviction has been passed, the cause of action for the landlord to file an application for eviction
shall continue to exist so long as the person in occupation of the premises falls under the definition
of tenant. In fact the Act does not exclude the applicability of the Act to any type of landlords and
tenants, but only to certain type of places and premises. Even while exempting certain premises,
liberty is given to the owners of the exempted premises to opt to come under the purview of the Act
by expressing the desire to the Rent Authority and avail the fast-track remedies.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34909076/ 22M/S.Primex Healthcare And Research ... vs Mr.A.A.L.Ramaswamy on 29 September, 2022
55. The danger of depriving the status of tenant for those persons who continue to occupy the
premises after the expiry of the agreement and driving the landlord to file a suit for ejectment, is to
put the landlord to face the risk of law of limitation for recovery of possession, against his own
tenant and also to undergo the time consuming civil court proceedings to the advantage of a
defaulted tenant. This would cause an imbalance between two defaulting parties who had failed to
execute or renew the written tenancy and that is totally against the object of the New Act.
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022
56. Except the consequence and impact of the unwritten and unregistered tenancy under Section
4-A of the Act, no other consequence or impact is stated in the Act for not adhering to its directions.
Even the failure to register the written agreement within the time stipulated under the rules of the
New Act can be mitigated by filing a petition to condone the delay under Section 5 of the limitation
Act. It is needless to state that Section 5 of the Limitation Act is applicable for any appeal or
application. It is better to extract Section 5 of the Limitation Act:
Limitation Act- Section 5 Extension of prescribed period in certain cases:
Any appeal or any application, other than an application under any of the provisions
of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, may be admitted after the
prescribed period, if the appellant or the applicant satisfies the Court that he had
sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the application within such
period.”
57. Hence in case of delay in registering the tenancy agreements entered between the parties in
compliance of Section 4(1) and (2), that can be https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 &
1937 of 2022 done by filing an Application under Section 4(3) along with the petition to condone the
delay in filing a the Application under Section 4(3).
58. In C.R.P.No.1937 of 2022, the revision petitioner is the landlord. He has stated that his tenancy
agreement with the tenant was a written and registered tenancy agreement dated 25.05.1968 for 55
years. In the understanding of the said petitioner, the “registration” contemplated is the registration
under the Registration Act. The petition for eviction filed by the landlord was rejected at the
threshold itself on the observation that the tenancy agreement was not registered with the Rent
Authority as required under Section 4(3) of the Act.
59. Since the tenancy agreement dated 25.05.1968 is for 55 years and it is written, it is still in force.
The registration contemplated under Section 4 (3) of the New Rent Act is independent and
immaterial of the compliance of the mandatory registration requirement contemplated under
Section 17(d) of the Registration Act. Because Section 4-A of the New Rent Act is also independent
and immaterial of Section 49 of the Registration Act. For the sake of completion I would add that
the mandatory written agreement required https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937
of 2022 under Section 4(1) of the New Rent Act is also independent and immaterial of Section 107 of
the Transfer of Property Act. However, I am not on deciding the constitutional compatibility of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34909076/ 23M/S.Primex Healthcare And Research ... vs Mr.A.A.L.Ramaswamy on 29 September, 2022
those provisions, as this is not a writ petition. The registration mandated under the New Rent Act is
a kind of enrolment of tenancy in the Roll of tenancy register maintained by the Rent Authority. It is
like the enrolment of any other kind of business dealing or profession required under the relevant
enactments.
60. In any case, the learned Rent Controller need not have rejected the petition, since the rent
agreement is a written one and is still in force. Instead, the petition could have been returned to
comply the registration formalities under rule 4 of the New Rent rules and represent it after
compliance. Since the agreement period is going to expire shortly, if the landlord complies the
registration formalities of the Act, he can get a green signal for eviction under Section 5(1) also.
61. Since the lease agreement dated 25.05.1968 is a written and registered under the registration
Act, it is upto the landlord to register the same in accordance with Rule 4 of the Tamil Nadu
Regulation of Rights and https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022
Responsibilities of Landlord and Tenant Rules 2019, if the time limit is still available. If the time
limit is expired, he can still file an application for registration along with a petition to condone the
delay in registration. It is needless to state that while calculating the time limit prescribed under
Rule 4, the time during which the proceedings were pending before the Court shall be excluded as
per Section 12 of the limitation Act.
62. Since the lease period is going to expire shortly, if the landlord complies the above formality, he
can also file a petition for eviction under Section 5(1) of the New Act. In that event, he need not seek
an accommodation in any of the compartments given under Section 21 of the Act. As stated already
Section 21 comes into picture only when an Application for eviction needs to be filed during the
subsistence of the tenancy agreement or when the parties fail to enter into an written agreement.
63. One question that would linger in the minds of parties to the oral tenancy agreement or the
parties who failed to register their written tenancy agreement would be should they remain
remediless under the New Act. In case the parties are willing to continue the tenancy but have not
chosen to https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 reduce the terms of
tenancy into writing, it is always open to them to enter into a fresh tenancy agreement by giving
effect to the tenancy from the date when the tenancy agreement is entered. The said written tenancy
agreement can be registered in terms of Section 4(3) of the Act. However, neither the tenant nor the
landlord can seek any of their respective dues or liabilities that might have accrued to them in view
of the oral or unregistered tenancy pending between themselves prior to the date of their newly
written agreement. Because those claims are non-est in the eyes of the New Act, since they fall
outside its purview. Anything falls outside the purview of the whole of the Act includes the bar under
Section 40 also. Hence the parties are not deprived to file civil suits if they have any valid claims
between the above said period and if they are maintainable under any of the law in force.
64. Since the New Act is still a toddler more awareness needs to be been given about the evils of oral
tenancy and non-registration of tenancy under the New Act. Though the Act is applicable to urban
area, due to the mixed demography of the urban mass it is not easy for the New Act to percolate in
the minds of the people, who still stick to the time-tested old law and practice where they enjoyed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34909076/ 24M/S.Primex Healthcare And Research ... vs Mr.A.A.L.Ramaswamy on 29 September, 2022
oral tenancy. And the time limit of 570 days https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937
of 2022 is still not too long a period to change that practice. The irony of the New Act is that though
it brings the sub-tenants who do not have any sort of privity of either oral or written contract of
tenancy with the landlord under its wings, it excludes the parties to oral tenancy agreement. Hence
the Rent Authorities shall be liberal whenever application for registration of tenancy is filed with a
petition to condone the delay in filing the said Applications.
65. In the result,
(i) C.R.P. (PD) No. 587 of 2022 is disposed in terms of the observation given under paragraph
No.44. No costs. For the sake of convenience paragraph No.44 is reproduced as below:
“44. Since I only find Section 5(3) is an another enabling provision for seeking
eviction, I have no difficulty in answering the Revision Petitioner in C.R.P. (PD) No.
587 of 2022 that a tenant who continues to be in possession beyond the prescribed
period of six months under Section 5(3) is still a tenant by holding over within the
meaning of Section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act. But he is a tenant at the risk
of getting evicted at the instance of his landlord any time after 6 months in view of
the regulatory provision of Section 5(3) of the Rent Act. It does not mean that the
landlord who had chosen to receive rent without having an intention to renew the
agreement, cannot file an Application for eviction https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
C.R.P.Nos.587 & 1937 of 2022 immediately after the expiry of the agreement. If a
landlord had chosen to receive rent after the expiry of the tenancy agreement, his
tenant might take a defence of holding over atleast for a period of 6 months. Even
according to Section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act, the effect of holding over of
the premises can only be renewed by once in six months or month by month,
depending on the purpose and at the option of the landlord to receive rent at every
renewal.”
(ii) C.R.P.No.1937 of 2022 is partly allowed in terms of the observation rendered
under paragraph Nos. 59 and 60 and the order and decree of the learned Rent
Controller/ X Small Cause Judge, Chennai passed in RLTOP SR.No.694 of 2022
dated 18.04.2022 is set aside and the unnumbered Petition filed in RLTOP
SR.No.694 of 2022 is ordered to be returned with a direction to represent it after
complying of the registration formalities under Section 4(3) of the New Act in
accordance with Rule 4. No costs. As observed already the revision petitioner is at
liberty to file his Application for registration under Section 4(3) along with the
petition to condone the delay in filing the Application under Section 4(3). For the
sake of convenience paragraph Nos.
59 and 60 are reproduced as under:
“59. Since the tenancy agreement dated 25.05.1968 is for 55 years and it is written, it
is still in force. The registration https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis C.R.P.Nos.587 &
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34909076/ 25M/S.Primex Healthcare And Research ... vs Mr.A.A.L.Ramaswamy on 29 September, 2022
1937 of 2022 contemplated under Section 4(3) of the New Rent Act is independent
and immaterial of the compliance of the mandatory registration requirement
contemplated under Section 17(d) of the Registration Act. Because Section 4-A of the
New Rent Act is also independent and immaterial of Section 49 of the Registration
Act. For the sake of completion I would add that the mandatory written agreement
required under Section 4(1) of the New Rent Act is also independent and immaterial
of Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act.
However, I am not on deciding the constitutional compatibility of those provisions, as this is not a
Writ Petition. The registration mandated under the New Rent Act is a kind of enrolment of tenancy
in the Roll of tenancy register maintained by the Rent Authority. It is like the enrolment of any other
kind of business dealing or profession required under the relevant enactments.
60. In any case, the learned Rent Controller need not have rejected the petition, since the rent
agreement is a written one and is still in force. Instead, the petition could have been returned to
comply the registration formalities under Rule 4 of the New Rent Rules and represent it after
compliance. Since the agreement period is going to expire shortly, if the landlord complies the
registration formalities of the Act, he can get a green signal for eviction under Section 5(1) also”
