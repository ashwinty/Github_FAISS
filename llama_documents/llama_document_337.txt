1. This is a suit for recovery of Rs 24,90,665/-.
Defendant No. 1 is a company alleged to be owned and
controlled by defendant No. 4 and his family members.
Defendant No. 3 is the wife of defendant No. 4 and is
running business in the name and style of defendant No. 2
CS(OS)No. 1362/1997 Page 1 of 43
from the same premises, where defendant No. 1 is
functioning. Defendant No. 1-company entered into an
agreement to purchase one lakh litres of weedicide, namely
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/258211/ 1M/S. Herbicides (India) Ltd. vs M/S. Shashank Pesticides P.Ltd. on 13 May, 2011
2, 4-D Ethyl Ester 38% EC in 200 litres packaging, at the
price of Rs 96.80 per litre plus local tax in staggered lots
commencing from October, 1995 and ending in December,
1995. In the event of non-supply or non-lifting of goods, the
party, in default, was to pay pre-determined compensation
at the rate of Rs 20/- per litre. The plaintiff claims to have
supplied 7000 litres of the aforesaid goods to defendant No.
1 in October, 1995. On the request of the defendant, invoice
in respect of these 7000 litre of goods were raised on one
M/s Paramount Pesticides Pvt. Ltd., nominee of the
defendant.
Vide letters dated 14th November, 1995 and 17th
November, 1995, defendant Nos.1 and 4 informed the
plaintiff that due to failure of season, the market had
crashed and they were not in a position to make any
commitment for lifting or for making financial arrangement
for further quantities. The plaintiff, thereupon, informed the
defendant that it had made all the necessary arrangements
for supply of contracted goods and its refusal to lift the
CS(OS)No. 1362/1997 Page 2 of 43
goods would cause immense loss to the plaintiff. The
plaintiff asked defendant No. 1 to make arrangements to
take delivery of the entire quantity during November and
December. Since the defendants have failed to act upon the
request and have also paid the price of 7000 litre of goods
supplied to it, the plaintiff is now seeking a sum of Rs
18,60,000/- towards pre-determined compensation at the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/258211/ 2M/S. Herbicides (India) Ltd. vs M/S. Shashank Pesticides P.Ltd. on 13 May, 2011
rate of Rs 20/- per litre of unlifted quantity of the goods, Rs
1,97,472/-+ 2,93,680/- toward balance price of 7000 litre of
goods after adjusting the payment of Rs 2 lakhs made by
the defendant and Rs 1,39,513/- (56,093 + 83,420) towards
interest at the rate of 18% per annum on the principal
amount due from the defendant.
2. The defendants have contested the suit and have
taken a preliminary objection that the suit is bad for mis-
joinder of parties since there is no privity of contract
between the plaintiff and defendant Nos. 2 and 3 and there
was no personal contract between the plaintiff and
defendant No. 4. They have also taken a preliminary
objection that suit against defendant No. 2, which is not a
legal entity, is not maintainable. On merits, it has been
alleged that the plaintiff was to deliver 10,000 litre of goods
CS(OS)No. 1362/1997 Page 3 of 43
by the eve of Diwali 1995 and the balance quantity was to
be delivered in regular intervals commencing from 1 st
November, 1995 and was to be completed by 15th December,
1995, but, the plaintiff failed to effect the delivery of any
part of the goods, despite receiving Rs 4 lakhs from them. It
is further alleged that after expiry of season, the plaintiff
tried to foist goods on defendant No. 1, but, at that time the
goods were of no use to them. The defendants have denied
having received 7000 litre of goods from the plaintiff and
having asked the plaintiff to raise invoice in the name of
Paramount Pesticides Pvt. Ltd. The defendant Nos. 1 and 4
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/258211/ 3M/S. Herbicides (India) Ltd. vs M/S. Shashank Pesticides P.Ltd. on 13 May, 2011
have filed a counter-claim of Rs 5,45,000/- against the
plaintiff on the ground that it had not refunded the amount
of Rs 4 lakhs, received from them and, therefore was liable
to refund that amount along with interest amounting to Rs
1,44,000/- and Rs 1,100/- towards Advocate fee for service
of notice. In its replication, the plaintiff-company has
admitted receipt of total payment of Rs 4 lakhs from
defendant No. 1

Issues No. 10, 11 & 12
4. This is not in dispute that only the plaintiff-
company and defendant No.1-company were parties to the
agreement for supply of goods. Defendant No. 1 is a legal
entity and defendant No. 4 is one of its Directors. There is,
however, no privity of contract between the plaintiff and
CS(OS)No. 1362/1997 Page 6 of 43
defendant Nos. 3 and 4. If there is a breach of contract on
the part of defendant No. 1 or defendant No. 1-company has
failed to pay the price of the goods received by it from the
plaintiff-company, the remedy of the plaintiff-company lies
only against defendant No. 1 and neither defendant No. 3
nor defendant No. 4 is personally liable to discharge the
liability of defendant No. 1. Defendant No. 2 is not a legal
entity and is only a trade name adopted by defendant No. 3.
The issues are accordingly decided in favour of the
defendants and against the plaintiff. The names of
defendant No. 2 to 4 are struck off from the array of
defendants.
Issue No. 2
Ex.PW-1/1 is the copy of the Resolution passed by
the Board of Directors of the plaintiff-company, authorizing
Mr Ahok Dugar, Mr V.P. Singal, Mr R.K. Gupta and Mr
Paras Parakh and to commence & institute suits, etc. on
behalf of the plaintiff-company and to sign and verify the
pleadings etc. The suit having been instituted and the plaint
having been signed and verified by Mr Ashok Dugar, the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/258211/ 6M/S. Herbicides (India) Ltd. vs M/S. Shashank Pesticides P.Ltd. on 13 May, 2011
issue is decided in favour of the plaintiff and against the
defendants.
CS(OS)No. 1362/1997 Page 7 of 43
Issues No.3 & 5
5. PW-1/A, Mr. Ashok Dugar, Director of the plaintiff-
company, has stated that 7000 litre of goods in 35 drums
were dispatched vide GR dated 21st October, 1995
(Ex.PW1/5) and the delivery of the consignment was taken
by defendant Nos. 1 and 4, making endorsement in this
record on the back side of GR. It has come in the deposition
of PW-1 that the goods were moved by the plaintiff-company
from Jaipur to Delhi on Stock Transfer basis and the truck,
containing 7,000 litre of stock, was unloaded at the godown
of defendant No. 1. It has also come in his deposition that
defendant No. 4 Mr R.K. Gupta, who is the Director of
defendant No. 1-company, was in touch with the officials of
the plaintiff-company so that delivery could be taken at the
godown of defendant No. 1.
In rebuttal, DW-1, Mr R.K. Gupta, has stated that no
goods were supplied by the plaintiff to defendant No. 1. A
perusal of the Goods Receipt Ex.PW-1/5 shows that it bears
an endorsement of receipt of 35 drums on the back of the
document. It is also noted in the endorsement that one
drum had leakage from it. The GR pertains to 35 drums of
CS(OS)No. 1362/1997 Page 8 of 43
pesticides, the consignor as well as consignee is Harbicides
India Ltd. and the goods were sent from Jaipur to Delhi on
21st October, 1995. According to Mr Ashok Dugar, these
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/258211/ 7M/S. Herbicides (India) Ltd. vs M/S. Shashank Pesticides P.Ltd. on 13 May, 2011
goods were received by Mr Vishesh Jain of the defendant,
who made the endorsement on the back of this document. It
has been admitted by Mr R.K. Gupta that Mr Vishesh Jain
is also a Director of defendant No. 1. Since Mr Ashok Dugar
had, in his deposition, claimed that these goods were
received by Mr Vishesh Jain, it was incumbent on defendant
No. 1 to produce Mr Vishesh Jain in the witness box to
controvert the deposition of Mr Ashok Dugar in this regard
and to prove that neither the goods were received by him
nor does the GR Ex.PW-1/5 bear an endorsement by him.
6. In Enuga Lakshmamma Vs. Vennapuse Chinna
Malla Reddy (Dead) by Lrs., 1985 (2) SCC 100, there was
dispute with respect to the date of birth of the
plaintiff/appellant. It was noticed that the father of the
plaintiff/appellant was not produced as a witness. Supreme
Court was of the view that non-examination of the father of
the plaintiff/appellant on the most material issue, namely,
the birth date of the plaintiff will have to be regarded as
fatal to the plaintiff's case and the High Court was right in
CS(OS)No. 1362/1997 Page 9 of 43
drawing adverse inference against the plaintiff on this
aspect.
In Iswar Bhai C. Patel @ Bachu Bhai Patel Vs.
Harihar Behera & Anr. 1999 (3) SCC 457, the appellant did
not enter the witness-box to deny on oath. The statement of
defendant/respondent No.2 that it was at the instance of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/258211/ 8M/S. Herbicides (India) Ltd. vs M/S. Shashank Pesticides P.Ltd. on 13 May, 2011
the appellant that he had advanced a amount of Rs 7,000/- to the appellant by issuing a cheque on
the account of respondent No.1. The Court was of the view that the appellant having not entered the
witness box and having not presented himself for cross-examination, an adverse presumption has to
be drawn against him on the basis of the principles contained in Illustration (g) of Section 114 of
Evidence Act.
No explanation has been given by defendant No. 1 for not producing Mr Vishesh Jain in the witness
box. It can, therefore, be presumed that had Mr Vishesh Jain been produced in the witness box he
would not have supported the case of defendant No. 1 in this regard.
7. Ex.PW1/18 is the copy of the letters dated 20th November, 1995, sent by the plaintiff-company to
defendant No. 1. It is subsequently stated in this letter that the plaintiff had supplied only 7000 litre
of goods to the defendant No. 1 against its assurance to lift 60,000 litre of goods during November,
1995, thereby leaving a shortfall of 56,000 litres. This letter was sent vide Courier Receipt
Ex.PW-1/19. Ex.PW-1/20 is the letter dated 29 th November, 1995 from the plaintiff-company to
defendant No. 1 which purports to have been delivered by hand on 29 th November, 1995 and bears
the stamp of defendant No. 1. Vide this letter, the plaintiff sought billing instructions for the balance
5,000 liters supplied to defendant No. 1 and also sought dispatch instructions for the balance
53,000 litres to be supplied, during November and 40,000 litre to be supplied during December.
This is not the case of the defendant that Ex.PW-1/20 does not bear stamp of defendant No. 1. In his
affidavit, Mr R.K. Gupta did not claim that the signature and stamp on this letter have been forged
by the plaintiff-company. Ex.P-1/21 is the letter dated 23rd December, 1995 sent by the
plaintiff-company to defendant No. 1, referring to the telephonic discussion, wherein the plaintiff
had requested defendant No. 1 to place further order for 93,000 litre, enclosing therewith invoice
No. 655 for supply of 5,000 litre of goods and informing that 2000 litre of goods had already been
billed on Paramount Pesticide Pvt. Ltd., Meerut as per the advice of the plaintiff. This letter was sent
by registered post vide postal receipt Ex.PW-1/22 and the AD card bearing the stamp of defendant
No. 1 is Ex. PW.1/23. Section 27 of General Clauses Act gives rise to presumption that service of
notice has been effected when it is sent to the correct address by registered post. Similar
presumption can be raised under Section 114 (e) of Evidence Act, once it is proved that a letter by
registered post was sent at the correct address of the addressee and the registered envelope is not
received back unserved, a statutory presumption of service on the addressee arises. Therefore, even
if the AD card filed by the plaintiff is excluded from consideration, the service of this letter stands
proved on account of the letter having been sent by registered post at the correct address of
defendant No. 1-company.
8. Moreover, no evidence has been led by defendant No.1 to prove that the stamp on the AD
Ex.PW-1/23 is not of defendant No. 1-company and/or the signature and stamp on this document
have been forged by the plaintiff- company. No such claim was made by Mr R.K. Gupta in his
affidavit by way of evidence and no other witness has been produced by the defendant. Had the
plaintiff not supplied 7000 litres of goods, defendant No. 1 would not have remained silent to the
averments made in this regard in the letters Ex.PW-1/19 PW-1/20 and PW-1/21 and would have
definitely controverted the same by writing to the plaintiff- company, immediately of receipt of these
letters, that no material at all had been supplied to it. Failure of defendant No. 1 to controvert the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/258211/ 9M/S. Herbicides (India) Ltd. vs M/S. Shashank Pesticides P.Ltd. on 13 May, 2011
averment made in the letters in this regard indicates that these goods were actually supplied to
defendant No. 1 and the plea taken by the defendants in this regard are false. The plaintiff-company,
therefore, is entitled to recover the balance price of that 7000 litre goods, but only from defendant
No.1. The balance amount, payable towards price of 7000 litre of goods, after deducting Rs 4 lakhs
paid to the plaintiff-company, comes to Rs 91152/-. The issue is decided against accordingly.
9. A perusal of Ex.PW-1/3 which is the letter of the plaintiff-company dated 19th October, 1995,
Ex.P-1/D1 & D-4, which is the letter of defendant No. 1 dated 20 th October, 1995, Ex.PW-1/4, which
is the letter of the plaintiff-company dated 21st October, 1995, Ex.P-2/D1 & D4, which is the letter of
defendant No. 1 dated 26 th October, 1995, discloses the following terms agreed between the parties:
(a) The total quantity agreed to be purchased by defendant No. 1 was 1 lakh litres;
(b) The agreed price as per letter Ex.PW-1/3 was Rs 96.80 per litre + 2% local
tax/CST Form in lieu of the sale. The rate given in the letter of defendant No. 1 is Rs
88 per litre + excise, which I am informed comes to Rs 96.80 per litre only;
(c) 10,000 litres of the material was to be supplied by the eve of Diwali, 1995;
(d) The supplies were to be completed by 15th December, 1995; 60,000 litres were to
be supplied up to 30th November and the balance quantity in December, 1995, and
were to be made at regular intervals, maintaining proper ratio.
(e) In case of either non-supply on the part of the plaintiff or non-lifting of goods on
the part of defendant No. 1, a sum of Rs 20 per litre was agreed to be paid as
compensation by the party in default.
10. Ex.P-4/D1&D4 is the letter dated 14th November, 1995, written by defendant No. 1 to the
plaintiff-company, enclosing therewith a circular issued by M/s Parijat Agencies Pvt. Ltd and
seeking review of the matter on account of market conditions being bad and season having been
miserably failed. Ex.P-5/D1&D4 is the letter dated 17 th November, 1995 written by defendant No. 1
to the plaintiff- company, referring to the earlier letter dated 14th November, 1995 (Ex.P-4/D1&D4)
and regretting that the season had miserably failed and therefore, the market had crashed. It was
stated in this letter that since there was no lifting and no finances in the market, defendant No. 1 was
not in a position to make any commitment for lifting or to make financial arrangements. Defendant
No. 1-company expressed its inability to pursue the matter in the circumstances and requested the
plaintiff-company to make some alternative arrangement. In view of these letters, it cannot be
disputed that defendant No.1-company had refused to accept any further delivery from the plaintiff-
company and, thereby committed breach of contract to purchase one lakh litre of goods from the
plaintiff-company.
In its letter dated 20th November, 1995 (Ex.PW- 1/18), the plaintiff-company informed defendant
No. 1 that on account of firm written confirmation from it they had already procured 40 M.T. of 2,
4-D Ethyl Ester technical Remix/Acromax and also liquid Emulsifiers costing approximately Rs 83
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/258211/ 10M/S. Herbicides (India) Ltd. vs M/S. Shashank Pesticides P.Ltd. on 13 May, 2011
lakhs and defendant No. 1's failure to lift the material would put them to a great loss. Vide letter
dated 21st November, 1995 (Ex.PW-1/20), the plaintiff again sought instructions for dispatch of
remaining 93 litre of goods. These letters indicate that the plaintiff-company had obtained the
necessary raw material and was in a position to supply the remaining 93,000 litre of goods to
defendant No. 1.
11. In his affidavit by way of evidence, Mr Ashok Dugar, Director of the plaintiff-company, has
specifically stated that the plaintiff duly made all arrangements and procured all the raw-material,
consisting mainly of 2,4-D Ethyl Ester Technical and required stabilizers, solvents and drums etc. at
a considerable cost. According to him, the plaintiff purchased a total quantity of 60 MT of 2,4-D
Ethyl Ester Technical at the relevant time which also included 39 MT of 2,4-D Ethyl Ester Technical
required for formulation of one lakh litres of the said goods. The said 39 Mt was procured at a
landed cost of Rs 73,61,250/-. He has further stated that the plaintiff had also procured other
emulsifiers, drums, solvents, etc. at an approximate value of Rs 15,00,000/- in order to fulfil its
obligations in supplying one lakh litres of the said goods to the defendants 1 and 4. He has also
referred in his evidence to Ex.PW-1/6 to 15, which are the invoices by the Atul Products Ltd. on the
plaintiff, during August, 1995 to November, 1995 towards supply of 2,4-D, Ethyl Ester Technical.
12. The learned counsel for the defendant has objected to the invoices being read in evidence on the
ground that they have not been proved in accordance with law as the person, who procured the
invoices, has not been produced in the witness-box. In support of his contention that mere putting
exhibit marks on the document does not by ipso facto amount to proof of the document. The learned
counsel for the defendant has referred to decisions of Sait Tarajee Khimchand And Ors. vs Yelamarti
Satyam Alias Satteyya And Ors., AIR 1971 SC 1865 and Narbada Devi Gupta vs Birendra Kumar
Jaiswal And Anr. AIR 2004 SC
175.
13. Even if these invoices are excluded from consideration, the deposition of PW-1, read along with
letters sent by the plaintiff-company to defendant No. 1- company, clearly shows that the
plaintiff-company had procured the requisite raw-material for supply of one lakh litre of the
material to defendant No. 1-company. Vide letter dated 20th November, 1995 (Ex.PW-1/18) in
response to defendant No.1's letter dated 17th November, 1995, the plaintiff-company informed it
that on their firm written confirmation, it had already procured 40 M.T. of 2, 4-D Ethyl Ester
technical Remix/Acromax and also liquid Emulsifiers costing approximately Rs 83 lakhs and their
declining to lift the material when the goods were ready for dispatch was not only against business
ethics, but will also put the plaintiff to a great loss. Defendant No. 1-company was requested to make
balance payment so as to enable the plaintiff-company to deliver the balance quantity of 53,000
litres which was to be delivered in November, 1995 and to make necessary arrangement for further
40,000 litres which was to be supplied during December 1995. There was no response from
defendant No. 1 to this letter. Vide letter dated 29th November, 1995 (Ex.PW-1/20), the plaintiff
again requested defendant No. 1 to send dispatch instructions for the balance 53000 litres to be
supplied during November and 40,000 litres to be supplied during December so as to enable it to
arrange immediate supply from Jaipur plant. Again, there was no response from defendant No.1.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/258211/ 11M/S. Herbicides (India) Ltd. vs M/S. Shashank Pesticides P.Ltd. on 13 May, 2011
These letters, coupled with the deposition of PW-1 Ashok Dugar, are sufficient to prove that the
plaintiff-company had either produced the remaining 93000 litres of the finished product or at least
53000 litre which was the balance quantity to be supplied in November, 1995 or it had at least
procured the necessary raw material and was ready to supply those goods to defendant No.
1-company immediately on receiving dispatch instructions and requisite payment from it. Even
otherwise, it is difficult to say that the plaintiff-company would not have procured raw material even
up to 17 th November, 1995, when it had to supply 600 litres of material during November, 1995 and
40,000 of material during December, 1995. The plaintiff-company had agreed to pay liquidated
damages at the rate of Rs 20 per litre in case of its failure to supply the goods, within the agreed
time. Therefore, it would not have taken the risk of paying those damages to defendant
No.1-company and, therefore, must have procured the necessary raw material for this purpose.
14. It was contended by the learned counsel for the defendants that even if there was breach of
contract on behalf of defendant No.1 and despite the contract between the parties providing for
payment of liquidated damages in case of breach of contract on the part of either party, the
plaintiff-company is not entitled to damages since there was no proof of any damages having been
actually suffered by it. In support of his contention, he has relied upon the decision of Supreme
Court in Fateh Chand vs. Balkishan Dass, AIR 1963 SC 1405, Maula Bux vs. UOI AIR 1970 SC 1955
and Gopal Krishnaji vs. Mohamed. Haji, AIR 1968 SC 1413. The learned Counsel for the plaintiff on
the other hand contended that since the contract between the parties stipulated payment of
liquidated damages which was a bona fide and genuine pre-estimate of the loss which the plaintiff
company was likely to suffer because of breach of contract on the part of the defendant, it was not
necessary for the plaintiff company to prove the actual damages and it is entitled to recover the
liquidated damages at the rate stipulated in the contract. In support of his contention that the
plaintiff-company is entitled to damages at the agreed rate of Rs 20 per litre, the learned Counsel for
the plaintiff has relied upon BSNL vs. Reliance Communication Ltd. (2011) 1 SCC 394 and ONGC vs.
Saw Pipes Ltd AIR 2003 SC 2629.
15. In the case of Fateh Chand (supra), the agreement for sale of the suit property provided that if
the vendee fails to get the sale deed registered by 1st June, 1949, a sum of Rs 25,000/- which he had
paid to the vendor, shall be deemed to be forfeited and the agreement cancelled. Alleging that the
agreement was rescinded, on account of default on the part of the defendant and the amount of Rs
25,000/- paid by him had been forfeited, the plaintiff filed a suit for recovery of possession of the
suit property which he had delivered to the vendee. Referring to Section 74 of Indian Contract Act,
Supreme Court, inter alia, observed as under:
"The measure of damages in the case of breach of a stipulation by way of penalty is by
s. 74 reasonable compensation not exceeding the penalty stipulated for. In assessing
damages the Court has, subject to the limit of the penalty stipulated, jurisdiction to
award such compensation as it deems reasonable having regard to all the
circumstances of the case. Jurisdiction of the Court to award compensation in case of
breach of contract is unqualified except as to the maximum stipulated; but
compensation has to be reasonable, and that imposes upon the Court duty to award
compensation according to settled principles. The section undoubtedly says that the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/258211/ 12M/S. Herbicides (India) Ltd. vs M/S. Shashank Pesticides P.Ltd. on 13 May, 2011
aggrieved party is entitled to receive compensation from the party who has broken
the contract, whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused by
the breach. Thereby it merely dispenses with proof of "actual loss or damages"; it
does not justify the award of compensation when in consequence of the breach no
legal injury at all has resulted, because compensation for breach of contract can be
awarded to make good loss or damage which naturally arose in the usual course of
things, or which the parties knew when they made the contract, to be likely to result
from the breach." (emphasis supplied)
16. In the case of Maula Bux (supra), the contract between the plaintiff and defendant-Union of
India provided for forfeiture of the security deposit in case of rescission of the contract. Government
of India rescinded the contracts and forfeited the amount which the plaintiff had deposited with it. A
suit for recovery of Rs 20,000/- was the filed by the plaintiff against Union of India. The suit was
dismissed by the Trial Court, holding that though the Government of India was justified in
rescinding the contract, they could not have forfeited the amount of deposit as they had not suffered
any loss in consequence of the default committed by the plaintiff. The High Court, however,
awarded a sum of Rs 416.25 to the plaintiff along with interest. The High Court, in awarding the
aforesaid sum to the plaintiff, took into consideration the decision of Supreme Court in the case of
Fateh Chand (supra), but felt that the aforesaid judgment did not purport to overrule the previous
trend of authorities to the effect that earnest money deposited by way of security for due
performance of a contract does not constitute penalty contemplated under Section 74 of Indian
Contract Act and even if it was held otherwise, the Government was entitled to receive from the
plaintiff reasonable compensation not exceeding that amount, whether or not actual damage was
proved to have been caused.
17. Setting aside the order of High Court and restoring that of the Trial Court, the Supreme Court,
inter alia, observed as under:
"Where under the terms of the contract the party in breach has undertaken to pay a
sum of money or to forfeit a sum of money which he has already paid to the party
complaining of a breach of contract, the undertaking is of the nature of a penalty......
.....It is true that in every case of breach of contract the person aggrieved by the
breach is not required to prove actual loss or damage suffered by him before he can
claim a decree, and the Court is competent to award reasonable compensation in case
of breach even if no actual damage is proved to have been suffered in consequence of
the breach of contract. But the expression "whether or not actual damage or loss is
proved to have been caused thereby" is intended to cover different classes of
contracts which come before the Courts. In case of breach of some contracts it may be
impossible for the Court to assess compensation arising from breach, while in other
cases compensation can be calculated in accordance with established rules. Where
the Court is unable to assess the compensation, the sum named by the parties if it be
regarded as a genuine pre- estimate may be taken into consideration as the measure
of reasonable compensation, but not if the sum named is in the nature of a penalty.

Where loss in terms of money can be determined, the party claiming compensation
must prove the loss suffered by him.......
......In the present case, it was possible for the Government of India to lead evidence
to prove the rates at which potatoes, poultry, eggs and fish were purchased by them
when the plaintiff failed to deliver "regularly and fully" the quantities stipulated
under the terms of the contracts and after the contracts were terminated. They could
have proved the rates at which they had to be purchased and also the other incidental
charges incurred by them in procuring the goods contracted for. But no such attempt
was made."
In Saw Pipes Ltd (supra), the respondent offered to supply casing pipes to the appellant, who
accepted the offer and issued a detailed order containing terms and conditions of which the goods
were to be supplied on or before 14th November, 1996. The contract provided for payment of
liquidity damages to the appellant. After referring to Sections 73 and 74 of the Contract Act,
Supreme Court, inter alia, observed as under:
"Under Section 73, when a contract has been broken, the party who suffers by such
breach is entitled to receive compensation for any loss caused to him which the
parties knew when they made the contract to be likely to result from the breach of it.
This Section is to be read with Section 74, which deals with penalty stipulated in the
contract, inter alia [relevant for the present case] provides that when a contract has
been broken, if a sum is named in the contract as the amount to be paid in case of
such breach, the party complaining of breach is entitled, whether or not actual loss is
proved to have been caused, thereby to receive from the party who has broken the
contract reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so named. Section 74
emphasizes that in case of breach of contract, the party complaining of the breach is
entitled to receive reasonable compensation whether or not actual loss is proved to
have been caused by such breach. Therefore, the emphasis is on reasonable
compensation. If the compensation named in the contract is by way of penalty,
consideration would be different and the party is only entitled to reasonable
compensation for the loss suffered. But if the compensation named in the contract for
such breach is genuine pre-estimate of loss which the parties knew when they made
the contract to be likely to result from the breach of it, there is no question of proving
such loss or such party is not required to lead evidence to prove actual loss suffered
by him. Burden is on the other party to lead evidence for proving that no loss is likely
to occur by such breach. Take for illustration: if the parties have agreed to purchase
cotton bales and the same were only to be kept as a stock-in-trade. Such bales are not
delivered on the due date and thereafter the bales are delivered beyond the stipulated
time, hence there is breach of the contract. Question which would arise for
consideration is--whether by such breach party has suffered any loss. If the price of
cotton bales fluctuated during that time, loss or gain could easily be proved. But if
cotton bales are to be purchased for manufacturing yarn, consideration would be
different (emphasis supplied) ....Take for illustration construction of a road or a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/258211/ 14M/S. Herbicides (India) Ltd. vs M/S. Shashank Pesticides P.Ltd. on 13 May, 2011
bridge. If there is delay in completing the construction of road or bridge within
stipulated time, then it would be difficult to prove how much loss is suffered by the
Society/State. Similarly in the present case, delay took place in deployment of rigs
and on that basis actual production of gas from platform B- 121 had to be changed. It
is undoubtedly true that the witness has stated that redeployment plan was made
keeping in mind several constraints including shortage of casing pipes. Arbitral
Tribunal, therefore, took into consideration the aforesaid statement volunteered by
the witness that shortage of casing pipes was only one of the several reasons and not
the only reason which led to change in deployment of plan or redeployment of rigs
Trident-II platform B-121. In our view, in such a contract, it would be difficult to
prove exact loss or damage which the parties suffer because of the breach thereof. In
such a situation, if the parties have pre-
estimated such loss after clear understanding, it would be totally unjustified to arrive
at the conclusion that party who has committed breach of the contract is not liable to
pay compensation. It would be against the specific provisions of Section 73 and 74 of
the Indian Contract Act. There was nothing on record that compensation
contemplated by the parties was in any way unreasonable."
In para 69 of the judgment, the Court, inter alia, concluded as under:
"(1) Terms of the contract are required to be taken into consideration before arriving
at the conclusion whether the party claiming damages is entitled to the same;
(2) If the terms are clear and unambiguous stipulating the liquidated damages in case
of the breach of the contract unless it is held that such estimate of
damages/compensation is unreasonable or is by way of penalty, party who has
committed the breach is required to pay such compensation and that is what is
provided in Section 73 of the Contract Act.
(3) Section 74 is to be read along with Section 73 and, therefore, in every case of
breach of contract, the person aggrieved by the breach is not required to prove actual
loss or damage suffered by him before he can claim a decree. The Court is competent
to award reasonable compensation in case of breach even if no actual damage is
proved to have been suffered in consequence of the breach of a contract.
(4) In some contracts, it would be impossible for the Court to assess the
compensation arising from breach and if the compensation contemplated is not by
way of penalty or unreasonable, Court can award the same if it is genuine pre-
estimate by the parties as the measure of reasonable compensation."
In BSNL (supra), the contract between the parties provided for payment of liquidity damages to the
appellant. On the question as to whether a sum named in the contract is a pre-estimate of
reasonable compensation for the loss or by way of penalty, Supreme Court referred to the following
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/258211/ 15M/S. Herbicides (India) Ltd. vs M/S. Shashank Pesticides P.Ltd. on 13 May, 2011
extract from Law of Contract (10th Edn.):
"a payment stipulated as in terrorem of the offending party to force him to perform
the contract. If, on the other hand, the clause is an attempt to estimate in advance the
loss which will result from the breach, it is a liquidated damages clause. The question
whether a clause is penal or pre-estimate of damages depends on its construction and
on the surrounding circumstances at the time of entering into the contract".
As regards the liquidity damages, the Court observed as under:
"Lastly, it may be noted that liquidated damages serve the useful purpose of avoiding
litigation and promoting commercial certainty and, therefore, the court should not be
astute to categorize as penalties the clauses described as liquidated damages. This
principle is relevant to regulatory regimes. It is important to bear in mind that while
categorizing damages as "penal" or "liquidated 68 damages", one must keep in mind
the concept of pricing of these contracts and the level playing field provided to the
operators because it is on costing and pricing that the loss to BSNL is measured and,
therefore, all calls during the relevant period have to be seen."
18. It would be appropriate to notice here that in the case of Maula Bux vs. UOI (supra) the contract
between the parties was for supply of goods to the government and therefore loss of the government
on account of non-supply of the goods could have been easily proved by the government as was also
noted by Supreme Court. In ONGC vs. Saw Pipes Ltd (supra) the contract pertained to supply of
pipes required for deployment of rigs which were to be used for production of gas and the plan for
redeployment and a revised plan had to be made for deployment of rigs on account of various
constraints including shortage of casing pipes which were to be supplied by Saw Pipes Ltd. and
shortage of casing pipes being only one of the several reasons leading to delay in deployment of rigs,
the actual damages on account of delay in supply of casing pipes could not have been ascertained by
the Court. In BSNL vs. Reliance Communication Ltd. (supra), there was an interconnection
agreement between the parties which provided for payment of liquidated damages and considering
that the telecom services in India are operating under regulatory regime where all service providers
are to be afforded level playing field. The Court was of the view that the compensation claimed by
BSNL was pre-estimate of damages and was not penal in nature.
19. In Shiva Jute Baling Ltd vs. Hindley and Company Ltd, AIR 1959 SC 1357, the appellant
company entered into a contract with the respondent company for supply of 500 bales of jute. The
contract proved that in the event of default of tender or delivery, the seller shall pay to the buyer as
and for liquidated damages, Rs 10 per ton plus the excess (if any) of the market value over the
contract price, the market value being that of jute contracted for on the day following the date of
default. On the appellant taking the stand that the contract had stood cancelled, the respondent
claimed default on the part of the appellant and the matter was referred for arbitration. Upholding
the compensation awarded by the Arbitrator in terms of the contract between the parties, Supreme
Court, inter alia, observed as under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/258211/ 16M/S. Herbicides (India) Ltd. vs M/S. Shashank Pesticides P.Ltd. on 13 May, 2011
"The argument under this head is that the liquidated damages provided under clause
(12) of the contract include not only the difference between the contract price and the
market price on the date of default but also a further sum of 10s. per ton. Reference
in this connection is made to Sections 73 and 74 of the Indian Contract Act, and it is
said that the extra amount of 10s. per ton included in the sum of liquidated damages
is against the provision of these section and therefore the award being against the law
of India is bad on the face of it and should not be enforced in India. Section 73
provides for compensation for loss or damage caused by breach of contract. It lays
down that when a contract has been broken, the party who suffers by such breach is
entitled to receive from the party who has broken the contract, compensation for any
loss or damage caused to him thereby, which naturally arose in the usual course of
things from such breach, or which the parties knew, when they made the contract, to
be likely to result from the breach of it. Section 74 provides for breach of contract
where penalty is stipulated for or a sum is named and lays down that when a contract
has been broken, if a sum is named in the contract as the amount to be paid in case of
such breach, or if the contract contains any other stipulation by way of penalty, the
party complaining of the breach is entitled, whether or not actual damage or loss is
proved to have been caused thereby, to receive from the party who has broken the
contract reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so named or, as the case
may be, the penalty stipulated for. What clause (12) of the contract provides in this
case is the measure of liquidated damages and that consists of two things, namely, (i)
the difference between the contract price and the market price on the date default
and
(ii) an addition of 10s. per ton above that. There is nothing in s. 73 or s. 74 of the
contract Act, which makes the award of such liquidated damages illegal. Assuming
that the case is covered by s. 74, it is provided therein that reasonable compensation
may be awarded for breach of contract subject to the maximum amount named in the
contract. What the arbitrators have done is to award the maximum amount named in
the contract. If the appellant wanted to challenge the reasonableness of that provision
in clause (12) it should have appeared before the arbitrators and represented its case.
It cannot now be heard to say that simply because clause (12) provided for a further
sum of 10s. per ton over and above the difference between the contract price and the
market price on the date of the default, this was per se unreasonable and was
therefore bad accordingly to the law of India as laid down in Sections 73 and 74 of the
Contract Act. Both these sections provide for reasonable compensation and s. 74
contemplates that the maximum reasonable compensation may be the amount which
may be named in the contract. In this case the arbitrators have awarded the
maximum amount so named and nothing more. Their award in the circumstances
cannot be said to be bad on the face of it, nor can it be said to be against the law of
India as contained in these sections of the Contract Act."
20. The propositions of law which emerge from the statutory provisions contained in Section 73 &
74 of the Indian Contract Act when examined in the light of a cumulative reading of aforesaid
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/258211/ 17M/S. Herbicides (India) Ltd. vs M/S. Shashank Pesticides P.Ltd. on 13 May, 2011
decisions of Supreme Court can be summarized as under:
a) If a party to the contract commits breach of the contract, the party who suffers loss/damage on
account of such breach is entitled to receive such compensation from the party in breach of the
contract which naturally arose in usual course of business, on account of such breach or which the
parties to the contract knew, at the time of making the contract, to be likely to result on account of
its breach. However, the party suffering on account of the breach is entitled to recover only such loss
or damage which arose directly and is not entitled to damages which can be said to be remote.
b) In case the agreement between the parties provides for payment of liquidated damages, the party
suffering on account of breach of the contract even if it does not prove the actual loss/damage
suffered by it, is entitled to reasonable damages unless it is proved that no loss or damage was
caused on account of breach of the contract. In such a case, the amount of reasonable damages
cannot exceed the amount of liquidated damages stipulated in the contract.
Any other interpretation would render the words "whether or not actual damage or loss is proved to
have been caused thereby" appearing in Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act absolutely redundant
and therefore the Court needs to eschew such an interpretation.
c) If the amount stipulated in the contract, for payment by party in breach of the contract, to the
party suffering on account of breach of the contract is shown to be by way of penalty, the party
suffering on account of the breach is entitled only to a reasonable compensation and not the amount
stipulated in the contract. If it is shown by the party in breach of the contract that no loss or damage
was suffered by the other party on account of breach of the contract, the party in breach of the
contract is not liable to pay any amount as compensation to the other party.
d) If the nature of the contract between the parties is such that it is not reasonably possibly to assess
the damages suffered on account of breach of the contract, the amount stipulated in the contract, for
payment by the party in breach should normally be accepted as a fair and reasonable pre-estimate of
damages likely to be suffered on account of breach of the contract and should be awarded.
21. In the case before this Court, though the plaintiff company has not proved the actual damages
suffered by it on account of breach of contract by defendant No.1 company it cannot be disputed that
some loss or damage was definitely suffered by the plaintiff company on account of the breach. No
evidence has been led by defendant No.1 to prove that either on account of increase in price of raw
material/finished goods or for some other reason the plaintiff company did not suffer any loss on
account of the failure of defendant No.1 to lift the balance quantity of 93,000 litres. As noted earlier,
the facts and the circumstances of the case including the letters written by the plaintiff company to
defendant No.1 from time to time, coupled with the deposition of PW-1 Shri Ashok Dugar, clearly
show that the plaintiff company had either procured the requisite raw material or had produced the
finished product, may be to the extent of 53,000 litres if not 93,000 litres. Vide its letter dated 21st
October, 1995 (Exh. PW- 1/4) plaintiff company had written to defendant No.1 that since the
product agreed to be supplied to it was required for application in wheat crop in north India and if it
is not disposed then, it will have to be stocked for next year and therefore, there should not be any
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/258211/ 18M/S. Herbicides (India) Ltd. vs M/S. Shashank Pesticides P.Ltd. on 13 May, 2011
doubt left about their lifting the entire quantity. The plaintiff company went to the extent of
requesting defendant No.1 company to re-assess and let it know if defendant wished them to reduce
any quantity. In its reply dated 26.10.1995 Exh. (P-2 D1 and D4) defendant No.1 did not dispute that
if the contract goods were not lifted by it, the plaintiff company would have to carry the same for one
year. In its letter dated 17.11.1995 (Exh. P-5 D1 & D4) which is an admitted document, defendant
No.1 company itself informed the plaintiff company that the season had miserably failed, the market
had crashed and therefore they were not in a position to make any commitment for lifting or making
financial arrangement. Therefore it cannot be disputed that the goods agreed to be sold by the
plaintiff to defendant No.1 were seasonal in nature and if they were not sold by December, 1995 the
plaintiff company had necessarily to carry the inventory upto next season. If the plaintiff company
did not manufacture any goods other than 7000 litres supplied by it to defendant No.1, it would
have stored the raw material procured by it till next season when it would have utilized it for
manufacturing the finished product. The plaintiff company in such a case, suffered damages on
account of interest which it paid or it could have earned on the amount paid for procurement of raw
material and would also have incurred cost in storing that raw material for about one year. If the
plaintiff company had manufactured the remaining 93,000 litres of finished product, it was
deprived of use of the money which defendant No.1 company would have paid to it in case it had not
committed breach of the contract and thereby it incurred loss of interest on the amount which it
would have received from defendant No.1 company besides incurring expenditure on storage of
finished products. If the plaintiff company partly manufactured the finished product and had to
store them upto the next year along with the raw material required for production of the remaining
quantity of the finished product, the plaintiff company suffered a loss on account of expenditure
incurred in storage of the finished product and raw material besides loss of interest on the amount
paid by it for the raw material. Even if I take a conservative interest @ 12% p.a. the plaintiff
company would have suffered loss of about Rs.10 per litre besides the expenditure incurred on
storage of raw material/finished product for about one year. In these circumstances, it can hardly be
disputed that the plaintiff company is entitled to recover at least Rs.10 per litre from defendant No.1
company by way of damages for the loss suffered by it due to breach of contract on the part of
defendant No.1 company.
22. It was contended by the learned Counsel for the defendants that it was incumbent upon the
plaintiff company to make efforts to mitigate the losses and no evidence has been produced to prove
any such effort. In support of his contention he has relied upon Pannalal Jugatmal vs. State of
Madhya Pradesh AIR 1963 MP 242 and Firm Bhagwandas Shobhala Jain, a Registered Fir, and Anr.
vs. State fo Madhya Pradesh AIR 1966 MP 95. In the case of Pannalal (supra) the Court was
concerned with a case attracting Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act and not a case to which the
provisions of Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act applied. During the course of the judgment the
Court referring to Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act observed as under:
14. Now, the rule is that damages are compensatory and no penal and that one who has suffered loss
fro breach of contract must take every reasonable step that is available to him to mitigate the extent
of damages caused by the breach. He cannot claim tobe compensated by the party in default for loss
which is really due not to the breach but to his own failure to behave reasonably after the breach.
This rule is incorporated in the explanation to Section 73 of the Contract Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/258211/ 19M/S. Herbicides (India) Ltd. vs M/S. Shashank Pesticides P.Ltd. on 13 May, 2011
In case of Bhagwandas (Supra) which again was a case attracting applicability of Section 73 of the
Indian Contract Act, the Court interalia observed as under:
33. It has also to be remembered that the law imposes a duty upon the plaintiffs to
take all reasonable steps to mitigate the loss caused by a breach of contract and
debars him from claiming compensation for any part of the damages which is due to
his neglect to do so;....................
However, in the case before this Court since admittedly the goods were seasonal in nature and
therefore could not have been disposed of till next year, it cannot be said that the plaintiff company
could have disposed them of soon after there was breach of contract on the part of defendant No.1.
Moreover, since the market had crashed and there were no buyers in the marked for the product as
is evident from the letter written by defendant No.1 to the plaintiff on 17.11.1995, the plaintiff
company would not have been in a position to sell the goods manufactured by it on the instructions
of defendant No.1 company at a remunerative price. Even if the plaintiff company had not
manufactured the finished goods, it would not have been possible for it to sell the raw material
procured by it, at the same price at which it was procured. The raw material meant for manufacture
of seasonal goods could not have fetched a ready buyer at the cost price of the plaintiff company, in
case it could not have been consumed for about a year.
Since there was no breach of contract on the part of the plaintiff, defendant no.1 is not entitled to
recover any amount from it and the counter claim is therefore liable to be dismissed. The plaintiff
company on the other hand is entitled to recover a sum of Rs.9,30,000/- though only from
defendant No.1 company as damages @ Rs.10 per litre. The issues are decided accordingly.
23. In view of my findings above, I hold that defendant No.1 is not entitled to any interest from the
plaintiff.
24. The plaintiff has claimed interest @ 18% p.a. on the price of 7000 litres of the finished product
which it had supplied to defendant No.1 company. No agreement between the parties for payment of
interest has either been pleaded or proved by the plaintiff. However, since this is a suit for price of
goods sold and delivered, interest can be awarded to the plaintiff under Section 61(2) of the Sales of
Goods Act. Considering the nature of transaction between the parties, I am of the view that interest
should be awarded to the plaintiff company @ 12% p.a. Calculated on the aforesaid rate, the amount
of interest comes to Rs.93,008/-. The plaintiff is entitled to recover the aforesaid amount from
defendant No.1 as interest. The issue is decided accordingly.
Relief
25. In view of my findings on other issues defendant No.1 is not entitled to recover any amount from
the plaintiff. The plaintiff however, is entitled to recover a total sum of Rs.11,14,160/-from defendant
No.1 company alone.
