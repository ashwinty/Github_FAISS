3. The present petitioner raises the following
Fundamental Questions of Law before this Hon'ble Court under article 226 and 227 of the
Constitution of India, along with the relevant provisions of consumer Protection Act:
a). That a Consumer complaint No. 30 of 2016 was filed before the District consumer grievance and
redressal forum, Bhuj, alleging various illegalities to have been committed by the firm Mahavir
Developers, and subsequently Hanumant Developers. That pursuant to the said Consumer
complaint No. 30 of 2016 filed before the District consumer redressal forum, Bhuj; the learned
forum was pleased to pass an order dated 01.10.2016 NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020
JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined whereby an order was passed against the present
petitioner,
b). That because of the reasons beyond the control of the present petitioner, the petitioner in due
time could not file the Appeal challenging the said order; and at the same he could not comply with
the order aforesaid order dated. 01.10.2016. However, it is reiterated that it was not with an
intention to disobey the orders but circumstantially it was impossible for the petitioner to comply
with the orders/direction of the district forum.
c). That pursuant to the passing of the order dated 01.10.2016, by the District consumer grievance
and redressal forum, Bhuj, as the respondents had allegedly failed to comply with the order of the
learned forum, and enforcement application under Section 25 of the Consumer Protection Act was
filed by the complainant of the Consumer complaint No. 30 of 2016, also known as "Tamil
Arji/Darkhast", vide the Application dated 23.11.2016. That because the petitioner of the present
petition had changed the residences from Kutch to Anand, the summonses issued to the present
petitioner NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023
undefined under Section 25 of the Consumer Disputes Redressal Act were not served upon the
present petitioner and therefore the learned forum was constrained to issue non-bailable warrants
under the various cases pending against the present petitioner and the other developers of the same
firm in the joint capacity. That the said warrant was served upon the present petitioner and he was
detained under the said warrant which was issued to him originally under Section 25 of the
Consumer Protection Act, and he was further transferred into the custody of jail superintendent at
Palara, Bhuj and Kutch.
d). That the present petitioner was taken into the custody under the Jail superintendent, Palara,
Kutch Bhuj, and thereafter one application was moved by the a complainant in some Other
Enforcement Application, requesting the learned District consumer grievance at redressal forum,
Bhuj and Kutch to exercise the powers under Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act (which
would be impermissible in the eyes of law and would also be demonstrated to the Hon'ble Court);
however, while exercising the powers under Section 27, the present petitioner was ordered to be
taken into custody.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34397750/ 5Rameshbhai Bhagwanjibhai ... vs State Of Gujarat on 20 July, 2023
NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined Section
25 of the Consumer Protection Act was filed by the complainant of the Consumer complaint No. 30
of
e). That the present petitioner under the impression that the exercise of the powers by the District
Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum, under Section 27 was appropriate, he had made an
application in the Enforcement Proceedings No. 77 of 2017 whereby he prayed to be released on bail.
f). Thereafter, the Ld. Consumer Forum had passed order dated.17.03.2018, Wherein the present
petition had been sent to the judicial custody for the uncertain time. Therefore the present
petitioner had approached before this Hon'ble Court challenging the order dated.17.03.2018 by
filing Special Civil Application being No. 2885 of 2019. and thereafter by considering the facts of the
case and circumstances of the case this Hon'ble Court directed to the Concern Jail Authority to
release the present petitioner as the Order dated.17.03.2018 passed under section 27 of Consumer
Protection Act is illegal and further passed order that when application under Section 25 of the
Consumer Protection Act has been filed Section NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020
JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined 27 power can not be exercised by way of passing order
dated. 03.05.2019.
g). That Even after cristal clear direction has been given by this Hon'ble Court the Ld. Consumer
Forum keeps exercising power under Section 27, when the application has been filed under Section
25 of the Consumer Protection Act. Therefore, the present petitioner had filed the Criminal Misc.
Application No.1 of 2019 in Special Criminal Application No. 11142 of 2018 (Main Matter) for
Clarification of the main order dated. 03.05.2019, and this Hon'ble Court had clarified order as
stated under on 29.11.2019.
h). That the present petitioner is in no financial capacity to comply with the order of the District
Consumer Forum, however there is no willful disobedience of the order dated. 01.10.2016, by the
present petitioner. It must here be noted that the petitioner has offered to give his land instead of
hard cash in due compliance of the order; a copy of the purshish dated.23.10.2019 submitted in
support of the contention.
NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined
i). Hence, the present application is preferred.
4. Heard learned advocate Mr. Aaditya D. Bhatt for the petitioner and Mr. Soaham Joshi, learned
Assistant Public Prosecutor (APP) for and on behalf of respondent No.1 - State.
Though served, none chosen to appear for and on behalf of respondent No.2 - original complainant
in the respective petitions. Hence, the matter is taken up for final disposal of the present
petition/(s). 5.1 Learned advocate Mr. Aaditya D. Bhatt, representing the petitioner, has argued that
the moot question involved in the current petition, i.e., Special Criminal Application No. 1944 of
2020, pertains to the "Tamil Arji/Darkhast" (Tamil application) filed under Section 25 of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34397750/ 6Rameshbhai Bhagwanjibhai ... vs State Of Gujarat on 20 July, 2023
Consumer Protection Act, bearing Consumer Complaint No. 30 of 2016. The said Tamil Arji is
currently pending before the Consumer Forum. Due to the petitioner's change of residence from
Kuchcha to Anand, the summons issued under Section 25 of the NEUTRAL CITATION
R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined Consumer Protection Act were
not served upon the petitioner. Consequently, the Consumer Forum had to issue non-bailable
warrants against the petitioner in various cases involving both the present petitioner and other
developers jointly.
5.2 Subsequently, the warrant was served on the present petitioner, and he was detained under the
same warrant initially issued under Section 25 of the Consumer Protection Act. He was then
transferred into the custody of Jail Superintendent, Palara, Buchcha, Khuj. Afterward, the
complainant made an application in some other Enforcement Application, requesting the District
Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum, Bhuj, to exercise the powers under Section 27 of the
Consumer Protection Act. The petitioner argues that such an application itself is not permissible in
the eyes of the law. However, while exercising the powers, the present petitioner was ordered to be
taken into custody. Subsequently, under the impression that the exercise of powers by the District
Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum, Bhuj, to exercise the powers under Section 27 of the
Consumer Protection Act was appropriate, the NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020
JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined petitioner filed an application in Enforcement
Application No. 77 of 2017, seeking release on bail. However, on 17.3.2018, the Consumer Forum
passed an order sending the petitioner to judicial custody for an uncertain time. 5.3 Challenging the
order dated 17.3.2018, the petitioner approached this Court by filing Special Civil Application No.
2885 of 2019. After considering the facts and circumstances of the case, the Hon'ble Court directed
the concerned Jail Authority to release the petitioner, as the order dated 17.3.2018, passed under
Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act, was deemed illegal. The Court also emphasized that
when an application under Section 25 of the Consumer Protection Act has been filed, the provisions
of Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act cannot be exercised, as done in the impugned order
dated 3.5.2019. Despite the clear directions given by the Hon'ble Court, the Consumer Forum
continued to exercise the power under Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act in applications
where Section 25 of the Consumer Protection Act was filed.
5.4 In light of this, the present petitioner filed Criminal Misc. Application No.1 of 2019 in the main
matter of NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined
Special Criminal Application No. 11142 of 2018, seeking clarification of the main order dated
3.5.2019. The Court provided the clarification on 29.11.2019 as stated below. The petitioner's
counsel further contends that the petitioner lacked the financial capacity to comply with the order of
the District Consumer Forum. Nevertheless, the petitioner asserts that there was no willful
disobedience of the order dated 1.10.2016 passed by the Consumer Forum on the petitioner's part.
The petitioner had offered land in lieu of hard cash to comply with the order, but the other party did
not accept it. Therefore, he has submitted that the present petition is required to be filed.
5.5 The petitioner heavily relies on the order dated 18.4.2019 passed by this Court in Special
Criminal Application No. 11142 of 2018, specifically, the observation made in para 9.1 (15.8), and
submits that the Court has explicitly stated that powers exercised under the provisions of the Civil
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34397750/ 7Rameshbhai Bhagwanjibhai ... vs State Of Gujarat on 20 July, 2023
Procedure Code cannot be exercised under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code.
5.6 Additionally, the petitioner's counsel has brought to NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020
JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined the Court's attention the further affidavit filed by the
present petitioner in related matters, specifically, Special Criminal Application No. 1973 of 2020. In
this affidavit, the petitioner has presented additional documentary evidence and copies of certain
judgments, including the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Jolly George Varghese
and Others versus The Bank of Cochin reported in AIR 1980 SC 470. Furthermore, the counsel has
relied upon the judgment of the Maharashtra State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission,
Mumbai, in the case of Amir Ali Tharani versus Rajesh Sukhtnkar and Others reported in II (2011)
CPJ 23 (Maha.), and also on the judgment of the Delhi State Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission SCDRC New Delhi, in the case of Om Prakash Bhatia versus M/s. Deepu Chits Pvt. Ltd.
and Others reported in legalcrystal.com/1114480 dated 10.2.1993.
5.7 Based on the aforementioned judgments, the counsel argues that the proceedings initiated under
Section 25 of the Consumer Protection Act, resulting in the impugned order passed under Section 27
of the Consumer Protection Act, are not permissible in the eyes of the NEUTRAL CITATION
R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined law. Consequently, the counsel
contends that the present petition should be allowed.
5.8 Moreover, the counsel submits that, considering the totality of the facts and circumstances, the
prosecution should be pursued independently and not in the proceedings where the application
under Section 25 is pending. Therefore, the impugned order is considered unjust and improper, and
the counsel urges this Court to intervene. The counsel asserts that all the petitions have been filed
based on the aforementioned contentions, and thus, this Court can simultaneously decide all the
petitions by taking into account the submissions made in the present petition for all related matters.
6.1 On the contrary, Mr. Soaham Joshi, the learned Assistant Public Prosecutor representing
respondent No. 1
- the State, has presented his arguments. He contends that the impugned order, passed by the trial
court, was issued under Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act. He directs the Court's attention
to the content of the said order, where the Consumer Forum considered that under the provisions of
Section 362 of the Criminal Procedure Code, there is a provision for summary NEUTRAL
CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined procedure, and
accordingly, the forum is bound to conduct a summary trial as the present petitioner has failed to
pay the amount to the complainant. 6.2 At the relevant point in time, the Forum passed an order
below Exh. 18, which was filed by the learned advocate for the present petitioner, seeking not to
award any sentence to the petitioner. However, at that time, the summary trial was not conducted.
Consequently, the present petition, i.e., Special Criminal Application No. 2851 of 2019, was filed,
and the learned Court ordered to conduct the trial under Section 362 of the Criminal Procedure
Code. As a result, the learned Forum issued a notice to the petitioner to give a reply or produce
evidence in defense. This order is now being challenged. 6.3 Mr. Soaham Joshi argues that it is not
disputed that this Court passed the appropriate order at the relevant time to conduct the summary
trial under Section 362 of the Cr.P.C., and accordingly, the Consumer Forum issued the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34397750/ 8Rameshbhai Bhagwanjibhai ... vs State Of Gujarat on 20 July, 2023
notice/summons to produce the reply/defense or documentary evidence related to why the
petitioner did not pay the amount to the complainant. Therefore, he contends that in the given
NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined facts and
circumstances, the petitioner has an alternative and effective remedy through an appeal before the
State Consumer Commission under Section 17 read with Section 19 of the Consumer Protection Act.
Hence, the present petition cannot be entertained. 6.4 Furthermore, he asserts that the impugned
order is not in contravention of any provisions of the Consumer Protection Act and is, in fact, in
accordance with the powers under Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act. Therefore, he submits
that the present petition(s) merit dismissal, as they lack substance, and the petitioner, who is the
defaulter, has not paid the substantial amount to the complainants in the consumer complaints even
after the order passed by the Consumer Forum in their respective complaints. Considering this
conduct, he maintains that the present petition(s) must be dismissed. 7.1 I have heard rival
submissions made at the bar by the respective parties. I have perused the earlier order passed by
this Court. I have considered the impugned order in the respective petitions.
7.2 7.2 The learned Assistant Public Prosecutor's NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020
JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined submission is indeed compelling. The impugned
order appears to be a result of conducting a summary trial under Section 362 of the Criminal
Procedure Code, which was directed in Special Criminal Application No. 2851 of 2019. Moreover,
the record indicates that there are judgments and orders passed in Consumer Complaint No. 30 of
2016 in Special Criminal Application No. 1944 of 2020 (Tamil Arzi No. 77 of 2016 - Execution
Petition) dated 5.8.2019. In light of these circumstances, it is pertinent to refer to the provisions of
Sections 17, 19, 25, and 27 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, as follows:
"Section 17 in the Consumer Protection Act, 1986:-
17. Jurisdiction of the State Commission.-- (1) Subject to the other provisions of this
Act, the State Commission shall have jurisdiction--
(a) to entertain--
(i) complaints where the value of the goods or services and compensation, if any,
claimed 2[exceeds rupees twenty lakhs but does not exceed rupees one crore];
and
(ii) appeals against the orders of any District Forum within the State; and NEUTRAL
CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined
(b) to call for the records and pass appropriate orders in any consumer dispute which
is pending before or has been decided by any District Forum within the State, where
it appears to the State Commission that such District Forum has exercised a
jurisdiction not vested in it by law, or has failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested or
has acted in exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34397750/ 9Rameshbhai Bhagwanjibhai ... vs State Of Gujarat on 20 July, 2023
(2) A complaint shall be instituted in a State Commission within the limits of whose
jurisdiction,--
(a) the opposite party or each of the opposite parties, where there are more than one,
at the time of the institution of the complaint, actually and voluntarily resides or
carries on business or has a branch office or personally works for gain; or
(b) any of the opposite parties, where there are more than one, at the time of the
institution of the complaint, actually and voluntarily resides, or carries on business or
has a branch office or personally works for gain, provided that in such case either the
permission of the State Commission is given or the opposite parties who do not reside
or carry on business or have a branch office or personally works for gain, as the case
may be, acquiesce in such institution; or
(c) the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises.
NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined Section
19 in the Consumer Protection Act, 1986:-
19. Appeals. - Any person aggrieved by an order made by the State Commission in exercise of its
powers conferred by sub-clause
(i) of clause
(a) of section 17 may prefer an appeal against such order to the National Commission within a
period of thirty days from the date of the order in such form and manner as may be prescribed:
Provided that the National Commission may entertain an appeal after the expiry of the said period
of thirty days if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period:
Provided further that no appeal by a person, who is required to pay any amount in terms of an order
of the State Commission, shall be entertained by the National Commission unless the appellant has
deposited in the prescribed manner fifty per cent. of the amount or rupees thirty-five thousand,
whichever is less. Section 25 in the Consumer Protection Act, 1986:-
25. Enforcement of orders of the District Forum, the State Commission or the National
Commission.-- (1) Where an interim order made under this Act is not complied with, the District
Forum or the State Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be, may order the
property of the person, not complying with such order to NEUTRAL CITATION
R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined be attached.
(2) No attachment made under sub-section (1) shall remain in force for more than three months at
the end of which, if the non-compliance continues, the property attached may be sold and out of the
proceeds thereof, the District Forum or the State Commission or the National Commission may
award such damages as it thinks fit to the complainant and shall pay the balance, if any, to the party
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34397750/ 10Rameshbhai Bhagwanjibhai ... vs State Of Gujarat on 20 July, 2023
entitled thereto. (3) Where any amount is due from any person under an order made by a District
Forum, State Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be, the person entitled to
the amount may make an application to the District Forum, the State Commission or the National
Commission, as the case may be, and such District Forum or the State Commission or the National
Commission may issue a certificate for the said amount to the Collector of the district (by whatever
name called) and the Collector shall proceed to recover the amount in the same manner as arrears of
land revenue.
Section 27 in the Consumer Protection Act, 1986:-
27. Penalties:-
(1) Where a trader or a person against whom a complaint is made or the complainant fails or omits
to comply with any order made by the District Forum, the State Commission or NEUTRAL
CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined the National
Commission, as the case may be, such trader or person 96 [or complainant] shall be punishable with
imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one month but which may extend to three
years, or with fine which shall not be less than two thousands rupees but which may extend to ten
thousand rupees, or with both: (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), the District Forum or the State Commission or the National
Commission, as the case may be, shall have the power of a Judicial Magistrate of the first class for
the trial of offences under this Act, and on such conferment of powers, the District Forum or the
State Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be, on whom the powers are so
conferred, shall be deemed to be a Judicial Magistrate of the first class for the purpose of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974). (3) All offences under this Act may be tried summarily by the
District Forum or the State Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be."
7.3 Upon considering the relevant provisions, it is evident that the impugned order was passed by
the Consumer Forum, exercising its powers under the Consumer Protection Act, as the petitioner
failed to NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined
comply with the direction to pay the amount to the complainants in the Consumer Complaints.
There are multiple petitions filed before this Court where various individuals have not received
payment from the petitioner, arising from different complaints. The petitioner's conduct speaks
volume for itself, indicating a reluctance to pay any amount and engaging in repetitive petitions with
hyper-technical defenses, seemingly with the intention to harass the complainants and avoid paying
the due compensation.
7.4 The records show that a remedy is available under Section 19 of the Consumer Protection Act
since the Consumer Forum has already passed the order. Therefore, an appeal is provided under the
said Act, and if the petitioner is aggrieved by the impugned order, he should have preferred an
appeal before the concerned State Commission instead of filing Special Criminal Application No.
1944 of 2020. In light of the alternative and efficacious remedy available under the law, I am of the
opinion that the present petition need not be entertained. The Consumer Protection Act is intended
to be beneficial legislation, and the benefits of the Act NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34397750/ 11Rameshbhai Bhagwanjibhai ... vs State Of Gujarat on 20 July, 2023
JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined should be extended to aggrieved consumers as
expeditiously as possible. However, the present petitioner has managed to evade liability since 2016,
even though the complainants obtained judgment in the same year, and until 2023, they have been
deprived of the fruits of that judgment.
7.5 It is observed that prima facie the present petition itself is not maintainable due to the existence
of an alternative and efficacious remedy. Despite this, the contention is raised that the proceedings
under Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act cannot be initiated in the proceedings filed under
Section 25 of the Consumer Protection Act.
7.6 Considering the same and also considering the judgment cited at the bar by the learned advocate
for the petitioner, more particularly, the judgment passed by the Maharashtra State Consumer
Disputes Redressal Commission, Mumbai in the case of Amir Ali Tharani (supra), specifically,
paragraphs 37 and 38 of that judgment are relevant, as under:
NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined "37.
Thus, on reading sections 4&5, it is clear that the Consumer Fora which are constituted as deemed
Judicial Magistrate of the first class for the purposes of the Code of Criminal Procedure to try the
offences under this Act are dealing with the offences under any other law than the Indian Penal
Code when they are exercising powers under section 27 of Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Section
27(1) makes out and states the offence and the punishment for the said offence. It also states that
who can be punished and who can punish. Sub-section (2) of section 27 as stated earlier, gives
power to try the offence under this Act and the status of Judicial Magistrate of the first class to
Consumer Fora for the purposes of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Therefore, reading these
provisions along with Sections 4(2)&5 of Code of Criminal Procedure, the Consumer Fora being a
Judicial Magistrate of the first class has to follow the procedure as provided in the Code of Criminal
Procedure, however, subject to any enactment for the time being in force regulating the manner or
place of investigating, inquiring into, trying or otherwise dealing with such offences. It has been also
declared by Section 5 of Code of Criminal Procedure that nothing contained in this Code shall, in the
absence of specific provision to the contrary, affect any special or local law for the time being in
force, or any special NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023
undefined jurisdiction or power conferred, or any special form of procedure prescribed, by any other
law for the time being in force. So, on reading these provisions it follows that the procedure as
provided in the Code of Criminal Procedure is required to be followed subject to and without
affecting to the procedure as provided in any special or local law or any special jurisdiction or power
conferred or any special form of procedure prescribed by any other law for the time being in force.
In short, the procedure as provided in the special law will prevail upon and will modify the
procedure as provided in the Code of Criminal procedure to the extent as is stated in the special law
and the special law will prevail to the extent of provisions as provided in the special law as against
the General Criminal Procedure Code. Thus, looking to the provisions of section 27 (2)&(3) of the
Act, at the cost of repetition, it is held that the Consumer Fora being a deemed Judicial Magistrate of
the first class for the purpose of Code of Criminal Procedure shall have the powers of Judicial
Magistrate of the first class for the trial of offence under this Act and said deemed Judicial
Magistrate of the first class shall try offence under this Act summarily. In view of this, Chapter XX &
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34397750/ 12Rameshbhai Bhagwanjibhai ... vs State Of Gujarat on 20 July, 2023
XXI of Code of Criminal Procedure will be applicable to trial under section 27. Chapter XXI deals
with summary trials by a Criminal Court and NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020
JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined therefore section 260 & 265 will have to be followed
by the Consumer Fora while exercising powers of Judicial Magistrate of the first class under section
27. Section 262 which provides for procedure for summary trial states that the procedure specified
for trial of summons-case shall be followed except as hereinafter mentioned. In view of this, Chapter
XX of Code of Criminal Procedure deals with the trial of summons- cases by Magistrate may equally
apply. However, any part of these provisions, namely, Chapter XX & XXI, which are otherwise than
the special procedure provided under section 27 (2)&(3) shall not be followed. For example, section
262 sub-section (2) provides no sentence of imprisonment for a term exceeding three months shall
be passed in the case of any conviction under this Chapter. Therefore, a query may raise, if the
procedure as provided under this Chapter is to be followed, conviction exceeding three months
cannot be granted. Since this provision is otherwise than the conviction provided under section 27
(1) will not be applicable in view of provisions of section 4(2) & (5) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, referred to above. Therefore, reading sub-section (2) & (3) of section 27, we find that
only these provisions as incorporated in Chapter XX & XXI are applicable for the trial of the case.
However, trial of the case is one part and dealing with the case is another part from its NEUTRAL
CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined inception. The
power of trial is given and so also the Consumer Fora have been made Judicial Magistrate of the first
class for the purposes of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In short, therefore, accepting the
limitation and procedure in sub-section (2) & (3) of section 27 and subject to these provisions, other
provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure will be applicable for dealing with the application
under section 27 by the Consumer Fora. It is to be noted that section 29 (2) of Code of Criminal
Procedure which states the power of Judicial Magistrate of the first class provides that he may pass a
sentence of imprisonment for not exceeding three years, or of fine not exceeding 10,000/-, or both,
the said provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure and the provision as contained under section
27(1) providing power of punishment is one and the same. Thus, what we find that to the extent of
difference in the procedure, Code of Criminal Procedure will not be applicable and in that
circumstances, procedure and provisions as provided in the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 will
survive as it is other law or a special law providing for the offences and trial of offences. Same will be
a position while dealing with appeal under Section 27-A of Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
38. In the result, following procedure is required to NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020
JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined be followed in an application under section 27 i.e.
whenever the application under section 27 is presented by the applicant, the Consumer Fora shall
satisfy itself on examination or verification that there is failure or omission to obey the order of
Consumer Fora by opponent and shall take a cognizance under section 190 of Code of Criminal
Procedure and shall issue summons process for the appearance of accused/opponent along with
copy of application. After summons is served on the other side, namely, opponent/accused, he shall
appear before the Consumer Fora alias Judicial Magistrate of the first class and shall submit an
application for the purpose of getting a bail so as to secure the presence and attendance of the
opponent/accused. If on the date of first appearance, opponent remains absent, the Consumer Fora
may consider to pass an order for bailable warrant to secure the presence. If on the first date,
opponent/accused appears either personally or through Advocate and if it is not possible to proceed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34397750/ 13Rameshbhai Bhagwanjibhai ... vs State Of Gujarat on 20 July, 2023
for summary trial as provided under the Act, opponent/accused shall submit an application for bail
and the said application shall be dealt with by the Consumer Fora on its own merits. However, the
Consumer Fora will keep in mind that the bail is rule and jail is exception and thus, consider the
application for bail. If after grant of bail, opponent/accused NEUTRAL CITATION
R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined furnished personal bond and
surety as directed by the Consumer Fora, same shall be accepted by the Consumer Fora as Judicial
Magistrate of the first class and the forms of PR Bond and Surety as provided under the Code of
Criminal Procedure may be followed. If for whatever reasons, the opponent/accused is not
possessed of surety along with him on the first day of appearance, then, the opponent/accused may
submit an application to release him on execution of PR Bond and further requesting to grant time
for furnishing the surety of the bail. Such application may be considered by the Consumer Fora in its
discretion in accordance with law. The Consumer Fora shall see that before the next date, bail bonds
are executed. If it finds after service of summons and/or after the appearance and execution of PR
Bond and/or bail as surety, opponent/accused remained absent, the Consumer Fora acting as
Judicial Magistrate of the first class may issue a bailable warrant and if at that time only PR Bond
has been executed may forfeit the PR Bond and proceed for recovery of said amount. If, on that date,
it is found that bail bond has already been executed but the opponent/accused is absent, the
Consumer Fora acting as the Judicial Magistrate of the first class may issue notices to the sureties to
secure presence of the opponent/accused and equally to show-cause why the amount of bail shall
not be forfeited and recovered NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED:
20/07/2023 undefined from the sureties. If the sureties secured the presence of the
opponent/accused and/or opponent/accused himself appeared and/or is brought under bailable
warrant, the Consumer Fora may consider as to whether further the opponent/accused shall be kept
on bail or not. The Consumer Fora has also to keep in mind that these cases under section 27 shall
not be treated as regular criminal trials, but they shall try to deal with these cases in the summary
manner as provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure Chapter XX & XXI and therefore, instead
of allowing the opponent/accused protracting the criminal trial either by remaining absent and/or
by any other method, the Consumer Fora while acting as Judicial Magistrate of the first class under
section 27 shall be diligent and prompt to conclude the summary trial as provided under Chapter
XX & XXI. It is to be noted that in proceeding under section 27, it is not expected that
opponent/accused shall explain by filing a reply as to why he could not comply with the order. Such
procedure is not contemplated in the Criminal Court. Therefore, by following the procedure as early
as possible, the Consumer Fora shall explain the substance of accusation to the opponent/accused as
provided under section 251 and shall record a plea of guilt and thereafter follow the procedure as
stated in section 263 & 264 and deliver a judgement as provided under NEUTRAL CITATION
R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined section 265. This procedure is
required to be followed. We have noticed that such procedure is not followed. Instead, the
Consumer Fora go on liberally granting time to the opponent/accused and thus cases are pending
for years together. We have also noted that some of the District Consumer Forums go on accepting
part payments instead of concluding a trial as expected under section 27 of the Act. Section 27
contemplates a total compliance of the order. It is a criminal action, so as to have deterrent effect on
a person who is supposed to obey the orders of the Consumer Fora, so as to give earlier reliefs to the
consumer. Therefore, instead of providing a civil remedy, the Legislature has deleted old section 25
and modified section 25 and so also carried out amendment in section 27 by introduction of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34397750/ 14Rameshbhai Bhagwanjibhai ... vs State Of Gujarat on 20 July, 2023
sub-section (2) & (3) and the Legislature desires that there should be an immediate implementation
of the orders and therefore, while disposing of the complaint filed under section 12, summary
procedure is provided under section 13 & 14 and similarly the speedy and expeditious procedure has
been provided for implementation of execution of interims orders of the Consumer Fora. So also
sub- section (3) of section 25 is introduced for limited purpose of amounts recoverable under the
orders of the Consumer Fora. So also the section 25 has been modified so as to implement any
order, namely, interim NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED:
20/07/2023 undefined order, final order or any other orders. Under section 27, all types of orders,
namely, recovery of the amount, delivery of possession of the property, substitution of the goods,
etc. can be executed by following procedure as laid down under the said section and explained in the
above paras of the judgement. In short, the Legislature intends to give a fastest relief. That has to be
kept in mind as a motto for the earliest disposal of the cases by the Consumer Fora. Only restraint,
the Consumer Fora has to observe that the justice hurried shall not be justice buried, but the
Consumer Fora shall do it by following the procedure as laid down under the law. Therefore,
keeping in mind this aspect, the application under section 27 shall be dealt with by the Consumer
Fora while acting as Judicial Magistrate of the first class. Therefore, the Consumer Fora has to
follow the procedure as stated above. It is required to be mentioned that the remedy under section
27 is not a civil remedy, but is a criminal remedy. It results into a punishment of an imprisonment,
recovery of fine or both. It has deterrent effect, so that the opponent/accused obeys or complies with
the order of the Consumer Fora. This distinct and separate remedy is available to the consumer.
This remedy is quite a distinct and different from the remedy available under section 25(3) for
recovery of the amounts under the orders of the NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020
JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined Consumer Fora. That remedy is a civil remedy under
which the ultimate power of execution of orders of the Consumer Fora is vested with the Collector or
nominees of the Collector on the basis of certificate-the amounts are recovered as arrears of land
revenue. The limitation in respect of that remedy, we have considered in earlier part of this
judgement namely, recovery of the amount, but any other orders passed by the Consumer Fora
cannot be executed under section 25(3). However, under section 27 any order, namely order for
recovery of the amount and for delivery of possession of immovable property, substitution and/or
giving of new goods after accepting old goods, etc. can be executed by punishing persons after trial
as provided in Section 27(3) of Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Therefore, these two remedies which
required a distinct and separate procedure to be followed by the Consumer Fora can not be clubbed
together. However, it will be open for the complainant or the person who is entitled to execute the
orders of the Consumer Fora to follow both the remedies simultaneously by filing a separate
application. A composite application under Section 25(3) and 27 shall not be tenable. If any of the
parties files a composite application, then the Consumer Fora shall give choice to select his remedy
and/or shall give direction to file separate application. It will not be open for the opponent to
contend that NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023
undefined the person entitled to execute the order shall follow the proceeding under section 25 first
in case the order of Consumer Fora is of recovery of the amount. The person entitled to execute the
order may simultaneously file two separate proceedings and the Consumer Fora may proceed to
dispose of these two proceedings by following separate and distinct procedure as pointed out under
this judgement and order." Whereby the observation in para 38 reads as under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34397750/ 15Rameshbhai Bhagwanjibhai ... vs State Of Gujarat on 20 July, 2023
"The Consumer Fora has also to keep in mind that these cases under Section 27 shall
not be treated as regular criminal trails, but they shall try to deal with these cases in
summary manner as provided under the Code of Criminal Procedure Chapter xx and
xxi and therefore, instead of allowing the opponent/accused protracting the criminal
trial either by remaining absent and/or by any other method, the Consumer Fora
while acting as Judicial Magistrate of the first class under Section 27 shall be diligent
and prompt to conclude the summary trial as provided under Chapters XX and XXI.
It is to be noted that in proceedings under Section 27, it is not expected that
opponent/accused shall explain by filing a reply as to why he could not comply with
the order.
NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined This
observation of the Consumer Fora goes against present petitioner.
7.7 Based on the content provided, the learned advocate for the petitioner has cited the judgment of
the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Jolly George Varghese and Others (supra), specifically,
referring to paragraph 16 of the judgment. In this paragraph, it is observed that "Equally meaningful
is the import of Article 21 of the Constitution in the context of imprisonment for non- payment of
debts." The petitioner's advocate contends that this observation implies that a person should not be
imprisoned for their inability to repay debts, in line with the principles enshrined in Article 21 of the
Constitution of India. However, it is noted that the specific provisions of the Consumer Protection
Act need to be considered as a beneficial piece of legislation, aimed at reducing the suffering of
consumers who have been defrauded or cheated, like in the present case. It seems that the
petitioner's advocate is trying to argue that the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act should
take precedence over the general principles of imprisonment for debt and that the Act aims to
protect consumers NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023
undefined from unscrupulous individuals like the present petitioner who have not fulfilled their
financial obligations. 7.8 Now in the case of Om Prakash Bhatia (supra), specifically, paragraphs 6 to
9 are relevant, as under:
"6. Section 27 relates to prosecution of the judgment debtor and it provides penalties
for non-compliance of the order of the Redressal Agencies by him. Under this Section
non-compliance of the order by the Redressal Agencies is punishable with
imprisonment for a term up to 3 years or with a fine upto Rs. 10,000/- or with both.
It also provides minimum punishment. It is mentioned in the Section that the
punishment by way of imprisonment shall not be less than 1 month and by way of
fine shall not be less than Rs. 2,000/-. However, the Agencies have been given power
to impose a sentence of imprisonment or fine or both for a term less than the
minimum term and the amount lesser than the minimum amount, if it is satisfied
that the circumstances of the case so require.
7. The preamble of the Act provides, that the Act has been enacted for better protection of the
interest of the consumers. No particular procedure has been prescribed for the Redressal Agencies
to decide the complaints NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34397750/ 16Rameshbhai Bhagwanjibhai ... vs State Of Gujarat on 20 July, 2023
20/07/2023 undefined filed by the consumers. No guidelines have been provided in the Act, as to
when a decree holder shall proceed under Section 25 and when under Section 27. Section 25 enables
a decree holder to get his decree executed through a civil process. It is well known that the judgment
debtor create legal hurdles in the way of the decree holder at the time of execution and thus deprive
him from the fruit of the decree for a long time.
In many cases, the judgment debtors are in a position to pay the decretal amount, but still they delay
the executions by filing frivolous objections. It is axiomatic that in India the real trouble of a litigant
starts after he obtains a decree. The Legislature while enacting Consumer Protection Act was
mindful of the delays that are caused by the judgment debtors at the time of execution. So it in its
wisdom enacted Section 27, so that a decree holder if he so wishes, can prosecute the judgment
debtor, in case he fails to pay the decretal amount. If the matter is viewed from this angle, it is
evident that Sections 25 and 27 are in the nature of execution proceedings and constitute
independent remedies. The decree holder can avail any of them at his will. It does not mean, that he
cannot avail of the other remedy, if by availing of one remedy, he failed to recover the amount.
NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined
8. In the aforesaid view we are fortified by the observations of the State Commission, Haryana in
Kohinoor Carpets v. Rajinder Arora, II (1991) CPJ 429. The following observations of the learned
Commission may be read with advantage:
"The scheme for enforcement of the orders of the three Redressal Agencies under the Act has then to
be viewed in a larger perspective. This necessarily involves the corelating of Sections 25 and 27 of
the Act. Both these provisions are directed towards the speedy enforcement of the orders of the
District Forum, the State Commission or the National Commission as the case may be. To put it
tersely, both Sections 25 and 27 are in the nature of the execution proceedings of the orders made by
the three Redressal Agencies. While Section 25 visualises the enforcement of such orders by a civil
process, as if they were a decree or order made by a Court of law, Section 27 confers a quasicriminal
sanction for their enforcement by way of punishment with imprisonment or imposition of monetary
penalties."
9. We are, therefore, of the view, that an application under Section 27 is maintainable by the decree
holder against a judgment debtor, inspite of the fact that a NEUTRAL CITATION
R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined remedy by way of execution is
available to him under Section 25 of the Act."
Based on the judgments cited at the bar by the present petitioner, the settled position of law seems
to be against the contention raised by the petitioner that proceedings under Section 27 cannot be
maintained in the context of proceedings under Section 25 of the Consumer Protection Act. It is
important to note that there is no specific order passed by the Consumer Forum in the Tamil
Application, explicitly mentioning the provisions of Sections 25 and 27. However, considering the
nature of the order, it is accepted that the case of the petitioner pertains to the fact that the
proceedings were initially filed under Section 25, and the impugned order was passed under Section
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34397750/ 17Rameshbhai Bhagwanjibhai ... vs State Of Gujarat on 20 July, 2023
27.
7.9 Now, considering further the case of the petitioner herein some other judgments of the Hon'ble
Apex Court in the cases of (i) Meenakshi Saxena and Another versus ECGC Ltd. (Formerly knows as
Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd.) and Another reported in (2018) 7 SCC 479,
specifically paragraphs 15 to 17 are relevant, as under:
NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined "15.
Before we dwell on to the merits of this case, we would like to note certain aspects of execution of a
decree. Section 25 and 27 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, provides for execution of awards. It
would be relevant to note that the 'execution' means:- The word 'execution' in its widest sense
signifies the enforcement of or giving effect to the judgments or orders of the court of justice. In a
narrower sense, it means the enforcement of those judgments or orders by a public officer under the
writs of fieri facias, possession, delivery, sequestration, fieri facias de bonis ecclesiaticis, etc.
16. The amended Section 25 of the Consumer protection Act, which is effective from 15.3.2003 may
be relevant to be noted "25. Enforcement of orders of the District Forum, the State Commission or
the National Commission (1) Where an interim order made under this Act, is not complied with, the
District Forum or the State Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be, may order
the property of the person, not complying with such order NEUTRAL CITATION
R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined to be attached.
(2) No attachment made under subsection (1) shall remain in force for more than three months at
the end of which, if the noncompliance continues, the property attached maybe sold and out of the
proceeds thereof, the District Forum or the State Commission or the National Commission may
award such damages as it thinks fit to the complainant and shall pay the balance, if any, to the party
entitled thereto.
(3) Where any amount is due from any
person under an order made by a
District Forum, State Commission or the
National Commission, as the case may be, the person entitled to the amount may make an
application to the District Forum, the State Commission or the National Commission, as the case
may be, and such district Forum or the State Commission or the National Commission may issue a
certificate for the said amount to the Collector of the district (by whatever name called) and the
Collector shall proceed to recover the amount in the same manner as arrears of land revenue."

17. The whole purpose of Execution proceedings is to enforce the verdict of the court. Executing
court while executing the decree is only concerned with the execution part of it but nothing else. The
court has to take the judgment in its face value. It is settled law that executing court cannot go
beyond the decree. But the difficulty arises when there is ambiguity in the decree with regard to the
material aspects. Then it becomes the bounden duty of the court to interpret the decree in the
process of giving a true effect to the decree. At that juncture the executing court has to be very
cautious in supplementing its interpretation and conscious of the fact that it cannot draw a new
decree. The executing court shall strike a fine balance between the two while exercising this
jurisdiction in the process of giving effect to the decree."
For that purpose, the Hon'ble Apex Court has taken note of this provision in proper context.
(ii) State of Karnataka versus Parmjit Singh and Others reported in (2006) 4 SCC 49, paragraphs 3
to 5 NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined are
relevant, as under:
3. Section 27, prior to its amendment in 2003 read as follows:
"27.Penalties: Where a trader or a person against whom a complaint is made or the
complainant fails to omits to comply with any order made by the District Forum, the
State Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be, such trader or
person or complainant shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term shall not be
less than one month but which may extend to three years, or with fine which shall not
be less than two thousand rupees but which may extend to ten thousand rupees or
with both: Provided that the District Forum, the State Commission or the National
Commission, as the case may be if it is satisfied that the circumstances of any case so
require, impose a sentence of imprisonment or fine, or both, for a term lesser than
the minimum term and the amount lesser than the minimum amount, specified in
this section''.
4. After amendment, Section 27 reads as follows:
1. Penalties: (1) Where a trader or a person against whom a complaint is made (or the complainant)
fails NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined or

imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one month but which may extend to three
years, or with fine which shall not be less than two thousand rupees but which may extend to ten
thousand rupees, or with both: (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974), the District Forum or the State Commission or the National
Commission, as the case may be, shall have the power of a Judicial Magistrate of the first class for
the trial of offences under this Act, and on such conferment of powers, the District Forum or the
State Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be, on whom the powers are so
conferred, shall be deemed to be a Judicial Magistrate of the first class for the purpose of the Code of

(3) All offences under this Act may be tried summarily by the District Forum or the State
Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be."
5. It is to be noted that by the Consumer NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT
DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined Protection (Amendment Act), 2002 (62 of 2002), as contained in
Section 23 of the Amending Act, the proviso which was struck down as un-constitutional by the
High Court has been omitted. Sub-Section (2) has been introduced which provides that the District
Forum or the State Commission or the National Commission, as the case may be, shall have the
power of a Judicial Magistrate of First Class for the trial of offences under the Act and on such
conferment of powers, the District Forum or the State Commission or the National Commission, as
the case may be, on whom the powers are so conferred, shall be deemed to be a Judicial Magistrate
of the First Class of the Code. The amendments have been made effective with effect from
15.03.2003. The controversy has, therefore, become academic. The appeals are, accordingly,
disposed of but without any order as to costs."
(iii) Kamlesh Aggarwal versus Narain Singh Dabbar and Another reported in (2015) 11 SCC 661, this
is very important for considering the legal position of the provisions of Sections 25 and 27 of the
Consumer Protection Act, specifically, paragraphs 4, 14 to 20 are relevant, as under:
"4. Since, there was non compliance of the order NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020
JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined dated 17.10.2003, the appellant filed Execution
Petition before the District Forum to execute the order and requested it to punish the respondents
under Sections 25 and 27 of the Act. In the said case one Gulab Singh (the alleged subsequent
allottee of the plot in question) filed an application in the above proceedings for impleadment before
the District Forum as he was in the possession of the plot in question, which was allotted by the
respondents and a Civil Suit No. 1510 of 2005 filed by him was pending in the Civil Court. The
District Forum vide its order dated 13.9.2006 held that the order dated 17.10.2003 is null and void.
It was further held by the District Forum that the appellant should approach the Civil Court and
only after the rejection of the suit of Gulab Singh in the Civil Court the execution proceedings will be
heard by the District Forum and pass appropriate order and rejected the application of impleadment
of Gulab Singh.
14. The National Commission has rightly declined to exercise the power under Section 21 of the Act
to set aside the order dated 30.7.2013 of the State Commission as no second appeal is provided
against the order of the State Commission in view of sub- Section 2 of Section 27A of the Act, which
states as under :-
NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined "27A.
Appeal against order passed under Section 27.-(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code
of Criminal Procedure 1973 (2 of 1974), an appeal under Section 27, both on facts and on law, shall
lie from -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34397750/ 20Rameshbhai Bhagwanjibhai ... vs State Of Gujarat on 20 July, 2023
(a) the order made by the District Forum to the State Commission;
(b) the order made by the State Commission to the National Commission; and
(c) the order made by the National Commission to the Supreme Court (2) Except as aforesaid, no
appeal shall lie to any court from any order of a District Forum or a State Commission or the
National Commission......" From the reading of the above provisions of the Act, it is clear that
against the order passed by the District Forum under Section 27A of the Act, appeal lies to the State
Commission and against the order of the State Commission, the appeal lies to the National
Commission and against order of the National Commission, the appeal lies to the Supreme Court
and sub- section 2 of the Act states that except as aforesaid, no appeal shall lie to any court from any
order of a District Forum or a State Commission or the National Commission as the case may be.
NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined
15. Therefore, we have to hold that the order passed by the National Commission in holding that
appeals filed by the appellant is not maintainable, is legal and valid and does not call for interference
by this Court. The petition filed under Article 136 of the Constitution of India seeking leave to file
appeal against the order of the National Commission is also not maintainable in law, however we
have to interfere with the order of the State Commission only to the extent in not remanding the
case to the District Forum for passing an order in accordance with law, in not doing so, the right
accrued in favour of the appellant will be lost and therefore, we have to pass appropriate order in
this regard .
16. Having regard to the fact situation that the appellant, who is a consumer, has been litigating the
matter before the District Forum, State Commission and the National Commission for the last 17
years to get her legitimate right of getting the sale deed registered in respect of the allotted site made
by the Navchetna Sahkari Awas Samiti Ltd. in her favour who is its member since 1962, therefore,
we deem it proper to exercise our power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India for the reason
that the State Commission has erred in not remanding the case to the District Forum, after it has
found fault with the NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023
undefined order of the District Forum in convicting and sentencing the officers of Navchetna
Sahkari Awas Samiti Ltd. who are the respondents herein for not following the procedure as
provided under the Criminal Procedure Code and for that reason we deem it just and proper to
remand the case to the District Forum with a direction to the District Forum to follow the procedure
under Section 262 read with Chapter XX, Section 251 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to initiate
penal action against the respondents under Section 27 of the Act for non compliance of the statutory
provisions.
17. It is also needless to mention in this order that no remedy is available to the appellant against the
order of the District Forum even under Section 24 of the Act for the reason that the order passed by
the State Commission, which was not interfered with by the National Commission holding that
second appeal is not maintainable against the order of the State Commission. Further, the order
passed by the State Commission is under Section 27A of the Act in the appeal against the order
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/34397750/ 21Rameshbhai Bhagwanjibhai ... vs State Of Gujarat on 20 July, 2023
dated 30.7.2013 of the District Forum which under Section 27(2) of the Act convicted and sentenced
the respondents in the execution proceedings for non implementation of the order dated 17.10.2003
passed by the District Forum on the NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT
DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined original complaint. Therefore, this Court in exercise of power of
this Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India, the order of the State Commission is
modified to the extent of remanding the case to the District Forum to execute the decree and take
penal action against the respondents by following the procedure under Section 262 read with
Chapter XX and Section 251 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in accordance with law.
18. Further, it is needless to observe in this order that apart from initiating proceedings under
Section 27 of the Act, the alternative right is also available to the appellant to execute the order of
the District Forum by invoking the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 under Order XXI
read with the Rule 32 for seeking direction to the respondents to get sale deed in respect of the Plot
No. 114, Village Khoda, Ghaziabad executed by the Navchetna Sahkari Awas Samiti Ltd. and register
the same before the Sub- Registrar and put her in possession of the same in accordance with the
aforesaid provisions. The execution of the decree in the aforesaid terms is permissible in law in view
of the provisions of Section 13(4), (6) and (7) of the Act, as the provisions of Order XXI read with the
Rule 32 of Code of Civil Procedure are applicable to the District Forum to follow the procedure for
execution of NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023
undefined the order passed by it.
19. In view of the aforesaid provisions of the Act, the provisions of Order XXI read with the Rule 32
of Code of Civil Procedure, are applicable in the execution proceedings before the District Forum for
executing the orders passed on the complaint of the appellant to get the fruits of the same in the
absence of either express or implied exclusion of Code of Civil Procedure to execute the order of the
District Forum. The said provisions of Code of Civil Procedure are applicable to the procedure for
disposal of the complaints by the District Forum not only in relation to the matters enumerated
under Section 13(4),(6) and (7) of the Act but the other provisions of Code of Civil Procedure viz.
Order XXI read with the Rule 32 are applicable for execution of the order of the District Forum and
to give effect to the order passed by it on the complaint as the same will be in the nature of decree as
defined under Code of Civil Procedure as the procedure contemplated under the said order read
with Rule 32 which is a substantial procedural right of the appellant and the same can be invoked by
her as the decree holder.
2. In addition to above, the alternative remedy is also available to the appellant to take penal action
NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined against
the concerned officers of the Navchetna Sahkari Awas Samiti Ltd. under Section 27 of the Act and
therefore, she is at liberty to avail the said remedy also if she wants to get the decree dated
17.10.2003 executed by the District Forum as the same has attained finality in her favour.
With the aforesaid observation and direction to the District Forum and liberty to the appellant, we
allow these appeals to the above said extent. No costs." 7.10 Based on the aforementioned factual
and legal position, it is evident that the complainants in the respective cases have been fighting for
justice since the year 2016 and obtained favorable orders from the Consumer Forum in 2016 itself.

However, the present petitioner has managed to deprive them of the fruits of those orders by
prolonging the litigation through various means. This conduct and practice adopted by the
petitioner are highly disapproved. The petitioner has deliberately not proceeded with the
proceedings initiated by the Consumer Commission following the impugned order. Instead, the
petitioner has filed the present petition, seeking shelter in some general observations made in the
order while ignoring various provisions of NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT
DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined the Consumer Protection Act as well as the settled legal positions.
The conduct of the petitioner deserves strong criticism, and this Court must take serious note of it.
The petitioner has consumed a significant amount of this Court's time, as the present petitions have
been pending since 2016. This delay in the proceedings has further added to the aggrieved
complainants' hardships, who have been awaiting justice for an extended period. In light of these
circumstances, it is essential for the Court to condemn the petitioner's conduct and take necessary
actions to ensure that justice is promptly served to the aggrieved consumers. The petitioner's
attempt to prolong the litigation and evade the consequences of the Consumer Forum's orders
should not be allowed, and the interests of the complainants must be protected by expeditious and
fair resolution of the matter. 7.11 Based on the circumstances and considering the conduct of the
petitioner, the Court deems it appropriate to award costs in each petition. Consequently, the present
petitions are dismissed due to their lack of merit, as they fail to establish a valid cause under Section
226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.
NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023 undefined 7.12 The
petitioner's conduct is highly questionable as they have taken wrongful advantage of the legal
process by repeatedly filing litigations, causing unnecessary delay and consuming precious time of
the Court in deciding such matters. By doing so, the petitioner has been able to prolong the payment
of the amount ordered by the Consumer Court to the respective complainants, who are already in a
helpless situation. 7.13 Given the meritless nature of the petitions and the petitioner's conduct, the
Court dismisses all the petitions with an order to pay a cost of Rs. 5,000/- in each of petition. This
amount must be paid within four weeks from today before the Registry of the Court, and a copy of
the receipt of payment should be submitted to the concerned Consumer Forum. Thereafter, the said
amount shall be paid to the respective complainant/(s) in the respective petitions.
7.14 If the petitioner fails to deposit the cost within the specified four-week period, the Registry will
present the matter before the Court for further action on non-
NEUTRAL CITATION R/SCR.A/1944/2020 JUDGMENT DATED: 20/07/2023
undefined compliance.
8. In view of the aforesaid, the present petitions are dismissed with the aforesaid cost of Rs.5,000/-
in each petitions with the aforesaid condition(s), which shall be paid by the petitioner(s) in
respective petitions.
9. Upon dismissing this petition, it is expected that the District Consumer Forum, Kutch at Bhuj
shall proceed with the pending proceedings before it and take all necessary actions to conclude those
pending cases as expeditiously as possible, preferably within six months from the date of receipt of
