Date 23.6.2022
JUDGMENT
Per Mr. Rajendra Singh, Member: This complaint has been filed by the complainant under section
17 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
The brief facts of the complaint case are that, that the complainant is inter alia seeking damages
from the respondent who has resorted to unfair trade practice and has rendered deficient services as
a result of which the complainant has suffered. The respondent which is a construction company has
delayed in handing over possession of the flat booked by the complainant. The delay has caused
denial of services to the complainant and as such he is liable to pay compensation. The complainant
is a taxpaying surgeon and the respondent is a construction company registered under the
provisions of the Indian Companies Act 1956, having its Letter Office at 10, Local Shopping Centre,
Kalkaji, Delhi.
In or around 2006, the respondent construction company started a Housing Project in Noida, UP,
after obtaining lease from New Okhla Industrial Development Authority, at sector 6 in respect of
1,20,000 m² land on 03.10.2006 for the purpose of developing Group Housing Scheme at GH-01,
02 and 03, sector 93 B, Noida and named it "GRANDSWOOD, Noida". The project was launched
with great fanfare and a big advertisement blitz. As per the brochure, the "GRANDSWOOD, Noida"
was a premium project and the builder had promised world-class facilities. The construction
company, its men and agents had promised that the possession of the flat would be given in 2009.
This promise was also certified by means of email dated 11.03.2008 and 03.11.2008 where they
asserted that possession would be given by June 2009. Another email dated 8.05.2009 was sent
wherein the likely date for delivery opposition was mentioned as March 2010.
Being swayed by the media blitzkrieg launched at the behest of the respondent construction
company, the complainant booked a flat in their housing project on 31.08.2006. The complainant
was shown the model plans of the envisaged housing project and were shown depicting exotic
locales and high-quality construction. He was assured that not only would "GRANDSWOOD, Noida"
have the best class and quality of construction and amenities but also the project would be
completed on time and the first possession would commence in 2009. On being assured about the
timeframe for delivery of the flat, complainant paid the respondent company an advance of
Rs.850,000/- on 31.08.2006 through cheque no.166095 and Rs.5,70,000/- on 26.12.2006 through
cheque no.368134. Thereafter the complainant was informed that flat no. 703 has been booked for
him on seventh floor of Alexandra-A Tower and he further deposited a sum of Rs.433,400/- vide
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121642514/ 2Pradeep Narain vs Omaxe Bild Home Pvt Ltd on 10 May, 2022
cheque no.275519 drawn on Indian Overseas Bank, dated 17.08.2007. The cost of the flat was at the
rate of Rs.3565/- square ft i.e. Rs.5,704,000/- + other charges. The complainant, thereafter
deposited Rs.5,07,800/- on 12.10.2007 through cheque no.276647. As such from 31.08.2006 till
12.10.2007 complainant had paid Rs.2,361,600/-.
Thereafter on further demand of the opposite parties, the complainant paid Rs.745,068/on
19.12.2007 through cheque no.401723 in which a sum of Rs.39,732/- was charged as the interest
and Rs.4,04,647/- dated 25.01.2008 through cheque no.765997 in which a sum of Rs.23,153/- was
illegally charged as the interest. Vide letter dated 04.03.2008 the respondent company sent two
original copies of the allotment letter to the complainant in respect of flat no.703, seventh floor in
Alexandra-A Tower at Omaxe Grandwoods, sector 93B, Noida and required the complainant to sign
each and every page at the place marked allottee and send it back. The complainant objected to the
unfair practice adopted by the respondent company of sending blank document for signature and
requested them to send duly signed copy of the allotment letter and undertook to sign and return
such a copy. The respondent company never sent the duly signed allotment letter however they
continue to demand payment as per the construction linked payment plan. The complainant made
payment as per construction linked payment plan. The opposite parties at the time of booking the
flat assured that the possession of the flat would be handed over to the complainant by June 2009
but the opposite parties instead of maintaining a time discipline regarding pace of construction
demanded money from the complainant from time to time and charged interest at a rate of 18% over
it in the head of delayed payment which comes under the defective as well as unfair trade practice.
The letters and concerns raised by the complainant through his letters dated 22.09.2008 and
04.12.2009 were either totally ignored or brushed aside.
Vide an email dated 03.11.2008 the opposite parties had assured the complainant that the
possession of the flat would be given by June 2009 but thereafter the opposite parties themselves
admitted in their email dated 18.05.2009 that the project was delayed and assured that up to March,
2010 the possession of the flat would be handed over. Needless to say that while there was an
inordinate delay on the part of the respondent company in completing the construction and handing
over possession the religiously charged interest at a rate of 18% on the delayed instalments. The
complainant gave several request letters including letter dated 13.05.2009 for waiver of the interest
charged illegally by the opposite party and also requested for possession of the flat but the opposite
party neither waived off the illegal charges nor took steps to hand over the possession. On
04.12.2009 the complainant once again sent a letter to the opposite party for waiver of the illegal
interest charged by them and further requested for possession of the flat but neither the illegal
interest was waived of nor possession of the flat was offered while a considerable amount has been
already given to the opposite party which shows the ill intention of the opposite party. On
15.03.2010 the respondents sent a letter and demanded service tax from the complainant which was
not at all applicable in the case of the complainant and this letter was suitably replied by the
complainant but the respondent company deliberately ignored the concerns of the complainant and
did not give any reply to the objections of the complainant.
Again on 29.11.2011 the complainant wrote to the respondent company for waiver of the penal
interest charged by the opposite parties and further requested for handing over the possession of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121642514/ 3Pradeep Narain vs Omaxe Bild Home Pvt Ltd on 10 May, 2022
flat after completion of the flat in question. The respondent vide their letter dated 01.02.2012
offered temporary possession and also demanded the balance due amount from the complainant
while the respondents had not completed all works in the flat in question. The action of the
respondent company in offering temporary possession is again an instance of illegality and is again
an unfair trade practice. The complainant refused to be part of this illegal action and asserted that
he would like proper registration of the property with complete and unfettered possession and thus
refused to be part of any illegal exercise offered by the respondent company. On 19.03.2012 the
respondent company by an omnibus decision informed the complainant that the name of the project
had been changed and it was renamed as "Grand Omaxe" for reasons best known to them. The
complainant vide letter dated 28.08.2012 and 24.09.2012 further demanded the possession of the
flat in question. It is important to mention here that from 31 August 2006 to 8 August 2012 the
complainant had paid Rs.7,088,396.15 to the respondent company as per their demand which was
more than the actual cost of the flat. The fact about the payment made is also evidenced by the
account statement given by the respondent company. Despite making all the payments as per the
demand of the respondent company they were unable to start the registration process which they
admitted in their email dated 1 October, 2012 which shows the deficiency on the part of the opposite
party for which they are liable to be paralysed and the complainant be suitably compensated.
Due to repeated reminders from the complainant, the respondent company started the registration
process in 2013. The respondent company on 07.06 2013 sent a letter to the complainant requiring
him to fulfil documentary formalities which included the signing of the allotment letter. The
complainant replied to the letter dated 07.06.2013 sent by the respondent company vide his letter
dated 26.06.2013 and asserted that when the entire payment in respect of the flat had been paid and
receipts accordingly issued it was not at all relevant to sign on the allotment letter now. The
respondent company with a view to harass the complainant insisted that unless the allotment letter
was signed, the registration formalities would not be carried forward. On 26.06.2013 the officials of
the company made a note on the letter dated 07.06.2013 that they had not received the signature of
the complainant along with duly verified by bank and that NOC for maintenance of the flat was
pending and insisted upon clearing the dues for facility plus management. The respondent company
started creating petty fogging objections to thwart the registration process and as such the
complainant was forced to comply with the illegal demands of the respondent company. The
complainant on 28.06.2013 personally submitted a letter to them mentioning his objections while
complying with the illegal demands. Under these compelling circumstances the complainant then
signed the allotment letter on 29.07.2013 and personally handed over the allotment letter. Finally
on 30.07.2013 after an inordinate delay of more than four years the respondent company gave the
possession of the flat in question to the complainant and the registration of the flat in question took
place on 31.07.2013.
It is relevant to mention here that in June 2009 the circle rate of the area for the calculation of
stamp duty is Rs.27,000 per square metre but due to the delay on the part of the respondent the
registration of the flat was done at an enhanced rate of Rs.55,000/- per square metre therefore the
complainant suffered a loss of Rs.174,240/-. The complainant feeling aggrieved by the deficiency in
service and unfair trade practice of the respondent company submitted a legal notice dated
23.09.2013 upon them requiring them to pay Rs.55,340/- the illegal charge against the facility plus
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121642514/ 4Pradeep Narain vs Omaxe Bild Home Pvt Ltd on 10 May, 2022
management, Rs.304,000/ the illegal charge against lease rent, Rs.720,000/- as loss of rent due to
the delay in delivering possession, Rs.174,240/- against loss of stamp duty and Rs.44,17,740/-
interest at a rate of 18% on payment made by the complainant i.e. total sum of Rs.5,671,350/- within
a period of 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice failing which appropriate legal proceedings
would be initiated. The respondent company however failed to comply with the notice and remained
completely inert. The respondent company is liable to be penalysed and the complainant suitably be
compensated for the delay in delivery of possession of the flat and the respondents are also liable to
pay interest at a rate of 18% up on the deposited amount i.e. Rs.7,108,126/-. The complainant is
advised to submit here that the action described in the preceding paragraphs on the part of the
respondent construction company/its authorities/agents/implies is not only unfair but it is also a
serious malpractice and grave deficiency in service.
Likewise exorbitant rates of interest has been charged by the respondent construction company
under various heads. The complainant has been forced to bear the brunt of unreasonable and access
liabilities thrust upon him by the respondent construction company in an illegal and arbitrary
manner. The respondent company enjoyed the interest on the amount deposited by the complainant
and on the other hand deprived the complainant of the property booked by him and also deprive
him of the interest he would have accrued if the same would have been invested in the bank. Had the
flat in question been handed over on time the complainant could have received rental income.
Additionally the complainant had to pay higher stamp duty at the time of registration in 2013 as
compared to the circle rates are prevailing in 2009. In a catena of judgements the court has
observed that where the builder was charging interest for delayed payment it was equitable that the
consumer too be awarded interest for delay in handing over possession. As such the opposite party
is also liable to provide interest at a rate of 18% up on the delayed possession from the date of
deposit to the date of actual possession of the flat in question. It has also been consistent view of the
courts that delay of possession amount to denial of service and therefore the complainant in this
case is also liable to be compensated. It is undisputed that the complainant was ready and willing to
take possession of the flat and had written several letters which were brushed aside by the company
and that it was the intention on the part of the respondent company that losses were suffered by
him. It is pertinent to submit that section 2 (1) (c) of the consumer protection act That 1986 defines
"a complaint" in section 2 (1) (o) defines "Service" in section 2 (1) (R) defines "unfair trade practice"
and which is being reproduced herein under for the convenience of this Hon'ble commission -

).
It is worth a mention that the scheme of law as manifest, from the above provisions of the Consumer
Protection Act 1986 is intended to outlaw practice which are deceptive or otherwise unfair to
consumers. Consumer courts are empowered by the above provisions to protect consumers from
deceptive business practices because as a practical matter, the law as it is raised to fraud and
misrepresentation does not give adequate protection to consumer/investor. The type of projections;
it is submitted, can be attacked by the consumer/investors, is one by which the projections,
representation is designed to make prospective purchasers believe that they would be getting a great
deal. The consumer must get what he's told. Where by any method whatsoever, a belief is created in
the minds of the consumer as to some quality are utility of services (as is the case in the present
case) and they actually fall short of this standard, this will be unfair to the consumer. The
complainant has been unnecessarily dragged into this avoidable and vexatious litigation by the
respondent company/its employees due to various acts of omission and commission committed by
them against the complainants and consequently the complainants have necessarily incurred
litigation costs to which, they are lawfully and otherwise entitled to receive the same from the
respondent bank which has been Monetarily assessed to the tune of (cid:130) 5,644,609/- along with costs,
composition, damages and interest at a rate of 18% per annum till such time as it is actually paid
against the respondent construction company, to meet the and some justice. Hence the Hon'ble
Commission may graciously be pleased to allow the complaint and award a sum of (cid:130) 5,644,609/-
along with interest at a rate of 18% per annum till such time as it is actually paid against the
respondent construction company as damages for the delay in handing over the possession of the
flat no 703 to the complainant and further direct the respondent to pay the aforesaid amount to the
complainant. The opposite party be also directed to refund the excess amount charged by them
under the head of penal interest from the complainant from time to time, the respondent company
be also directed to pay a sum of (cid:130) 1 lakh as compensation and damages in respect of the deficiency in
services as well as unfair trade practice committed by them, the opposite party be also directed to
pay (cid:130) 50,000 as cost of the case and any other order - in which this Hon'ble commission may deem
just and appropriate under the circumstances of the case may also be passed in favour of the
complainants.

The opposite party filed their written statement in which it is submitted that this Hon'ble
Commission has not territorial jurisdiction to entertain the present complaint. The complainant is
not a consumer as per the Consumer Protection Act. The disputes as raised by the complainant are
beyond the scope of consumer disputes but are purely civil dispute, which the complainant has filed
in the form of consumer dispute. There is no cause of action. All the claims between the parties have
already been settled at the time of handing over possession of the captioned property. The
complainant admitted and undertaken vide a written undertaking that "I/We shall have no claim for
any damages/ compensation/penalty for delayed possession from the lessee after the registration of
the sale deed for superstructure of residential unit and sub lease deed for land in my/our favour".
The sale deed for superstructure of residential unit and sub lease deed for land of the captioned unit
was executed and registered on 30.07.2013. In this sale deed also, it is categorically admitted by the
complainant that all disputes between the parties had been amicably settled vide clause 22 of the
sale deed which reads as under:-
"after this deed is executed, no disputes or differences relating to the registration, booking and
allotment and in all such matters as are instrumental to these and are likely to affect the mutual
right, interest, privileges and claim of the 2nd/3rd party would be entertained. In the event of any
dispute, still arising with regard to the terms and conditions of this deed same shall be subject to the
Jurisdiction of District Court, Gautam Budh Nagar and the High Court of judicature at Allahabad".
As such it is admitted case of the complainant that, before taking possession of the captioned unit
and getting execution and registration of the sale deed, all claims were settled between the parties.
Thus the complaint is liable to be dismissed being without any cause of action. The case is barred by
limitation. The prescribed period of limitation for filing of consumer complaint as per the consumer
protection act is two years from the date of cause of action. It is a case of the complainant that the
project was to be completed by the respondent by June 2009. Without prejudice it is submitted that
the cause of action, if any arose, arose in June 2009, whereas the complainant is of 2013 which is
hopelessly barred by limitation. Complainant is not a consumer as per section 2 (d) of the Consumer
Protection Act as the purpose of the complainant was commercial. It is submitted that the
complainant has filed two complaints:-
Complaint Case bearing number C-200/213 titled as Pradeep Narayan Singh versus Omaxe

Buildhome Private Limited in respect of flat no 703, in Alexandra - A Tower in the project Omaxe

Since the complainant admittedly had booked for two flats in the same project and name, has also
filed two Separate Complaints before this Hon'ble Commission for the damages and cost. It is also
not the case of the complainant anywhere in the complaint that he was purchasing the flat/unit shall
in question for his personal use or earn livelihood, which fortify that the complainant is not the
consumer and his purpose for booking and purchasing these two flats was commercial to earn rental

clause 51 of the said Agreement/Allotment letter, it has been agreed between the parties that in the
event of any dispute the same shall be settled through arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration
and Conciliation Act 1996. The arbitration is to be held at Delhi/New Delhi. It is settled law that
where there is an Arbitration Agreement, the parties should get resolved their disputes through

such the complainant is liable to dismissed on this ground alone.
It is denied that the respondent has resorted any unfair trade practice or rendered deficient services

compensation or damages. It is denied that there is any delay on the part of the respondent or the
alleged delay caused denial of service to the complainant or he is liable to be compensated for the
same. As submitted above, all the matters and disputes between the parties have been settled at the
time of handing over possession of the captioned unit to the complainant. It is also submitted that as

is agreed that "the company shall complete the construction of the unit/project within 36 months

months, subject to force majeure conditions". It is pertinent to mention here that, it is admitted case
of the complainant that possession of the captioned unit was handed over to the complainant and
sale deed was also executed and registered on 30.07.2013 that is within the agreed period of 36
months. Thus there is no delay on the part of the respondent.
The respondent is relying only on the original documents. Anything contrary to the documents are
specifically denied. It is submitted that time to deliver the possession was tentative. Further, the
complainant while entering into an agreement on 29.07.2013 agreed that time to complete the
project shall be 36+ further six months commencing from the date of said agreement/allotment
letter. As such, this allotment letter/agreement between the parties supersedes all earlier

interest was illegally charged from the complainant. It is denied that any unfair trade practice was
adopted by the respondent. It is denied that there was any ill intention of the respondent filed

Omaxe and it will start positively by December 2012 (tentatively). It is submitted that the project of
the respondent was complete in time in terms of the agreement between the parties. The delay in
registration process was not on its part but on the part of the concerned authorities and beyond the

raise any question till now on execution of the said allotment letter. The possession and registration
of the captioned unit in question in favour of the complainant of has been done on time. The
complainant did not suffer any loss of (cid:130) 1,74,240/on account of increase in circle rate or is entitled
to recover the same from the respondent. There is no deficiency of services on the part of
respondent and there is no unfair trade practice. It is denied that the complainant is entitled for any
amount much less (cid:130)5,671,350/- or any other amount or any of the heads or interest at a rate of 18%
or on any other rate on the amount of (cid:130) 71,08,126/- or on any other amount as referred in
para-under reply. The respondent has acted as per the agreement between the parties. It had
charged interest on the delayed payment in terms of the agreement between the parties. It is denied
that the respondent has charged exorbitant rate of interest or illegally or arbitrarily or enjoyed the
same or deprived the complainant of the property or interest on the amount. It is also denied that
there was any delay on the part of the respondent or it deprives the complainant from rental income
or compelled to pay higher stamp duty at the time of registration. The complainant is not entitled
for any interest at a rate of 18% or on any other rate upon the alleged delayed possession from the
date of deposit. At this belated stage the complainant is not entitled for any further compensation. It
is denied that the complainant has been unnecessarily dragged into this available or vexatious
litigation by the respondent or the complainant is entitled for the litigation expenses or a sum of (cid:130)
5,644,609/or any other amount or interest as claimed from the respondent. The complainant has
filed a false and vexatious complaint after settling all accounts and without any cause of action. The
complainant is not entitled for any relief as prayed. The complaint is false vexatious and without any
cause of action and hence liable to be dismissed with costs.
We have heard the learned counsel for the complainant Mr. Vikas Agarwal and learned counsel for
the opposite party Mr. Sarvesh Kumar Gupta. We perused the pleadings, evidence and documents
on record.

From the documents on record it is clear that the basic cost of the unit is Rs.5,704,000/- additional
cost Rs.619,090/- maintenance security Rs.80,000/- and government levies Rs.304,000/-. There
are some other costs also mentioned to pay as club cost Rs.75,000/-, electrical equipment cost and
firefighting equipment cost Rs.80,000/-, covered car parking Rs.2 lakhs, power backup equipment
cost Rs.75,000/-, meter cost R.29,090/-, interest free maintenance security Rs.80,000/- and lease
rent (government levies project Rs.304,000/-. The area of the unit is 1600 square ft or 148.64 m².
There is also payment plan of the unit in which payment client has been mentioned according to the
stages of booking and allotment/construction of the unit. According to allotment letter, the
company shall complete the construction of the unit within 36 months from the date of signing of
this allotment letter by the allottee or within an extended period of six months, subject to force
majeure conditions. We have seen the copy of this allotment letter in which no date has been
mentioned on page 2 at the top.
We have seen the payment chart. The first payment was made by cheque no.122385 and 169118
dated 31st August 2006 of Rs.4,50,000/- and Rs.4 lacs respectively. Thus it is clear that the unit
should have been allotted just after depositing of this amount. The next payment is of 26 December
2006 amounting Rs.570,400/- vide cheque no.368133. It shows that by December 2006 the
complainant has deposited Rs.14,20,400/- towards this unit. If allotment letter has not been issued
in September 2006, it is deficiency of service on the part of the opposite party. When the opposite
party has received Rs.850,000/- from the complainant on 31 August 2006 why did allotment letter
not issue by the opposite party ? The opposite party vide his email dated November 3, 2008 at 4.03
PM has assured the complainant that the construction is in full swing and possession shall be given
by June 2009 and other email sent by the opposite party on May 18, 2009 at 7:36 PM, stated that
"we agreed that vide email dated 11.03.2008 our customer relations team informed you about the
tentative date of possession by June 2009 but it does not been that our project is delayed in
construction. Please note that as per the allotment letter executed by us with the individual
customers the first date of possession of the project is March 2010 and we are actually trying to give
it before time." Now there is no doubt regarding the date of delivery of possession as promised by
the opposite party and it is March 2010. We shall presume September 2006 at the date of the
allotment letter. So the said unit was to be constructed within 36 months from September 2006
including a further grace period of six months. After 42 months the opposite party cannot take any
lame excuses for not giving possession of the flat. Thus the date on which the opposite party was
bound to give possession of the unit is March 2010. So it is the date which has also been assured by
the opposite party vide their email.
The first objection of the opposite parties that, that the matter should be referred to the arbitrator.
Whether arbitration is necessary on whether the provisions of Consumer Protection Act are subject
to Arbitration Act.
With the passage of time, the populace of the country is on hike and so are their opinions. Their
opinion forms the basis for their interpretation, it may be a good or a bad interpretation. What
would happen in the situation where people starting interpreting the laws? We might be flooded
with several interpretations. The interpretations will be in such huge number that the laws will
become unclear. This is the reason why lawmakers, while making the law, formulate it the in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121642514/ 11Pradeep Narain vs Omaxe Bild Home Pvt Ltd on 10 May, 2022
accordance with the aim, set out by them, before penning down the legislations. The aim of any
legislation defines the basis of the act. It becomes the ground norm of the act, based upon which the
judiciary interprets the disputed texts.
The aim of any act forms the indispensable element, because it acts as the cord that delivers the real
intention of the legislators behind the act. Whenever there is clash between two legislations, it is the
aim of the legislation which makes the judges to derive at the endpoint in deciding which law has the
superseding effect. It is through the doctrine of pith and substance that judges are able to derive at
the major inclination towards one act over another act. This inclination is decided on the basis of the
aim/goal of the act and the facts of that particular case.
Somewhat similar situation aroused in front of Supreme Court in the case of Aftab Singh and Others
v. Emaar MGF Land Limited and Another ( Review Petition (C) Nos. 2629-2630 of 2018 in Civil
Appeal Nos. 23512-23513 of 2017)[1]. In this case the Supreme Court cleared out the battle between
arbitration and the statutory remedy when it comes upon solving the consumer disputes, which also
upheld the decision of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC). In this
case, the apex body for the consumer dispute in India (NCDRC) ruled in the favor of the statutory
remedy over the arbitration.
The beneficial legislation of Consumer Protection Act aims at reducing the grievances of the all
classes of customers by providing them the preferential treatment. According to the Consumer
Protection Act, the consumer dispute is the entity where the consumer/ customers have been given
the convenient safeguards against ample exploitation like bad customer service, faulty goods or any
unfair trade practices. The interest of the customers is protected by setting up, the three tier
quasi-judicial consumer Redressal machinery which are at national, state and district levels as per
section 9 of Consumer Protection Act. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (CPA) has been enacted
in light of certain concerns related to public policy and the benefit of consumer.
In India, people are least aware with the consumer's rights and lags behind having low general
understanding of arbitration as dispute resolution mechanism. The arbitration clause can curtail the
grounds on which the consumers can raise the disputes, whereas on the other side the consumer
protection act may grant the consumer various grounds on which he can file the complaint which
may not be otherwise permitted in the standard form agreement having the arbitration clause.
Arbitration has equal bargaining powers and the resources at hand which makes it private,
efficacious, and timely form of dispute resolution. Whereas in case of consumer disputes, the case is
different, where they are exposed to the standard form agreements making them submit to the
unfair or the repressive terms. They are several times made part of the one-sided arbitration clause,
which is drafted keeping in mind the interest of one party only.
These days Indians are shifting to the online purchasing platform and being ignorant of not
checking the agreements which makes them to be covered under the blanket provision and end up
being the party to the arbitration. This makes less options opened for the consumer to resort to the
statutory remedies which in turns endangers the interest of the consumers. This may also build the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121642514/ 12Pradeep Narain vs Omaxe Bild Home Pvt Ltd on 10 May, 2022
hostile market against the e-commerce in India. It may have the adverse effect not only on the
Indian economy but also on the e-commerce giants who aims at invest in the growing market.
It was held in the case of Aftab Singh v. Emaar MGF Land Limited & Anr., that the provisions of the
arbitration act does not apply to the consumer courts, as they are the special courts set up for the
public purpose. In this case, the group of the home owners filed the complaint against Emaar MGF
Land Private Limited (Builder) before NCDRC. The complaint was filed for the non-delivering the
plots to the buyers as per the Buyers' Agreement. The builder filed the application under section 8 of
the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, on the basis of the arbitration agreement made between the
parties which was mentioned there in the Buyer's Agreement.
It was argued by the petitioner that the remedies provided under the Consumer Protection Act are
not in exclusion of the existing laws, but are in addition to it, which has been sated in the case
of National Seed Corporation Limited v M. Madhusudhan Reddy( (2012) 2 SCC 506 ) . It was also
argued that the consumer protection act is the piece of the legislation which intends to confer the
benefits and it is the, for which the purpose should be advanced. Therefore, regardless of having
entered into the arbitration clause, the consumer can invoke the section 3 of the Consumer
Protection Act and bring the complaint to the consumer forum( Skypak Couriers Ltd. Vs. Tata
Chemicals Ltd)[3].
The builder pleaded that the Consumer Courts act as the 'judicial authority' within the scope of
section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act and therefore if there is any valid clause entered
between the parties, then the consumer courts can refer the parties to the arbitration. And hence
according to the act the consumer courts are obliged to bring the case for the arbitration,
irrespective of the High Court and Supreme Court decisions. The NCRDC's full bench ruled that the
arbitration act does not bars the consumer court's jurisdiction relying on the Supreme Court's
judgement in the case of Booz Allen Hamilton Inc v. SBI Home Finance Ltd(2011) 5 SCC 532), which
provided the country with the disputes that are not arbitrable. In this case, Supreme Court, came
with the 7 categories of the disputes that are not arbitrable [5].
The commission also relied on the Supreme Court judgement in the case of A. Ayyasamy v. A
Paramasivam(2016)10 SCC 386; N. Radhakrishnan v. Maestro Engineers that the dispute will not be
arbitrable if the civil court's jurisdiction has been exclusively given to a tribunal or the special court.
The Consumer Courts were made to create an organized system for dispute between the people who
possess the unequal power i.e. the consumer and the large corporations. The commission also
pointed out the section 2(3) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act which refers to the situations
where the special categories of disputes are protected from being referred to the arbitration.
Therefore this provision protects the Consumer disputes. The court concluded that if the court
allows party to go for the arbitration and being in favor of the builder, it will defeat the goals and the
main purpose of the Consumer Protection Act.
Section 8 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act states that the judicial authority can instruct the
parties to go for arbitration in the case when there exists the arbitration clause in the arbitration
agreement. It does not bars oust the jurisdiction of the Consumer Court, it will continue to hold and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121642514/ 13Pradeep Narain vs Omaxe Bild Home Pvt Ltd on 10 May, 2022
enjoy the jurisdiction irrespective of presence of an arbitration clause in the agreement.
The Supreme Court contented that there was no legislative intent of the amended provisions of the
section 8(1) in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, so as to override the other statutes which have
the specific remedies. Neither it intends to make disputes related to trusts, criminal law, tenancy,
telecom, family law, IPR, etc, as the arbitrable subject and to against the judgment of A. Ayyasamy v.
A Parasivam & Ors. (2016) 10 SCC 729 ) and Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. v SBI Home Finance Limited
& Ors.(2011) 5 SCC 532).
Supreme Court analyzed the situations prior to 2015 Amendment, related to referring the consumer
disputes to arbitration. Supreme Court referred to the judgments prior 2015 which had the settled
law in cases of Fair Air Engineering Pvt. Ltd . & Anr. V N K Modi (1996) 6 the SCC 385, National
Seeds Corporation Limited v. Madhusudhan Reddy & Anr. (2012) 2 SCC 506 and Rosedale
Developers Private Limited V. Aghor Bhattacharya & Ors. (2018) 11 SCC 337. These cases held that
even if the dispute arise from the contract having the arbitration clause, it will not impede the
parties to resort to file a complaint before the consumer forum under Consumer Protection Act. All
of the judgements had the rationale that provision of section 3 of Consumer Protection Act states
that "the provision is in addition to, and not in the derogation of any other law for the time being in
force."
The Supreme Court acknowledged the 2015 amendment which restricted the power of any judicial
authority to refuse to refer the dispute to arbitration under section 8(1) and appointment of
arbitrator under section 11(6A) and also acknowledged the fact that it invalidated the earlier
precedent in the case of Sukanya Holding (P) Ltd. v. Jayesh H Pandya & Anr.(2003) 5 SCC 531
Supreme Court considering section 2(3) of the arbitration act, states that the Part I of the arbitration
act shall not affect any other law for the time being in force, by virtue of which certain disputes may
not be submitted to the arbitration. Supreme Court stated that the legislative intent of 2015
Amendment was never to override section 2(3) of the Arbitration Act and other statute which offers
the public remedy like that of CPA. The Supreme Court in 1994 already held that CPA is a beneficial
legislation which provides the economical and expeditious remedies to the aggrieved consumer in
the case of Lucknow Development Act V M K Gupta(1994) 1 SCC 243).
Referring to all of the above cases, the Supreme Court in this case affirmed that the decision given
by NCDRC is valid and stated that the consumer dispute are the subject matter where the dispute
cannot be referred to arbitration as it pertains to rights in rem (public rights). It comes under the
ambit of the non-arbitrable dispute defined under Booz Allen and Ayyasamy case. The disputes are
non-arbitrable in disputes related to criminal laws, tenancy, trusts, family law, telecom, IPR,
insolvency and winding up, and in certain cases, fraud.
It can be ensured with the judgement that consumers who have lesser bargaining power than that of
the service providers shall not be pushed towards the relatively cumbersome process of the
arbitration where there can be other more affordable and efficacious low public law remedies
available. The CPA is a special legislation which has the public law remedies dealing with the rights
under the umbrella of "right in rem" which has been espoused by Booz Allen. The case had many
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121642514/ 14Pradeep Narain vs Omaxe Bild Home Pvt Ltd on 10 May, 2022
critics for it, as it was delivered during the course of time, when India has been continuously
focusing upon the survival and the supremacy of the arbitration proceeding over litigation in the
Indian dispute resolution. And it was the major reason that it appeared for some of the people as a
diversion from the object of Indian arbitration system to be an arbitration-friendly hub. This also
draws our attention towards the fact that the arbitration shall be made a more consumer-friendly
method of dispute resolution. It is because of this judgement that people were able to depict the
heightened element of the public interest consumer dispute in India.
Thus it has become clear that the special act of Consumer Protection Act is not in derogation of any
act but it is in addition of another act. So this court has jurisdiction to decide the consumer cases
even if there is any clause of the matter to the arbitrator.
In a case where no time limit has been mentioned for the delivery opposition, Hon'ble Supreme
Court has said that it should not be limitless and there shall be deemed reasonable period of three
years for the delivery of possession.
However the Hon'ble Supreme Court in CIVIL APPEAL NO(S). 3533-3534 OF 2017 M/S. FORTUNE
INFRASTRUCTURE (NOW KNOWN AS M/S. HICON INFRASTRUCTURE) & ANR. VS TREVOR
D'LIMA & ORS. (Judgement March 12, 2018) has held:
"15. Moreover, a person cannot be made to wait indefinitely for the possession of the flats allotted to
them and they are entitled to seek the refund of the amount paid by them, along with compensation.
Although we are aware of the fact that when there was no delivery period stipulated in the
agreement, a reasonable time has to be taken into consideration. In the facts and circumstances of
this case, a time period of 3 years would have been reasonable for completion of the contract i.e., the
possession was required to be given by last quarter of 2014. Further there is no dispute as to the fact
that until now there is no redevelopment of the property. Hence, in view of the above discussion,
which draw us to an irresistible conclusion that there is deficiency of service on the part of the
appellants and accordingly the issue is answered. When once this Court comes to the conclusion
that, there is deficiency of services, then the question is what compensation the
respondents/complainants is entitled to ?"
In the above-mentioned case Hon'ble Supreme Court also held regarding payment of compensation
or quantum of compensation as follows:
"18. This Court in Ghaziabad Development Authority v. Balbir Singh, (2004) 5 SCC 65, has observed
that there is no fixed formula for fixing damages in the following manner
8. However, the power and duty to award compensation does not mean that irrespective of facts of
the case compensation can be awarded in all matters at a uniform rate of 18% per annum. As seen
above, what is being awarded is compensation i.e. a recompense for the loss or injury. It therefore
necessarily has to be based on finding of loss or injury and has to correlate with the amount of loss
or injury. Thus, the Forum or the Commission must determine that there has been deficiency in
service and/or misfeasance in public office which has resulted in loss or injury. No hard-and-fast
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121642514/ 15Pradeep Narain vs Omaxe Bild Home Pvt Ltd on 10 May, 2022
rule can be laid down, however, a few examples would be where an allotment is made, price is
received/paid but possession is not given within the period set out in the brochure. The
Commission/Forum would then need to determine the loss. Loss could be determined on basis of
loss of rent which could have been earned if possession was given and the premises let out or if the
consumer has had to stay in rented premises then on basis of rent actually paid by him.Along with
recompensing the loss the Commission/Forum may also compensate for harassment/injury, both
mental and physical. Similarly, compensation can be given if after allotment is made there has been
cancellation of scheme without any justifiable cause. That compensation cannot be uniform and can
best be illustrated by considering cases where possession is being directed to be delivered and cases
where only monies are directed to be returned. In cases where possession is being directed to be
delivered the compensation for harassment will necessarily have to be less because in a way that
party is being compensated by increase in the value of the property he is getting. But in cases where
monies are being simply returned then the party is suffering a loss inasmuch as he had deposited the
money in the hope of getting a flat/plot. He is being deprived of that flat/plot. He has been deprived
of the benefit of escalation of the price of that flat/plot. Therefore, the compensation in such cases
would necessarily have to be higher. ... We clarify that the above are mere examples. They are not
exhaustive. The above shows that compensation cannot be the same in all cases irrespective of the
type of loss or injury suffered by the consumer." (emphasis supplied) Before discussing further, we
have to see the basic object of the Consumer Protection Act.
The Consumer Protection Act, came into existence and implemented in 1986, provides Consumer
Rights to prevent consumers from fraud or specified unfair practices. It safeguards and encourages
and gives an opportunity to consumers to speak against insufficiency and flaws in goods and
services. If traders, manufacturers and distributors follow any foul trade, this act protects their
rights as a consumer.
This Protection Act covers entire goods and services of all sectors that are public, private, or
cooperative sectors, except those exempted by the central government. The act provides a floor for a
consumer where one can file their complaint against the product and the forum takes an action
against the concerned supplier and compensation is granted to the consumer for the inconvenience
he/she has encountered. The objectives of the consumer petition act may be summarised as -
To Provide better and all round protection to consumer.
To Provide machinery for the speedy redressal of the grievances.
To Create framework for consumers to seek redressal.
To Provide rights to consumers.
To Safeguarde rights of Consumers.
What are the rights of consumers? Let us know more about the rights of consumer. Listed below are
the Rights of the Consumer:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121642514/ 16Pradeep Narain vs Omaxe Bild Home Pvt Ltd on 10 May, 2022
Right to Safety- Before buying, a consumer can examine on the quality and guarantee of the goods
and opt for ISI or AGMARK products.
Right to Choose- Consumer must have the right to choose from a variety and number of goods and
in a competitive price Right to be informed- The buyers must be provided with complete
information with all the necessary and adequate details of the product, make her/him act wise, and
change the buying decision.
Right to Consumer Education- The consumer must be aware of his/her rights and avoid
exploitation.
Right to be heard- The consumer will get due attention to express their grievances at a suitable
platform.
Right to seek compensation- The consumer has the right to seek or ask for redressal against unfair
and inhumane practices or exploitation of the consumer.
So it is clear that the Consumer Protection Act has been passed to safeguard the interest of the
consumers. Now we come to the facts of the present case. If the consumer is depositing lakhs of
rupees in hope of getting possession of the flat/plot, he cannot be deprived of his right to get a flat or
plot within a reasonable time. If the builder takes money from the allottees beforehand and executes
allotment letter after many years and a condition has been inserted in the allotment letter that the
project will be completed within three years from the date of the allotment order is totally unfair
trade practice and it cannot get support from the court of law because here rule of law prevails. If a
person has deposited (cid:130) 850,000 in September 2006, the period of construction shall be reckoned
from that month and not from the date when the allotment order was delivered because because due
to highhandedness of the builders the main issue allotment letter after years and years of the
deposition of the money by the allottees. So in this case and in the light of judgement of the Supreme
Court the reasonable time for handing over the possession of the flat or unit is three years. In this
case the builder has taken six months grace period that is the allottees are assured that they will get
possession of the flat/unit/plot within 42 months. So if this 42 months are added to September
2006 the cut of date for delivery of possession comes March 2010. So the opposite party was bound
to deliver the possession of the flat/unit to the complainant by March 2010. The delivery of
possession and execution of sale deed and restriction of the flat in question place on 31 July 2013. So
in this case possession has been given after 40 months from the assured giving possession.
No interest has been paid on the deposited amount to the complainant. So as far as cost of action is
concerned, it is continuing cause of action after 42 months from the date of tentative date for
delivery of possession that is March 2010 and possession has been handed over on 31 July 2013 so
the cause of action also arose from 31 July 2013 because the conditions by the buyer were not
fulfilled.
There is not a single word regarding completion certificate, occupancy certificate, NOC from
pollution department, NOC from civil aviation Department and NOC from fire department. Without
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121642514/ 17Pradeep Narain vs Omaxe Bild Home Pvt Ltd on 10 May, 2022
these, offer of giving possession is no offer in the eye of law.
In the case of Faqir Chand Gulati Vs. Uppal Agencies Pvt. Ltd. & Anr., Civil appeal no.3302 of
2005, judgment dated 10.06.2008, Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that a prayer for completion
certificate and C&D Forms cannot be brushed aside by stating that the builder has already applied
for the completion certificate or C&D Forms. If it is not issued, the builder owes a duty to make
necessary application and obtain it. If it is wrongly withheld, he may have to approach the
appropriate court or other forum to secure it. If it is justifiably withheld or refused, necessarily the
builder will have to do whatever is required to be done to bring the building in consonance with the
sanctioned plan so that the municipal authorities can inspect and issue the completion certificate
and also assess the property to tax. If the builder fails to do so, he will be liable to compensate the
complainant for all loss/damage.
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ireo Grace Realtech Private Limited Vs. Abhishek Khanna &
Ors., civil appeal no.5785 of 2019, with other civil appeals, judgment 11.01.2021, has held where the
development makes an alternate offer of allotment of apartment, the allottees are however not
bound to accept the same because of inordinate delay in completing the construction of the towers
or units were allotted to them and if the Occupation Certificate is not available even as on date,
clearly amounts to deficiency of service.
Now it is clear that the reasonable period for handing over the possession of the flat/plot is three
years from the date of allotment order and also if the occupancy certificate has not been obtained,
offering delivery of possession is deficiency of service. Also the completion certificate is of utmost
importance. In the present case the above mentioned certificates have not been produced before this
court. In addition to it there is no NOC of fire department, civil aviation Department and pollution
department. Therefore it will be said that the said flat is not ready for the delivery of possession in
the absence of these certificates.
In the present case, and eye-opening fact has also been raised by the complainant that the circle rate
of the area for calculation of stamp duty was about Rs.27,000/- per square metre in June 2009 and
this date was for the first date which was promised by the opposite party for delivery of possession
vide their email as mentioned above. Due to delay in handing over possession by the opposite party,
the circle rate for the calculation of the stamp duty has been enhanced from Rs.27,000/- per square
metre to Rs.55000/- m². So this is due to fault, deficiency in service of the opposite party and the
complainant has to bear this enhanced circle rate without any fault of their own. Who will pay
damages for this fault? Clearly it is the builder/party who will compensate this enhanced amount to
the allottee. So the difference in the circle rate comes Rs.28,000/- per square metre. The area of the
unit is 148.64 m² say 149 m². The the difference in circle rate unnecessarily by the complainant is
149 x Rs.28,000/-.
Now the next question comes as to whether the opposite party was entitled to claim interest on the
delayed payment? The opposite party also contributed towards delay. So he cannot claim interest
when he is on fault of his own. The complainant has stated that he has paid Rs.7,088,396.15/to the
opposite party which is more than the actual cost of the flat. We have seen the payment plan of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121642514/ 18Pradeep Narain vs Omaxe Bild Home Pvt Ltd on 10 May, 2022
unit filed by the opposite party in which total cost has been mentioned as Rs.6,707,090/- inclusive
of all the charges. There is no mention of interest paid to the complainant due to delay in project. It
shows that the builder is on a dominating position over the complainant. He can take exorbitant rate
of interest on delayed payment but he will not give any interest or any damages on the delayed
delivery of possession.
Now some case laws of Hon'ble Supreme Court and Hon'ble NCDRC are to be discussed in this light.
In R. V. Prasannakumaar v. Mantri Castles Pvt. Ltd., 2019 SCC on Line SC 224, under the terms of
the ABA, possession of the flats was to be handed over to the buyers on 31 January 2014. However,
the developer received an occupation certificate only on 10 February 2016 and it was thereafter from
May 2016 that the developer started issuing letters offering possession. Based on this, the NCDRC
awarded compensation in the form of interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum. The developer
had pleaded that since the agreement provided compensation at the rate of Rs.3 per square foot per
month for delayed possession, the purchasers were not entitled to anything in addition. Dealing
with the submission, this Court observed:
"9. We are in agreement with the view of the NCDRC that the rate which has been stipulated by the
developer, of compensation at the rate of Rs.3 per sq. ft. per month does not provide just or
reasonable recompense to a flat buyer who has invested money and has not been handed over
possession as on the stipulated date of 31 January 2014. To take a simple illustration, a flat buyer
with an agreement of a flat measuring a 1000 sq. ft. would receive, under the agreement, not more
than Rs. 3000/- per month. This in a city such as Bangalore does not provide just or adequate
compensation. The jurisdiction of the NCDRC to award just compensation under the provisions of
the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 cannot in the circumstances be constrained by the terms of the
agreement. The agreement in its view is one sided and does not provide sufficient recompense to the
flat purchasers."
The Court observed that there was a delay of two years and hence the award of interest at the rate of
6 per cent was reasonable and justified.
In Pioneer Urban Land and Infrastructure Limited v. Govindan Raghavan, (2019) 5 SCC 725, there
was a delay of almost two years in obtaining an occupancy certificate after the date stipulated in the
ABA. As a consequence, there was a failure to provide possession of the flat to the purchaser within a
reasonable period. This Court dwelt on the terms of the ABA under which the builder was entitled to
charge interest at 18 per cent per annum for the delay in payment of instalments by the purchaser.
On the other hand, the failure to provide possession on the part of the developer was subject to a
grace period of twelve months followed by a termination notice of ninety days and a further period
of ninety days to the developer to effect a refund. Adverting to these clauses, the court noted:
"6.4. A perusal of the apartment buyer's agreement dated 8-5- 2012 reveals stark incongruities
between the remedies available to both the parties. For instance, Clause 6.4(ii) of the agreement
entitles the appellant builder to charge interest @18% p.a. on account of any delay in payment of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121642514/ 19Pradeep Narain vs Omaxe Bild Home Pvt Ltd on 10 May, 2022
instalments from the respondent flat purchaser. Clause 6.4(iii) of the agreement entitles the
appellant builder to cancel the allotment and terminate the agreement, if any instalment remains in
arrears for more than 30 days. On the other hand, as per Clause 11.5 of the agreement, if the
appellant builder fails to deliver possession of the apartment within the stipulated period, the
respondent flat purchaser has to wait for a period of 12 months after the end of the grace period,
before serving a termination notice of 90 days on the appellant builder, and even thereafter, the
appellant builder gets 90 days to refund only the actual instalment paid by the respondent flat
purchaser, after adjusting the taxes paid, interest and penalty on delayed payments. In case of any
delay thereafter, the appellant builder is liable to pay interest @9% p.a. only. Another instance is
Clause 23.4 of the agreement which entitles the appellant builder to serve a termination notice upon
the respondent flat purchaser for breach of any contractual obligation. If the respondent flat
purchaser fails to rectify the default within 30 days of the termination notice, then the agreement
automatically stands cancelled, and the appellant builder has the right to forfeit the entire amount of
earnest money towards liquidated damages. On the other hand, as per Clause 11.5(v) of the
agreement, if the respondent flat purchaser fails to exercise his right of termination within the time
limit provided in Clause 11.5, then he shall not be entitled to terminate the agreement thereafter,
and shall be bound by the provisions of the agreement."
Hon'ble Justice Indu Malhotra speaking for the Court noted:
"6.8. A term of a contract will not be final and binding if it is shown that the flat purchasers had no
option but to sign on the dotted line, on a contract framed by the builder. The contractual terms of
the agreement dated 8-5-2012 are ex facie one-sided, unfair and unreasonable. The incorporation of
such one-sided clauses in an agreement constitutes an unfair trade practice as per Section 2(1)(r) of
the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 since it adopts unfair methods or practices for the purpose of
selling the flats by the builder." The Court observed that in these circumstances, the flat purchasers
could not be compelled to obtain possession which was offered almost two years after the grace
period under the agreement had expired. Hence, the NCDRC was held to have correctly awarded
interest at the rate of 10 percent per annum.
The decision of this Court in Dhanda Case, 2019 SCC On Line SC 689 has been relied upon by
learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the developer as elucidating the principle that where
a flat buyers agreement stipulates a consequence for delayed possession, exceptional and strong
reasons must be established before the forum constituted under the Act of 1986 awards
compensation in addition to what has been contractually agreed. In Dhanda's case, the SCDRC
issued a direction for handing over physical possession of the residential unit to the complainant
and for execution of a sale deed. In addition, compensation was awarded by way of interest at the
rate of 12 per cent per annum with effect from twelve months after the stipulated date under the
agreement. In an appeal by the developer, the NCDRC directed that the rate of interest for a house
building loan for the corresponding period in a scheduled nationalised bank would be appropriate
and if a floating rate of interest was prescribed, the higher rate of interest should be taken for the
computation. A sum of Rs.1 lac per annum from the date for handing over possession to the actual
date of possession was regarded as appropriate in the facts of the case. In that case under the terms
of the buyer's agreements, possession was to be delivered within twenty-four months of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121642514/ 20Pradeep Narain vs Omaxe Bild Home Pvt Ltd on 10 May, 2022
execution of the agreement i.e. 10 February 2013 - failing which the developer was liable to pay
compensation at the rate of Rs.10 per square foot per month for the delay. The developer contended
that construction activities were delayed as a result of an injunction granted by this Court over a
period of eight months and consequently sought an extension of the period for handing over
possession by one year. Alternatively, the developer offered to refund the money deposited with
interest at 9 per cent per annum. Construction of 258 independent floors was completed while about
1,500 units were nearing completion. In two sets of Civil Appeals which came up before this Court
earlier, agreed terms were arrived at providing for the award of interest at 9 per cent per annum
from the date of deposit till refund. While considering the order of the NCDRC, this Court observed:
"16. The District Forum under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is empowered inter-alia to order
the opposite party to pay such amount as may be awarded as compensation to the consumer for any
loss or injury suffered by the consumer due to the negligence of the opposite party including to grant
punitive damages. But the forums under the Act cannot award interest and/or compensation by
applying rule of thumb. The order to grant interest at the maximum of rate of interest charged by
nationalised bank for advancing home loan is arbitrary and no nexus with the default committed.
The appellant has agreed to deliver constructed flats. For delay in handing over possession, the
consumer is entitled to the consequences agreed at the time of executing buyer's agreement. There
cannot be multiple heads to grant of damages and interest when the parties have agreed for
payment of damages at the rate of Rs. 10/- per sq. ft. per month. Once the parties agreed for a
particular consequence of delay in handing over of possession then, there has to be exceptional and
strong reasons for the SCDRC/NCDRC to award compensation at more than the agreed rate."
Now the interest may be 6% to 10% in favour of the allottees if they have not been given possession
of the flat/plot within promised or within a reasonable time. The complainant has deposited the
entire agreed cost of the flat before June 2009. Now it is the duty and obligation of the opposite
party to deliver the possession within stipulated time but they failed to do so.
In the case of PRIYANKA MITTAL & ANR. V. PARSVNATH DEVELOPERS LTD. & ANR.

The Hon'ble NCDRC held that:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121642514/ 21Pradeep Narain vs Omaxe Bild Home Pvt Ltd on 10 May, 2022
"Brief facts of the cases are that opposite parties/respondents are engaged in the activity of housing
construction and accordingly they have launched a project named as Parsvnath Planet situated in
Gomti Nagar, Lucknow. The project was demonstrated to be very lucrative and made attractive to
the vendees, in order to procure/collect money from the needy persons demonstrating themselves to
be excellence in the field of construction activity as compared to other builders and assured the
buyers/complainants that it has been duly approved by the Lucknow Development Authority and
necessary permission has also been obtained from them. The emphasis was made by the opposite
parties that the possession of the Unit shall be given within a scheduled period of 36+6=42 months
stipulated in agreements executed in between the parties for the project launched in the year 2006.
The complainants/appellants attracted by the promise and assurance of the opposite parties,
somehow managed and arranged the money from their personal sources as well as on loan at
attractive rate of interest and the hard earned money was paid by them to the opposite parties in a
hope that the possession of the units shall be provided to them in the year 2009 and they can leave
peacefully in their own houses, since the complainants are living in rented houses.
The complainants visited the construction site of the opposite parties after depositing the entire
amount, where it was revealed that the construction activities were on halt and the persons available
on the site told the complainants that the apartments are likely to be completed till 2015. Even the
partial construction done by the opposite parties was defective and did not match the specifications
provided in the agreement. The complainants were shocked on hearing it and observing the site. The
complainants immediately contacted the Area Manager, who told the complainants that there is
some delay in the construction of the apartment and the apartments shall be ready till June, 2010.
The complainants have to repay the amount taken on loan alongwith interest without getting the
possession of the allotted units causing irreparable loss and injury to them. The complainants have
come to know that the opposite parties have invested the funds earmarked for this project into their
other projects in other city due to which they have not been able to complete the project in time.
Besides this, it has also come to the light that although the opposite parties had collected huge funds
from the buyers but in spite of that the opposite parties have miserably failed to pay the dues of
Lucknow Development Authority which forced the Lucknow Development Authority to issue
coercive measures against the opposite parties for the recovery of their dues. Alleging deficiency on
the part of opposite parties/ respondents, complainants filed separate complaints before State
Commission. Aggrieved by the order of Hon'ble State Commission, these appeals preferred
before Hon'ble National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.
Hon'ble NCDRC discussed various case laws and after hearing the parties held, "Learned
Counsel for appellants submitted that as complainants have been deprived of possession for a long
period beyond agreed period, it amounts to restrictive trade practice under Section 2 (nnn) of
Consumer Protection Act and complainants are entitled to get compensation. Section 2 (nnn) runs
as under:- means a trade practice which tends to bring about restrictive trade practice manipulation
of price or its conditions of delivery or to affect flow of supplies in the market relating to goods or
services in such a manner as to impose on the consumers unjustified costs or restrictions and shall
include- Delay beyond the period agreed to by a trader in supply of such goods or in providing the
services which has led or is likely to lead to rise in the price; Any trade practice which requires a
consumer to buy, hire or avail of any goods, or, as the case may be, services as condition precedent
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/121642514/ 22Pradeep Narain vs Omaxe Bild Home Pvt Ltd on 10 May, 2022
to buying, hiring or availing of other goods or services; Perusal of aforesaid provision reveals that
when opposite party delays in delivery of goods which leads to rise in the price of goods meaning
thereby, more price is charged from complainant, it amounts to restrictive trade practice. In the case
in hand, opposite party on account of delayed delivery of possession is not charging higher rate than
the agreed rate for delivery of possession of flat, so, it does not fall within the purview of restrictive
trade practice under Section 2(nnn) of Consumer Protection Act.
"Admittedly, agreements were executed in 2006 and as per agreements, possession of flats was to be
delivered within 42 months, meaning thereby, possession was to be given in the year 2009-2010
and possession has not been handed over so far though year 2016 has started. No doubt,
complainants are entitled to get penalty amount for delayed delivery of possession as per clause 10 (
c) of the agreement but opposite party cannot be permitted to avail benefit of aforesaid clause for
indefinite period. This penalty clause should be allowed for the benefit of parties for a limited period
and in the cases in hand, I deem it appropriate to extend applicability of aforesaid clause for a
period of one year beyond 42 months and after that, complainants are certainly entitled to
compensation. Opposite party cannot be allowed to avail huge funds of complainants by paying
merely Rs. 5/- per sq. ft. for example, complainants who have purchased flat measuring 164.901 sq.
mtr., they have made payment of about Rs. 31.00 to 32 lakhs and in the garb of clause 10 (c),
opposite party is paying penalty @ approximately Rs. 9,000/- per month against enjoying funds
more than Rs. 30.00 lakhs. As complainants have been deprived to shift to their flats for a long
period which would not only have given them satisfaction of living in their own house but also have
raised their social status and opposite party has enjoyed funds of complainants for a long period, I
deem it appropriate to allow compensation @ Rs. 15,000/- p.m. to the complainants who have
applied for flats upto 175 sq. mtr and Rs. 20,000/- per month to complainants who have applied for
flats above 175 sq. after 54 months of execution of agreement till delivery of possession".
Against this judgment, parties went to Hon'ble Supreme Court. The judgment of Hon'ble Supreme
Court is:-
In Nalin Bhargava vs. Parsvnath Developers Ltd. CA 6662/2018 @ SLP(C) 7596/2016 etc and
other related civil appeals on 13 July, 2018, Hon'ble Supreme Court held:-
"Leave granted in all the special leave petitions.CA 6662/2018 @ SLP(C) 7596/2016 etc.
It is submitted by Mr. M.L. Lahoty, learned counsel appearing for the appellants in all the
appeals that the possession has been handed over and the deficiencies have been removed and,
therefore, he has no grievance. However, Mr. Lahoty would insist that there should be imposition
of costs as compensation.
Mr. Sachin Datta, learned senior counsel appearing for the developer has raised objections with regard to imposition of costs.
Having heard learned counsel for the parties, we are of the considered opinion that the cause of justice would be best subserved if each of the appellants in the present appeals are given Rs.1,50,000/- (Rupees one lakh fifty thousand only) per flat, towards costs. When we say "cost", we mean costs alone and nothing else."

In the case of Kolkata West International City Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Devasis Rudra [Civil Appeal No. 3182 of 2019 @ SLP (C) No(S). 1795 of 2017] judgment delivered on 25.03.2019, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held:-
"Interestingly, where the buyer is in default, the agreement stipulates that interest at the rate
of 18 per cent from the date of default until the date of payment would be charged for a period of two
months, failing which the allotment would be cancelled by deducting 5% of the entire value of the
property. The agreement was evidently one sided. For a default on the part of the buyer, interest at
the rate of 18% was liable to be charged. However, a default on the part of the developer in handing
over possession would make him liable to pay interest only at the savings bank rate prescribed by
the SBI. There is merit in the submission which has been urged by the buyer that the agreement was
one sided.
In the Case of Wg. Cdr. Arifur Rahman Khan and Aleya Sultana and Ors. Versus DLF
Southern Homes Pvt. Ltd (now Known as BEGUR OMR Homes Pvt. Ltd.) and Ors. (Civil Appeal
No. 6239 of 2019 With Civil Appeal No. 6303 of 2019); The Hon'ble Supreme Court has held:-
"24. A failure of the developer to comply with the contractual obligation to provide the flat to
a flat purchaser within a contractually stipulated period amounts to a deficiency. There is a fault,
shortcoming or inadequacy in the nature and manner of performance which has been undertaken to
be performed in pursuance of the contract in relation to the service. The expression "service" in
Section 2 (1) (o) means a service of any description which is made available to potential users
including the provision of facilities in connection with (among other things) housing construction.
Under Section 14(1)(e), the jurisdiction of the consumer forum extends to directing the opposite
party inter alia to remove the deficiency in the service in question. Intrinsic to the jurisdiction which
has been conferred to direct the removal of a deficiency in service is the provision of compensation
as a measure of restitution to a flat buyer for the delay which has been occasioned by the developer
beyond the period within which possession was to be handed over to the purchaser. Flat purchasers
suffer agony and harassment, as a result of the default of the developer. Flat purchasers make
legitimate assessments in regard to the future course of their lives based on the flat which has been
purchased being available for use and occupation. These legitimate expectations are belied when the
developer as in the present case is guilty of a delay of years in the fulfillment of a contractual
obligation. To uphold the contention of the developer that the flat buyer is constrained by the terms
of the agreed rate irrespective of the nature or extent of delay would result in a miscarriage of
justice."
"Undoubtedly, as this court held in Dhanda, courts ordinarily would hold parties down to a
contractual bargain. Equally the court cannot be oblivious to the one-sided nature of ABAs which
are drafted by and to protect the interest of the developer. Parliament consciously designed
remedies in the CP Act 1986 to protect consumers. Where, as in the present case, there has been a
gross delay in the handing over of possession beyond the contractually stipulated debt, we are
clearly of the view that the jurisdiction of the consumer forum to award just and reasonable
compensation as an incident of its power to direct the removal of a deficiency in service is not
constrained by the terms of a rate which is prescribed in an unfair bargain."

These builders are just earning money from the consumers to whom they issued allotment
letters and got a huge amount. They keep this amount for a long time and earn interest on it.
Property dealing is that part of business where they never pay a penny to the consumers on their
amounts deposited for a long-term or if they pay, they pay a meagre interest of about 5% or so but
they charge 18 to 24% or more if the consumers default in depositing any instalment. It reminds us
the story of "The Merchant of Venice" The Merchant of Venice is the story of a Jewish money lender
Shylock who demands that an antisemitic Christian offer "a pound of flesh" as collateral against a
loan. These acts of builders also remind us the age of Sahukari during ancient India and also during
British Raj. Whether these builders have power to frame their own law? They put their terms and
conditions in such a way that the sufferer will always be the consumer. The Consumer Protection Act
1986 has been enacted for the benefits of consumers, so the courts dealing with Consumer
Protection Act 1986 should come forward for their rescue. The courts are not governed by the
builders but they are governed by the law, Custom and Usages. Now in the background of all the
facts and also the facts of the present case, we will also discuss something more.
Now it has been very well established that the opposite party completely failed to deliver the
possession of the said flat on June 2009 as per their own promise. Later on vide an email the
complainant was assured that he will get the possession by March 2010. But the possession has also
not been delivered in June 2009 or in March 2010. It is deficiency of services on the part of opposite
party and demanding more and more money and extending time regarding completion of the
project is unfair trade practice. So in the circumstances they are not entitled to demand any more
amount. They have not filed the copies of the completion/occupancy certificate and NOC from the
various departments as said earlier. Keeping in view the judgment of the different Hon'ble higher
courts we come to the conclusion that the complainant is entitled to the following reliefs are:-
The opposite party is liable to pay the complainant, the stamp duty levied on account of the
difference of circle rate which is Rs.1,74,240/- within 60 days from the date of judgment with
interest at a rate of 10% per annum. If the amount is not paid within 60 days from the date of
judgment, the rate of interest will be 15% per annum.
We are of the view that the complainants are entitled to get monthly damage according to the area.
The area of the said unit is less than 175 m² and keeping in view the judgment of Hon'ble NCDRC in
the case of Priyanka Mittal (supra)The complainant is entitled to get Rs.15,000/- per month towards
rent from March 2010 till July 2013 with interest at a rate of 10% per annum within 60 days from
the date of judgment. If the amount is not paid within 60 days from the date of judgment, the rate of
interest will be 15% per annum.
The complainant is entitled to get Rs.150,000/- in view of Nalin Bhargava Case (supra) as cost.
The complainant is entitled to get interest on his total deposits at the rate of 10% per annum from
01.03.2010 to 31.08.2013 and it shall be paid within 60 days from the date of this judgement and if
not paid within 60 days, the rate of interest shall be 15% per annum.

In the relief clause of the complaint, the complainant has prayed that any other relief as deemed fit
and proper in the circumstances of the case may also be granted. So keeping in view all the fraud,
unfair trade practice and deficiency in service committed in this case, all the harassment and mental
agony given to the complainant we find that the complainants are also entitled to get (cid:130) 20 lakhs
towards mental harassment, agony sufferings, course of the suit No amount shall be adjusted by the
opposite parties to these amounts whatsoever it may be.
The present complaint is decided accordingly.
ORDER The opposite party is directed to pay the complainant, the difference in the stamp duty due
to increase of circle rate which is Rs.1,74,240/- within 60 days from the date of judgment with
interest at a rate of 10% per annum. If the amount is not paid within 60 days from the date of
judgment, the rate of interest will be 15% per annum.
The opposite party is directed to pay Rs.15,000 per month towards rent from March 2010 till July
2013 with interest at a rate of 10% per annum within 60 days from the date of judgment. If the
amount is not paid within 60 days from the date of judgment, the rate of interest will be 15% per
annum.
The opposite party is directed to pay Rs.150,000/- in view of Nalin Bhargava Case (supra) as cost.
The opposite party is directed to pay interest on the total deposits of the complainant at the rate of
10% per annum from 01.03.2010 to 31.07.2013 and it shall be paid within 60 days from the date of
this judgement and if not paid within 60 days, the rate of interest shall be 15% per annum.
The opposite party is directed to pay Rs.20 lakhs to the complainant towards all the harassment and
mental agony, depression, cost of the suit within 60 days from the date of judgment without any
interest but if the amount is not paid within 60 days from the date of judgment, the rate of interest
will be 15% per annum.
No amount shall be adjusted by the opposite party to these amounts whatsoever it may be.
All the decreetal amount shall be paid within 60 days from the date of judgment of this appeal,
otherwise the opposite parties shall pay interest at a rate of 15% per annum on all the decreetal
amount. If it is not paid within 60 days from the date of judgment of this appeal, the complainant
shall be entitled to present Execution proceedings before this court at the cost of the opposite
parties.
The stenographer is requested to upload this order on the Website of this Commission today itself.
Certified copy of this judgment be provided to the parties as per rules.
