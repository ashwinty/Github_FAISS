This petition has been filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
challenging the Arbitral Award, dated 16.03.2021 passed by the Sole Arbitrator in Arb. O.P. No.1 of
2017. https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB. O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021
2.The petitioner is a Manufacturer of Solar Water Pumps. The petitioner appointed the respondent
as its Exclusive Distributor for Bihar and Jharkhand till March 31st 2015 under a Distributor
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184611817/ 1M/S.Sun Edison Solar Power India Pvt. ... vs Kumar Pramendra on 8 August, 2023
Agreement, dated 24.02.2014. Based on the Purchase Order placed by the respondent in terms of
the Distributor Agreement dated 24.02.2014, the petitioner supplied 50 numbers of Solar Water
Pumps and they have also received the sale consideration for the same from the respondent. The
respondent claims that they were unable to sell the 50 Solar Water Pumps supplied by the
petitioner, since the Solar Water Pumps were not of Sun Edison brand (petitioner's brand), as per
the Distributor Agreement, dated 24.02.2014. According to the respondent, instead of selling Sun
Edison brand, the petitioner had supplied Solar Water Pumps, which included a component
manufactured by Sakthi brand in violation of the terms and conditions of the Distributor
Agreement, dated 24.02.2014.
3. Under the Distributor Agreement dated 24.02.2014, the respondent had agreed to regularly place
orders with the petitioner for supply of Solar Water Pumps for their customers at Bihar and
Jharkhand. According to the petitioner, despite the respondent being appointed by
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB. O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021 them as its Exclusive
Distributor for Bihar and Jharkhand under the Distributor Agreement, dated 24.02.2014, the
respondent has violated the terms and conditions of the Distributor Agreement, dated 24.02.2014
by not placing orders with the petitioner regularly as per their assurance, which has resulted in loss
of projected business and profit caused to them.
4.There arose disputes between the petitioner and the respondent. The petitioner was claiming
losses on account of the failure of the respondent to place orders with the petitioner for regular
supply of Solar Water Pumps as per the Distributor Agreement, dated 24.02.2014, whereas the
respondent claims that the 50 Solar Water Pumps supplied by the petitioner could not be sold by
them in the market as they were not from Sun Edison brand (petitioner's brand). The petitioner
raised an arbitral dispute in terms of the arbitration clause contained in the Distributor Agreement.
The existence of an arbitration agreement is also not disputed by the respondent. The petitioner
made a claim arising out of the Distributor Agreement dated 24.02.2014 before the Arbitral
Tribunal for the alleged losses suffered by them on account of the alleged breach of contract
committed by the respondent by not placing orders https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB.
O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021 with the petitioner for supply of Solar Water Pumps on regular basis for

compensation for the losses suffered by them and the details are as under :

Submissions of the learned counsels :
12.Mr.Sathish Parasaran, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner after
drawing the attention of this Court to the various clauses in the Distributor
Agreement, dated 24.02.2014 and the impugned Arbitral Award, dated 16.03.2021
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184611817/ 6M/S.Sun Edison Solar Power India Pvt. ... vs Kumar Pramendra on 8 August, 2023
made the following submissions:
a) The Award is patently illegally and is liable to be set aside under Section 34(2A) of
the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 for inadequate and erroneous reasoning;
b) The Contract being one for sale of Solar Water Pumps by trade name, the learned
Arbitrator should not have inferred that there is an implied condition that all
components of the Solar Water Pumps should be manufactured by the petitioner
(Sun Edison Brand);
c) The Arbitrator failed to recognize that the title to the 50 Solar Water Pumps had
passed on to the respondent as per https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB.
O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021 law of contract and therefore, the Arbitrator has
committed patent illegality by rewriting the Contract i.e., the Distributor Agreement,
dated 24.02.2014;
d) The Arbitrator failed to see that the requirements under Section 16 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930
have been met by the petitioner. Further, the learned Arbitrator failed to see that the respondent
failed to show how the products supplied did not correspond with the sample;
e) The Arbitrator has erroneously awarded both reliance based and expectation based damages
without any evidence;
f) The Award is in conflict with public policy of India for being in violation of fundamental policy of
Indian Law;
g) Section 34(2)(b)(ii) read with explanation 1 and 2 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
gets attracted and therefore, the impugned Arbitral Award has to be set aside;
h) The Arbitrator failed to consider the respondent's act of acceptance of Solar Water Pumps and
has passed the Award in violation of Section 42 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930;
i) The Arbitrator has awarded damages in favour of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB.
O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021 respondent arbitrarily without any evidence.
13.In support of his contentions, Mr.Sathish Parasaran, learned Senior Counsel drew the attention
of this Court to the following authorities:
a) Ssangyong Engineering vs. NHAI reported in 2019 SCC Online 677;
b) Dyna Technologies Private Limited v Crompton Greaves Limited reported in 2019
20 SCC 1 ;

2020 5 SCC 164 ;
d) Mideast Pipeline Products v. Fernas Construction Co. reported in 2018 SCC Online
Del 8264;
e) Food Corporation of India vs. Chandu Construction & Another reported in 2007 4
SCC 697;
f) Hungerford Investments v. Haridas Mundhra reported in 1972 3 SCC 684;
g ) K a n c h a n U d y o g v . U n i t e d S p i r i t s r e p o r t e d i n 2 0 1 7
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB. O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021 8 SCC 237;
h) Heilbut, Symons & co. v. Buckleton reported in 1913 AC 30;
i) The Project Director, NHAI v. M Hakeem reported in 2021 9 SCC 1.
14.Relying upon the aforesaid decisions, the learned Senior counsel appearing for the petitioner
would submit that the impugned Arbitral Award has to be set aside for the following reasons :
a) The Arbitrator's view was not a plausible view;
b) The impugned Arbitral Award is an un-intelligible award and is patently illegal;
c)The impugned Arbitral Award is unjust and unfair to the petitioner;
d)The Arbitrator cannot imply a condition regarding fitness for purpose, where goods
were sold under a Trade Name;
e)It is settled principle of law that the Arbitrator being a creature of the agreement
between the parties, has to operate within the four corners of the agreement only;
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB. O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021
f)There was no termination of the Distributor Agreement by either of the parties. When the sale of
goods was through sale by sample as per Section 17 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, the respondents
failed to show before the Arbitrator as to how the 50 Solar Water Pumps supplied by the petitioner
did not correspond with the sample. Even if it was not a sale by sample, the requirements under
Section 16 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 have been met by the petitioner;
g)The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner would therefore submit that since there
was no communication from the respondent rejecting the Solar Water Pumps, it is clear that the title
of 50 numbers of Solar Water Pumps supplied by the petitioner has been transferred in favour of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184611817/ 8M/S.Sun Edison Solar Power India Pvt. ... vs Kumar Pramendra on 8 August, 2023
respondent;
(h)Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner also drew the attention of this Court to Section 42 of
the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, which makes it clear that the buyers are deemed to have accepted the
goods, once the goods have been delivered at the buyers place and the price for the goods has also
been paid;
i)Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner would further submit that this Court under Section 34 of
the Arbitration and Conciliation Act https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB. O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of
2021 cannot modify an Arbitral Award as held in the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of The Project Director, NHAI v. M Hakeem reported in 2021 9 SCC 1. According to him, the
entire Arbitral Award has to be set aside by this Court for its patent illegality under Section 34(2A)
of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
15.Per contra, Mr.C.Manishankar, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondent would
submit as follows :-
a)A perusal of the Distributor Agreement dated 24.02.2014 would show that the said
agreement shall in no way restrict the petitioner's right to directly sell the Solar
Water Pumps, though the Distributor shall use its best efforts to promote the sales
and distribution. The Distributor agreement is not a Sale Agreement. In support of
his submission, he relies upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of M/s.Kelvinator of India Ltd., vs. The State of Haryana, reported in 1973 2 SCC
551(Punjab & Haryana High Court) ;
b)50 numbers of Solar Water Pumps supplied by the petitioner to the respondent
were meant for Fisheries Department, https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB.
O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021 which could have been sold by the petitioner as they
were only by the empanelled channel Partner with the Fisheries Department and not
the respondent. Therefore, the 50 numbers of Solar Water Pumps supplied to the
respondent is not a sale attracting Section 42 of the Sale of Goods Act;
c) If the title in respect of the 50 numbers of Solar Water Pumps had passed to the respondent, the
petitioner would not be involved in the marketing of the product in Bihar and Jharkhand. The
respondent is only a Facilitator without any covenant of financial profit sharing under the
Distributor Agreement;
d)If the supply of 50 numbers of Solar Water pumps supplied by the petitioner is a private sale,
there would be no need to open an escrow account and there was no need for Mr.Chandramouli to
be appointed by the petitioner to boost the sales of the respondent. Hence, there was no transfer of
title of the 50 Solar Water Pumps in favour of the respondent;
e) Absolute breach of contract committed by the petitioner in supplying the assembled set of Pump
of Shakti Make, Solar Panels of some HSV make, after purchasing it from the local market;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184611817/ 9M/S.Sun Edison Solar Power India Pvt. ... vs Kumar Pramendra on 8 August, 2023
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB. O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021
f) Additional documents were marked by the Arbitral Tribunal only with the consent of the
petitioner and therefore, the petitioner cannot now contend that no opportunity of hearing the
objection or cross examination was permitted by the Arbitral Tribunal. Interest has been awarded in
respect of the counter claim only in accordance with Section 31(7)(a) of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996;
g) The projections arrived at and communicated by the respondent was based on the subsidy
announcements made by Bihar and Jharkhand Governments. However, when it was found that
Solar Water Pumps was an assembled product and not as promised a branded product of the
petitioner, there was a set back and since the petitioner was the perpetrator of the breach, they
cannot be permitted to make any claim against the respondent. When the petitioner has not
supplied the requisite number of pumps manufactured by them and committed breach and also not
let in any evidence, they cannot claim any loss for the alleged projected sale;
h) The respondent is entitled to the return of the sale https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB.
O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021 consideration for 50 Solar Water Pumps with interest at 18% as the
petitioner did not supply the Solar Water Pumps manufactured by Sun Edison and further they also
did not carry the Sun Edison branding as stipulated in the Distributor Agreement;
i) The compensation amounts awarded in favour of the respondent under various heads are only
based on documentary evidence produced by the respondent before the Arbitral Tribunal;
j) The view taken by the Arbitral Tribunal under the impugned award is a plausible view and is a
legal view. Hence, the same cannot be interfered with by this Court under Section 34 of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996;
16) In support of the submissions made by the learned Senior Counsel for the respondent, the
following authorities are relied upon :-
a) Project Director, National Highways Authority of India Vs. M.Hakeem and another

https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB. O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021 Discussion:

their possession, despite rejecting the same on account of the alleged non adherence of the contract
specifications by the petitioner.
18)Under Section 1 of the Distributor Agreement, dated 24.12.2014, the parties have agreed that the
collaboration between the petitioner and the respondent shall be for the following business models :
a) Private business;
b) Tender business with Distributor (respondent) as the Bidder;
c) Tender business with the petitioner as the Bidder.
19)The relevant clauses in the Distributor Agreement are as follows:
a)Section 2 of the Distributor agreement also states that the respondent shall
purchase Solar Water Pumps after paying the price for the same;
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB. O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021
b)Section 3 of the Distributor agreement states that the title to the Solar Water Pump shall pass to
the Distributor (respondent) upon receipt of full payments by the petitioner;
c)Section 5.1 of the Distributor Agreement states that the respondent shall order Solar Water Pump
by sending a written notice to the petitioner. Each order shall specify the number of units to be
shipped, the type of units to be shipped;
d)Section 5.2 of the Distributor agreement states that the criterion for acceptance of Solar Water
Pumps by the respondent shall be the successful operation of the Solar Water Pump using Sun
Edison's Standard test procedures and diagnostic test programs as applicable;
e)Section 6.3 stipulates that all the Solar Water Pumps supplied by the petitioner shall carry the
petitioner's brand name (Sun Edison) and the Distributor (respondent) shall not tamper with the
brand name without the petitioner's written permission;
f)Section 9 of the Distributor Agreement states that the duration of the Distributor Agreement is for
a period of one year, unless sooner terminated. Termination shall not relieve either party of
obligations incurred prior thereto;
g)Section 9(a) of the Distributor Agreement provides that the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
ARB. O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021 contract can be terminated by either party for substantial breach
of any material provision of the agreement by the other, provided due notice has been given for the
alleged breach and such other party has not cured the same within 30 days thereof;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184611817/ 12M/S.Sun Edison Solar Power India Pvt. ... vs Kumar Pramendra on 8 August, 2023
h)Section 15 of the Distributor Agreement states that the relationship of the parties is that of
Independent Contractors;
i)Under Section 16.6 of the Distributor Agreement, an amendment to the Distributor Agreement can
be made only by an instrument in writing signed by the parties thereto.
20) It is to be noted that both parties have not terminated the Distributor Agreement, till date in
accordance with Section 9.2. of the Distributor Agreement. It is also seen from the documents filed
by both the parties that there was no agreement entered into between the parties for amending the
terms and conditions of the Distributor Agreement. It is also to be noted that in respect of the 50
Solar Water Pumps supplied by the petitioner to the respondent, the entire sale consideration for
the same has been received by the petitioner from the respondent.
21) There are several components involved for manufacturing the final product viz., Solar Water
Pump. All the 50 Solar Water Pumps supplied by the petitioner to the respondent carry the brand
name 'Sun https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB. O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021 Edison 3000',
though one of the component in the Solar Water Pump is manufactured by Sakthi Pumps.
22)A sample of the Solar Water Pump was also sent to the respondent by the petitioner and on
receipt of the sample, the respondent through its email dated 18.04.2014 had expressed satisfaction
with the sample and also confirmed that out of the 50 Solar Water Pumps supplied by the petitioner,
the respondent has a firm commitment from their buyer for 22 numbers and another 18 is in the
pipeline.
23)The sample of the Solar Water Pump sent by the petitioner to the respondent and the 50 Solar
Water pumps supplied by the petitioner to the respondent are admittedly of the same specifications.
One of the component in both the sample as well as in the 50 Solar Water Pumps supplied by the
petitioner was manufactured by Sakthi Pumps.
24)It is to be noted that though a counter claim has been made by the respondent on the ground
that one of the component in the Solar Water Pumps is manufactured by Sakthi Pumps which
amounts to breach of contract, as seen from the email of the respondent, they themselves had
requested the petitioner to supply Kirloskar Pumps instead of Sakthi Pumps. The petitioner has also
responded to the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB. O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021 respondent's
request by their e-mail dated 07.04.2014 stating that Kirloskar Pump has failed MNRE
requirements and therefore, they cannot provide a pump, which is not meeting the MNRE
requirements.
25)The petitioner categorically contends that there has been a transfer of title in favour of the
respondent in respect of the 50 numbers of Solar Water Pumps supplied to them by the petitioner,
which has been delivered to the respondent and the sale consideration has also been received by the
petitioner. The same is disputed by the respondent, who would contend that the respondent is only
a Distributor and they acted only as a Facilitator for marketing the Solar Water Pumps in the State
of Bihar and Jharkhand. It is also their contention that by misrepresentation, the petitioner had
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184611817/ 13M/S.Sun Edison Solar Power India Pvt. ... vs Kumar Pramendra on 8 August, 2023
delivered 50 numbers of Solar Water Pumps in which one of the components is manufactured by
Sakthi Pump which is in violation of terms and conditions of the Distributor agreement as the
petitioner, agreed to purchase Sun Edison brand (petitioner) only.
26)Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 deals with assessment of unliquidated damages. The
explanation to the said Section makes it clear that any person making a claim for unliquidated
damages https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB. O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021 will have to first
mitigate the loss. Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act reads as follows:
'73.Compensation for loss or damage caused by breach of contract - When a contract
has been broken, the party who suffers by such breach is entitled to receive, from the
party who has broken the contract, compensation for any loss or damage caused to
him thereby, which naturally arose in the usual course of things from such breach, or
which the parties knew, when they made the contract, to be likely to result from the
breach of it.
Such compensation is not to be given for any remote and indirect loss or damage
sustained by reason of the breach.
Compensation for failure to discharge obligation resembling those created by
contract - When an obligation resembling those created by contract has been
incurred and has not been discharged, any person injured by the failure to discharge
it is entitled to receive the same compensation from the party in default, as if such
person had contracted to discharge it and had broken his contract.
Explanation - In estimating the loss or damage arising from a breach of contract, the
means which existed of remedying the inconvenience caused by the non-performance
of the contract must be taken into account.' https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB.
O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021
27) In the case on hand, though the respondent seeks for recession of the sale in
respect of 50 Solar Water Pumps which has been supplied by the petitioner and for
which sale consideration has already been paid by the respondent, neither the
pleadings of the respondent nor the documentary evidence produced by them, which
have been marked as Exhibits before the Arbitral Tribunal as 'R' Series, disclose the
steps taken by the respondent to mitigate its losses considering the fact that the 50
Solar Water Pumps supplied by the petitioner are still available and are kept idle.
Both the parties have also not let in oral evidence to substantiate their respective
claims for unliquidated damages. The major part of the claim made by both the
parties involve claims for unliquidated damages, which fall under Section 73 of the
Indian Contract Act.
28)The Sole Arbitrator under the impugned Arbitral Award has also not dealt with
mitigation of losses as required by the respondent (buyer) to be done in terms of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184611817/ 14M/S.Sun Edison Solar Power India Pvt. ... vs Kumar Pramendra on 8 August, 2023
explanation to Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. The explanation to
Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 makes it mandatory for any claimant to
mitigate its loss and only thereafter seek claim towards unliquidated damages.
Having not https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB. O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021
disclosed in the pleadings or through documentary evidence, the steps taken by the
respondent for mitigating its alleged losses by either selling the 50 Solar Water
Pumps delivered to them to third parties or through any other means, the Arbitrator
has committed a patent illegality. By total non of application of mind to the
explanation to Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 which deals with
mitigation of losses, the Arbitral Tribunal even without any oral or documentary
evidence has awarded unliquidated damages to the respondent without granting any
opportunity for the petitioner to dispute the same by way of cross examination of the
respondent's witness. The Arbitrator on its own, by an absolute perverse finding, has
arbitrarily based on a counter claim for unliquidated damages made by the
respondent under various heads, has erroneously awarded compensation in favour of
the respondent, though a higher sum was sought for under various heads. No
opportunity was granted by the Arbitrator to the petitioner to rebut the payment of
the compensation to the respondent through oral and documentary evidence. The
claim for unliquidated damages without sufficient material cannot be accepted. The
alleged loss of business or profit for the years attributed only to the petitioner is also
unsupported by any material in the arbitration. While the quantum of evidence
required to accept a claim may be a matter https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB.
O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021 within the exclusive jurisdiction of the arbitrator to
decide, if there was no evidence at all and if the arbitrator makes an award of the
amount claimed in the counter claim, merely on the basis of the counter claim,
without anything more, it has to be held that the award on that account would be
invalid. The aspect of taking effective steps by the respondent to mitigate its losses
was not considered at all by the arbitrator. The law of mitigation under Section 34 of
the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, cannot be overlooked by the Court, when
such award is challenged on the merit itself. The loss of profit claims always have a
foundation of net loss and not only the estimated gross profit, without supporting
accounts and material, the award so granted is patently illegal as it is without any
settled foundation. In the impugned arbitral award, without any estimation of the
actual loss sustained by the respondent, the arbitrator has awarded compensation
towards unliquidated damages. Any assessment of damages on undisclosed or
unknown formula or principle falls within the ambit of error of law and contrary to
the contract and the law and therefore, it is unsustaiable.
29)The Sole Arbitrator has awarded certain sums of money as compensation towards
un-liquidated damages in favour of the respondent https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
ARB. O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021 without any oral evidence. Any claim for
un-liquidated damages which is not supported by any documentary evidence will
certainly require oral evidence. The oral evidence is vital for passing a
judgment/award in most of the cases. In a case involving a claim for unliquidated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184611817/ 15M/S.Sun Edison Solar Power India Pvt. ... vs Kumar Pramendra on 8 August, 2023
damages, where there is no clinching evidence for proving the same, oral evidence is
mandatory. The parties to the dispute namely, the petitioner and the respondent have
not let in oral evidence before the Arbitrator. Only based on the pleadings and
documentary evidence, without there being proof for the actual losses suffered by
both the parties, the Arbitrator has awarded compensation to the respondent by
partly allowing the counter claim and by fixing the quantum of compensation on his
own arbitrarily. The object of cross examination are to impeach the accuracy,
credibility, and the general value of the evidence given in chief; to sift the facts
already stated by the witness, to detect and expose discrepancies, or to elicit
suppressed facts that will support the case of the cross-examining party. The
Honourable Supreme Court in the case of Juwar Singh Vs. The State of Madhya
Pradesh reported in AIR 1981 SC 373, observed that "where the facts are in dispute,
such cases, generally speaking, are proved by human testimony. The value of the
testimony depends on the honesty of the witness, his means of knowledge, his
memory, his intelligence and his https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB.
O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021 impartiality. Every question is relevant which goes to
indicate the presence or absence of these qualities or any of them. The arbitrator
under the impugned award has arbitrarily awarded compensation towards
unliquidated damages to the respondent without any oral evidence based on his own
assessment and not based on any material evidence.
30.There are several clauses in the Distributor Agreement, dated 24.02.2014 which is of relevance to
the subject matter of the dispute:
a)Section 1 of the Distributor Agreement, dated 24.02.2014 makes it clear that the
collaboration between the petitioner and the respondent shall be for three business
models and one of them is 'private business'.
b)Private business makes the Distributor (respondent) completely responsible for
finding customers. In the instant case, the purchase order was placed by the
respondent on 24.02.2014 (Ex.R5) with the petitioner and it does not refer to
a)tender business with the respondent (Distributor) as the bidder or b)tender
business with the petitioner as the bidder which are the other models of collaboration
between the petitioner and the respondent available under the Distributor
Agreement. Therefore, it is clear that the sale of 50 Solar Water Pumps by the
petitioner to the respondent is a deal falling within the purview of “private business”,
as https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB. O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021 defined in
Section 1 of the Distributor Agreement. As observed earlier, in respect of private
business, the Distributor (respondent) shall be completely responsible for finding
customers and for installation and maintenance of Solar Water Pumps.
31)Section 3 of the Distributor Agreement makes it clear that the title of the Solar
Water Pump supplied by the petitioner to the respondent shall pass to the
respondent (Distributor) only upon receipt of the full payment. In the case on hand,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184611817/ 16M/S.Sun Edison Solar Power India Pvt. ... vs Kumar Pramendra on 8 August, 2023
admittedly, the entire payment has been made by the respondent to the petitioner for
the 50 Solar Water Pumps supplied by the petitioner.
32) Section 42 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 makes it clear that the buyer is deemed
to have accepted the goods when he has intimated to the seller that he has accepted
them. Section 42 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 reads as follows :
42. Acceptance.—The buyer is deemed to have accepted the goods when he intimates
to the seller that he has accepted them, or when the goods have been delivered to him
and he does any act in relation to them which is inconsistent with the ownership of
the seller, or when, after the lapse of a reasonable time, he retains the goods without
intimating to the seller that he has rejected them.
33) As seen from the impugned Arbitral Award, Section 42 of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
ARB. O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021 Sale of Goods Act, 1930 which deals with acceptance was never
considered by the Sole Arbitrator which is vital for deciding as to whether there was a transfer of
title in respect of the 50 Solar Water Pumps in favour of the respondent or not. In the case on hand,
the petitioner had sent the sample of Solar Water Pump to the respondent. It is also an admitted fact
that the sample of the Solar Water Pump sent by the petitioner, matched with the specifications of
the 50 Solar Water Pumps supplied by the petitioner to the respondent. The same is confirmed by E-
mail, dated 18.04.2014 viz., Ex.C8. Infact in Ex.C8, the respondent has confirmed that the output
and functionality of the demo pump has been excellent and that prospective buyers numbering
around 150 to 200 have shown interest in the product of the petitioner.
34) Now, when it comes to ensuring the quality of fitness of goods being sold by the seller
(petitioner), there is no implied condition for it, except for some exceptional cases, which have been
mentioned in Section 16 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. There being no actual protection for general
cases of such defaults, the Section brings the common law rule of "caveat emptor" into the
discussion, which basically means 'buyer beware'. This rule implies that when a buyer gets involved
in a contract of https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB. O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021 sale / purchase
with the seller, it becomes the job of the buyer to ensure that the goods are as per the requirement
and is in a proper condition at the time of the purchase. This rule puts the obligation on the buyer to
be certain of the quality of the goods by examining them thoroughly.
35) Under Section 16 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, there is no implied warranty or condition as to
the quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied under a contract of sale, if the
buyer has examined the goods. In the case on hand, the demo pump was sent to the respondent by
the petitioner and the petitioner had also acknowledged that the demo pump is functioning properly
and there are several prospective buyers who may be interested in the product. Therefore, Section 16
of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 which deals with implied conditions as to the quality of fitness is a
provision of law which necessarily requires consideration for the purpose of adjudicating as to
whether the petitioner being a seller has committed breach of contract or not under the Distributor
Agreement, dated 24.02.2014. None of the Clauses in the Distributor Agreement stipulates that all
the components of the Solar Water Pump should be manufactured by the petitioner. The only
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184611817/ 17M/S.Sun Edison Solar Power India Pvt. ... vs Kumar Pramendra on 8 August, 2023
condition stipulated in the Distributor Agreement is that the brand
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB. O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021 name of the product namely,
the Solar Water Pump should be from the Sun Edison Brand. Admittedly, the brand name of the 50
Solar Water Pumps are from Sun Edison Brand. A product will have to be manufactured by using
several raw materials/components. Unless and until the agreement stipulates that all the raw
materials/components should be manufactured by a particular manufacturer, it cannot be implied,
as seen from Section 16 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, that the Contract makes it mandatory for the
petitioner to sell only Solar Water Pumps to the respondent comprising of components only
manufactured by the petitioner and no one else. Infact the respondent being aware of the terms and
conditions of the Distributor Agreement had themselves requested the petitioner to use Kirloskar
Pumps as a component of the Solar Water Pump to be supplied by the petitioner to the respondent.
Section 16 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 is extracted hereunder :-
16. Implied conditions as to quality or fitness.— Subject to the provisions of this Act
and of any other law for the time being in force, there is no implied warranty or
condition as to the quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied
under a contract of sale, except as follows:— (1) Where the buyer, expressly or by
implication, makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are
required, so as to show that the buyer relies on the seller’s skill or
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB. O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021 judgment, and
the goods are of a description which it is in the course of the seller’s business to
supply (whether he is the manufacturer or producer or not), there is an implied
condition that the goods shall be reasonably fit for such purpose:
Provided that, in the case of a contract for the sale of a specified article under its
patent or other trade name, there is no implied condition as to its fitness for any
particular purpose.
(2) Where goods are bought by description from a seller who deals in goods of that
description (whether he is the manufacturer or producer or not), there is an implied
condition that the goods shall be of merchantable quality:
Provided that, if the buyer has examined the goods, there shall be no implied
condition as regards defects which such examination ought to have revealed.
(3) An implied warranty or condition as to quality or fitness for a particular purpose
may be annexed by the usage of trade.
(4) An express warranty or condition does not negative a warranty or condition
implied by this Act unless inconsistent therewith.
36)Section 17 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 which deals with sale by sample also
makes it clear that in case of a contract for sale by a sample, there is an implied
condition that the bulk shall correspond to the sample in quality. In the case on hand,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184611817/ 18M/S.Sun Edison Solar Power India Pvt. ... vs Kumar Pramendra on 8 August, 2023
the supply of 50 Solar Water Pumps effected by the petitioner matched with the
specifications of the https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB. O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of
2021 demo pump which was a sample sent by the petitioner to the respondent for
demonstration purposes. The respondent has also acknowledged by its e-mail that
the demo pump is an excellent product and that there are many other prospective
buyers who are interested in the said product.
The petitioner has also claimed before the arbitrator that they had no problem with other
distributors of the very same product having the very same specifications with regard to other
States. No evidence has also been produced by the respondent to rebut the contentions of the
petitioner. The sole arbitrator has not considered Section 17 of the Sale of Goods Act, before
awarding unliquidated damages in favour of the respondent.
37) The Arbitrator in the impugned Arbitral Award has not considered Sections 16, 17 and 42 of the
Sale of Goods Act, 1930 in the proper perspective while adjudicating the dispute between the
parties. If Sections 16, 17 and 42 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 were taken into consideration by the
Sole Arbitrator, there is a possibility that the unliquidated damages claim of the respondent against
the petitioner may fail.
38) For the foregoing reasons, this Court is of the considered view https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis
ARB. O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021 that the impugned Arbitral Award has to be set aside by this Court
for the following reasons:
a) Arbitrarily, the Sole Arbitrator without any evidence has awarded compensation
under various heads to the respondent towards unliquidated damages based on
surmises and conjectures;
b) Arbitrarily, the Sole Arbitrator without any oral evidence has partly allowed the
counter claim of the respondent by awarding compensation towards unliquidated
damages;
c) Section 16, 17 and 42 of Sale of Goods Act has not been considered by the Sole
Arbitrator and if they were considered, there is a possibility that the petitioner may
not be liable to pay compensation to the respondent;
d) Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act has not been considered by the Sole
Arbitrator in the proper perspective. If the explanation to Section 73 of the Indian
Contract Act was considered by the Sole Arbitrator in the proper perspective, the
counter claim made by the respondent against the petitioner may not have been
allowed as the explanation makes it clear that only after mitigation of losses, the
respondent can make a claim for unliquidated damages against the petitioner;
https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB. O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/184611817/ 19M/S.Sun Edison Solar Power India Pvt. ... vs Kumar Pramendra on 8 August, 2023
e)The Award suffers from patent illegality attracting Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation
Act as the determination of the compensation by the Arbitrator is unintelligible without any basis
and without any supporting oral or documentary evidence.
39) The decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner referred to supra makes it
clear that the impugned Award suffers from patent illegality and it has to be set aside by this Court.
However, to determine whether any breach of contract has been committed by the petitioner or the
respondent and whether compensation is payable to any of them and for what amount under
various heads, parties will have to be granted liberty to initiate fresh arbitration in accordance with
law. The impugned arbitral award is set aside only on the ground that the compensation awarded by
the arbitrator towards unliquidated damages in favour of the respondent is not supported by any
evidence and the award is an unintelligible award.
40. In the result, the impugned arbitral award dated 16.03.2021 passed in Arb. O.P. No.1 of 2017 is
hereby set aside and this petition is allowed by granting liberty to both the parties to initiate fresh
arbitration towards their respective claim in accordance with law. The period spent before the
arbitration which culminated in the passing of the impugned https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis ARB.
O.P.(Com.Div) No.1 of 2021 arbitral award till the date of receipt of a copy of this order shall be
excluded for the purpose of limitation under Section 14 of the Limitation Act. No costs.
Consequently, connected application is closed.
