CIVIL REVISIONAL JURISDICTION
APPELLATE SIDE
BEFORE:
The Hon'ble Justice SAHIDULLAH MUNSHI
C.O. No. 2587 of 2010
TEJ BAHADUR THAPA
... Petitioner
-Versus-
BRANCH MANAGER OF DISTRICT CENTRAL
CO-OPERATIVE BANK LTD. & ANR.
... Respondents/Opposite Parties
Mr. Siddhartha Banerjee, ... For the petitioner Mr. Pabitra Charan Bhattacharjee, Mr. Subhajit Panja
... For the opposite parties.
Heard on : 05.07.2016, 02.08.2016, 08.08.2016.
Judgment on : August 22, 2016.
Sahidullah Munshi, J.:-
At the beginning of the hearing learned Advocate Mr. Prabitra Charan Bhattacharjee, appearing for
the opposite parties, raised a preliminary objection that in view of Section 21 of the Consumer
Protection Act, 1986, this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain a revision under Article 227 of the
Constitution usurping the jurisdiction of the National Commission.
In this context, it is necessary to take into consideration of the provisions of Section 21 of the
Consumer Protection Act, 1986 which is quoted below :-
"Section 21... Sub-Section (b) gives power and jurisdiction to the National
Commission to call for the records and pass appropriate orders in any consumer
dispute which is pending before or has been decided by any State Commission, if it
appears to the National Commission that such State Commission has exercised a
jurisdiction not vested in it by law. The Commission may also scrutinize if the State
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126853918/ 1Unknown vs Branch Manager Of District ... on 22 August, 2016
Commission has failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested, or has acted illegally or
with material irregularity in the exercise of jurisdiction." Article 227 of the
Constitution of India is also quoted below :- "Article 227. Power of superintendence
over all courts by the High Court - [(1) Every High Court shall have superintendence
over all courts and tribunals throughout the territories in relation to which it
exercises jurisdiction.] (2) Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing
provision, the High Court may -
a) call for returns from such courts;
b) make and issue general rules and prescribe forms for regulating the practice and
proceedings of such courts; and
c) prescribe forms in which books, entries and accounts shall be kept by the officers
of any such courts.
(3) The High Court may also settle tables of fees to be allowed to the sheriff and all
clerks and officers of such courts and to attorneys, advocates and pleaders practising
therein:
Provided that any rules made, forms prescribed or tables settled under clause (2) or
clause (3) shall not be inconsistent with the provision of any law for the time being in
force and shall require the previous approval of the Governor.
(4) Nothing in this article shall be deemed to confer on a High Court powers of
superintendence over any court or tribunal constituted by or under any law relating
to the Armed Forces."
The Provisions in Section 21 - "... The Commission may also scrutinize if the State Commission has
failed to exercise a jurisdiction..." does not, in any way, curtail the power under clause (1) of Article
227 of the Constitution. On a close scrutiny it further appears, and can be interpreted that even a
decision passed by the National Commission under Section 21 of the Consumer Protection Act,
1986, is also amenable to the superintending power of a High Court having territorial jurisdiction
over the same. If that be so, why a party, in a given case, according to his convenience, cannot obtain
relief under Article 227 of the Constitution, against an order of the State Commission. On further
scrutiny of the provisions, as aforesaid, it appears that if for an aggrieved party two options for
revisions are provided for by law, one under ordinary Statute and the other under the Constitution
itself, it is the choice of the party suffering prejudice by the order aggrieved by.
To strike down usurpation of office is the function and duty of High Courts in exercise of their
constitutional powers under Article 226 and Article 227. Article 227 is not merely procedural but
confers substantive right on litigant to move High Court against the decisions or orders of Tribunals.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126853918/ 2Unknown vs Branch Manager Of District ... on 22 August, 2016
It is true that High Court will not review the discretion of the authority judicially exercised but it
may interfere, if the exercise of the discretion is capricious or perverse.
As held by the Apex Court in the case of Jugal Kishore vs. Sitamarhi Central Co-operative reported
in AIR 1967 SC 1494 Article 227 is of wider ambit than Article 226 and it does not limit the
jurisdiction of the High Court to the hierarchy of Courts functioning directly under it under Civil
Procedure Code and Criminal Procedure Code but it gives the High Court power to correct errors of
various kinds of all Courts and Tribunals in appropriate cases.
In support of the objection with regard to the jurisdiction of the High Court to entertain a revisional
application under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, Mr. Bhattacharjee, appearing for the
opposite parties in his preliminary objection, relied upon some judgments which are as follows :-
• Ravi Kant Srivastava vs. Ashok Kr. Chakraborty reported in (2016) 3 WBLR (Cal)
160.
• Nivedita Sharma vs. Cellular Operators Association of India & Ors. reported in
(2012) 2 WBLR (SC) 38.
• The Manager, Burdwan Co-operative Agriculture and Rural Development Bank
Limited vs. Anath Bandhu Dhara reported in 2009(2) CLJ (Cal) 685.
• Nilmoni Mukherjee & Ors. vs. Asim Kumar Chattopadhyay & Anr. reported in
2008(1) CLJ (Cal) 892.
• Hooghly Co-operative Agriculture and Rural Development Bank Limited vs. Nemai
Chandra Ghosh reported in AIR 2007 CAL 230.
• Binod Behari Das vs. Smt. Soma Roy & Ors. reported in AIR 1996 CAL 231.
• United Bank of India vs. Hirak Mukherjee & Ors. reported in 1995(1) CLJ 124.
• Visva Bharati vs. Smt. Rakhi Debnath & Ors. reported in 1995(2) CLJ 218.
In Ravi Kant Srivastava vs. Ashok Kr. Chakraborty (supra), a Single Bench of this Hon'ble Court,
while answering to the question of maintainability of the revisional application before this Court
under the provisions of Article 227 of the Constitution of India has held that High Court should not
entertain a petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India against the order of a State
Commission while so holding the learned Single Judge relied on another judgment in the case of
Nivedita Sharma vs. Cellular Operators Association of India & Ors. (supra), which held redressal of
grievance by way of writ petition should not be entertained ignoring statutory dispensation.
In the case of The Manager, Burdwan Co-operative Agricultural and Rural Development Bank
Limited vs. Anath Bandhu Dhara (supra), a Single Bench of this Hon'ble Court has held that when
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126853918/ 3Unknown vs Branch Manager Of District ... on 22 August, 2016
the remedy available under the statute that remedy should be exhausted and before exhausting that
remedy, petition under Article 227 cannot be entertained. In the said judgment some decisions of
the Hon'ble Apex Court has been referred to but no discussion has been made as to whether those
judgments have laid down any law as to the total bar for entertaining a revisional application against
the order passed by the National State Commission.
In the case of Nilmoni Mukherjee vs. Asim Kr. Chattopadhyay & Anr. (supra), a Single Bench of this
Hon'ble Court held that a party aggrieved by an order passed under Consumer Protection Act should
not approach the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution. The said decision, however, is
based on the issue whether a party can approach before this Hon'ble Court under Article 227
ignoring the provisions of Section 19 of the Consumer Protection Act, which provides for an appeal
before the National Commission but not with regard to the power of revision by the State
Commission under Section 21 of the Consumer Protection Act. Therefore, ratio of the judgment in
the said case is not applicable and is distinguishable on fact.
In the case of Hooghly Co-operative Agricultural and Rural Development Bank Limited vs. Nemai
Chandra Ghosh (supra), a Single Bench of this Hon'ble Court held that since an appeal has been
prescribed before Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission under Section 15 of the Consumer
Protection Act, the petition under Article 227 is not maintainable. The said decision is also on a
different question and is not applicable in the present case.
In the case of Binod Behari Das vs. Smt. Soma Ray & Ors. (supra), a Single Bench of this Hon'ble
Court held that since the appeal has been prescribed under Consumer Protection Act, no revision
under Article 227 could be filed. Therefore, this case is also distinguishable on fact and its scope.
In the case of United Bank of India vs. Hirak Mukherjee & Ors. (supra), the Division Bench of this
Hon'ble Court held that when on examination of the facts and circumstances of the case, no mistake
can be found so as to attract Article 227 of the Constitution making it a fit case for interference, the
petitioner should have gone before the National Commission instead of filing a revisional
application under Article 227 of the Constitution. The Division Bench has distinguished the scope of
interference with the order passed by the State Commission under Section 21 of the Consumer
Protection Act and under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. The Division Bench held that if the
petitioner can make out a case or the error of such that has been committed by the State
Commission then only a petition under Article 227 would be held to be maintainable, otherwise the
petitioner has to go before the appellate forum within the meaning of Section 19 of the Consumer
Protection Act. It has also been held that the scope under Section 19 of the Consumer Protection Act
is more wider than scope of the petition under Article 227 of the Constitution. In the present case as
would appear later that State Commission's finding suffers from perversity inasmuch as without
discussing the evidence on record, it has held that Forum's finding is not based on evidence.
In the case of Visva Bharati vs. Smt. Rakhi Debnath & Ors. (supra), a Single Bench of this Hon'ble
Court with reference to the scope of Section 21 of the Consumer Protection Act held that when the
Act clearly makes a provision for appeal against the order of District Forum before the State
Commission and even the decision of the State Commission can be challenged in revision before the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126853918/ 4Unknown vs Branch Manager Of District ... on 22 August, 2016
National Commission, the aggrieved party without exhausting such remedy, ordinarily, should not
be allowed to raise disputed question of facts by invoking the power of the High Court under Article
226 of the Constitution. Therefore, this judgment has got no application in the facts and
circumstances of the present case.
To contradict the objection with regard to the maintainability of the petition under Article 227 of the
Constitution, Mr. Banerjee, appearing for the petitioner, has placed reliance upon the following
decisions :-
• Judgment and order dated 20th January, 2016 passed in the case of Bhaskar Jalan
& Anr. vs. M/s. Housing Estates Pvt. Ltd. & Ors. (C.O. No. 4158 of 2015).
• Judgment and order dated 20th January, 2014 passed in the case of L & T Finance
Ltd. vs. Anup Kumar Bera & Anr. (C.O. No. 3020 of 2012).
• Judgment and order dated 7th March, 2012 passed in the case of The Operation
Manager, Auto Loan Consumer Service Department, ABN Amro Bank Ltd. vs.
Praveen Khaitan & Anr. (C.O. No. 749 of 2008 with CAN No. 6414 of 2011). In the
case of Bhaskar Jalan and Anr. vs. M/s. Housing Estates Pvt.
Ltd. and Ors. (supra), a Single Bench of this Hon'ble Court, while deciding a revisional application
against an order passed by State Consumer Redressal Commission in exercise of its power under
Section 17(1)(b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and the preliminary objection with regard to
maintainability of the revisional application before this Court under Article 227 of the Constitution,
has held -
"...There is a fundamental distinction between a statutory power and a constitutional power. There
cannot be any limitations on constitutional power. The limitations, if any, are self-imposed. While
statutes are seasonal, the Constitution is perennial. The power exercised by the Court under Article
227 of the Constitution of India is a power bestowed upon the Court by the Constitution and such
power cannot be curtailed by any statutes. All the Courts in the jurisdiction of a High Court are
subordinate to it and subject to its control and supervision under Article 227 of the Constitution of
India. While appellate or revisional jurisdiction is regulated by the statutes, the power of
superintendents under Article 227 of the Constitution is constitutional. The Court under Article 227
of the Constitution of India may interfere with an order passed by the Subordinate Court or Tribunal
if the Court finds that the reasons given by the Trial Court are moonshine, flimsy or irrational and
not merely because in the exercise of its discretion, another Court might have a different view and
allowed the application or because the reasons for giving a ruling on a point or for rejecting an
application may be wrong or disclosed a non-judicious exercise of discretion and open to correction
in an appeal. The power under Article 227 of the Constitution being a power of judicial
superintendents must be exercised sparingly and only to keep Subordinate Courts and Tribunals
within the bound of their authority and not to correct mere errors. Moreover, where the statute
bears the exercise of revisional powers it would require very exceptional circumstances to warrant
interference under Article 227 of the Constitution since the power of superintendents was not meant
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126853918/ 5Unknown vs Branch Manager Of District ... on 22 August, 2016
to circumvent statutory law. The said power could not be exercised "as the cloak of an appeal in
disguise". Ordinarily when a statutory forum is created by law for redressal of grievance and that
too, in a fiscal statute, the Court may not exercise its supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 of
the Constitution of India. It is misnomer to say that a statutory power debars a Constitutional Court
from exercising its jurisdiction under the Constitution. The Court imposes a self- restriction on its
power while discharging its function under the Constitution if there is an efficacious alternative
remedy available in law to a litigant..."
In L & T Finance Ltd. vs. Anup Kr. Bera and Anr. (supra), a Single Bench of this Hon'ble Court,
while considering the point of maintainability of a petition under Article 227 of the Constitution
against an order passed by the Station Commission, has held -
"... The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is enacted to protect the common man from wrongs where
the remedy under the common law has become illusory. Under the said Act, a consumer is entitled
to participate in a proceeding directly and is helpless against the power business house is sufficiently
taken care off. The Consumer can very well ventilate his grievance before the Forum without any
procedural wrangles and hypertechnicalities. The Forum also correspondingly owes responsibility to
adjudicate on summary trial to serve the ends of justice not only in the form of damages but to bring
a change in the attitude of service provider qualitatively. The Forum cannot absolve itself from
providing the reasons to avoid the chance of arbitrariness and to provide the higher forum to test
the correctness thereof. In the above perspective, the observation of the three judge bench of the
Supreme Court in case of Vishwabharathi House Building Coop. Society (supra) can be safely relied
upon which reads thus:
"39. The rights of the parties have adequately been safeguarded by reason of the provisions of the
said Act inasmuch as although it provides for an alternative system of consumer jurisdiction on
summary trial, they are required to arrive at a conclusion based on reasons. Even when quantifying
damages, they are required to make an attempt to serve the ends of justice aiming not only at
recompensing the individual but also to bring about a qualitative change in the attitude of the
service provider. Assignment of reasons excludes or at any rate minimizes the chances of
arbitrariness and the higher forums created under the Act can test the correctness thereof."
The impugned order is bereft of any reasons. The District Forum dismisses the complaint case solely
on the ground of having approached the Civil Court. There was no finding recorded by the District
Forum which obviously should not be done on the findings relating to the grant of compensation
and/or damages. The State Commission while arriving at the finding that the order of the District
Forum is not sustainable awarded the compensation and/or damages as claimed in the said
complaint petition without recording any findings thereupon. It is still unknown at least from the
impugned order as to what evidence and/or materials were produced by the opposite party no.1 on
an issue relating to the compensation and/or damages. The State Commission should have scanned
the evidence and the documents produced on the issue of the compensation and/or damages and
the quantum thereof..."

While deciding the point of maintainability, The Hon'ble Judge also considered the judgment in the
case of Nivedita Sharma vs. Cellular Operators Association of India and Ors.(supra), Operation
Manager, Auto Loan Consumer Service Department, ABN Amro Bank Ltd. vs. Prabin Khaitan and
Anr. (supra). The Hon'ble Judge has also considered the case of State of Karnataka vs.
Vishwabharathi Housing Building Co-operative Society & Ors. reported in (2003) 2 SCC 412. In the
said judgment the Hon'ble Judge has also categorically pointed out the provisions of Section 3 of the
West Bengal Consumer Protection Act, to the effect that it supplements and not supplants the
jurisdiction of the civil Court or other statutory forum. The word "not in derogation of" used in
Section 3 of the Consumer Protection Act, makes it clear that the provisions of the Act shall not be in
derogation of the provisions of any other law for the time being in force. This shows that the
legislature has intended to mean that Consumer Protection Act shall not supersede the existing laws
available to the consumers on the date of the commencement of the said Act. A judgment in the case
of State of Karnataka vs. Vishwabharathi Housing Building Co-operative Society & Ors. (supra), is a
3-Judge Bench judgment and on the basis of the ratio decided in the said judgment, His Lordship
held that the power of the High Court under Article 226 or 227 of the Constitution has not been
taken away because of the alternative efficacious remedy provided in the statute.
In the case of Operation Manager, Auto Loan Consumer Service Department, ABN Amro Bank Ltd.
vs. Prabin Khaitan and Anr. (supra), an Hon'ble Single Judge, decided the issue regarding
maintainability of the revisional application under Article 227 of the Constitution and held in the
affirmative that the revisional application is maintainable. However, this judgment has been
referred to by the Hon'ble Judge in the subsequent judgment dated 20th January, 2014. In view of
the ratio decided by the Hon'ble Judge in the case of Operation Manager, Auto Loan Consumer
Service Department, ABN Amro Bank Ltd. vs. Prabin Khaitan and Anr. (supra), and the ratio
decided by another Hon'ble Judge in the case of Bhaskar Jalan and Anr. vs. M/s. Housing Estates
Pvt. Ltd. and Ors. (supra), this Court is judicially bound to hold that the present revisional
application is very much maintainable before this Court, particularly, when this Court is, prima
facie, satisfied on the merit of the case that the finding arrived at by the State Commission is
perverse. I have got this opportunity because the revisional application was heard on merit
including the question of maintainability.
This revisional application is directed against an order dated 19th April, 2010 passed by the learned
State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in S.C. Case No. FA/46/2010, allowing the appeal
and setting aside the judgment and order passed by the Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in
complaint no. 32/D/2009.
The petitioner herein filed an application before the District Consumer Redressal Forum at
Darjeeling on the alleged deficiency of service on the part of the opposite parties under Section 15 of
the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (hereinafter referred to as the said Act), inter alia, praying for a
direction upon the opposite parties for clearance of cheque amounting Rs.7,00,000/- only, in favour
of the complainant together with a compensation of Rs. 1,00,000/- only, to be paid to the
complainant by the opposite parties on account of mental harassment and agony caused by the
opposite parties to the complainant and a sum of Rs.50,000/- only, as exemplary cost for the alleged
deficiency and negligence in service by the opposite parties.

The short case that was made out by the petitioner in his complaint before the District Consumer
Disputes Redressal Forum (hereinafter to be called as the said Forum) is that a cheque bearing
No.57979 dated 22nd September, 2009 for Rs.7,50,000/- only, drawn at State Bank of India,
Siliguri, which was issued by the Chief Executive Engineer, NHPC, Kalimpong in favour of the
Chairman, Samthar Agricultural Multipurpose Co-operative Society (hereinafter referred to as the
SAMCO) towards the part compensation out of a total compensation amount of Rs. 31,00,000/-
only, payable by the NHPC to the SAMCO. The Chairman, SAMCO was operating his account with
the opposite party no. 1, i.e, Branch Manager, District Central Co-operative Branch, Kalimpong, Dal
Bahadurgiri Road, P.S.-Kalimpong, District-Darjeeling, being Account No. S/82, N.F. No. 147/53 as
such the said Chairman deposited the aforesaid cheque bearing no. 57979 dated 22nd September,
2009 for the aforesaid sum of Rs. 7,50,000/- only, with the opposite party on 23rd September, 2009
for clearance from the State Bank of India, Siliguri. The said cheque for the said amount was cleared
by the State Bank of India, Siliguri through the State Bank of India at Kalimpong and the aforesaid
amount was lying in the account of SAMCO with the opposite party no. 1. On 23rd September, 2009,
the Chairman, SAMCO, Kalimpong issued a cheque bearing no. 210276 dated 23rd September,
2009, for a sum of Rs. 7,00,000/- only, in favour of the complainant. The complainant presented
the said cheque bearing no. 210276 dated 23rd September, 2009 for the said sum of Rs. 7,00,000/-
only, with the State Bank of India Kalimpong Branch, where the complainant operates his account,
on 23rd September, 2009 for clearance from the opposite party no. 1. The Complainant,
subsequently, came to know that the said cheque bearing No.210276 dated 23rd September, 2009
for Rs. 7,00,000/- only, was not cleared by the opposite party no.1 on some pretext. The
complainant approached the opposite parties for the clearance of the said cheque for payment from
the State Bank of India, Kalimpong Branch but the opposite parties withheld the clearance of the
said cheque and, as a result, no payment was made to the complainant on the basis of the cheque
issued by the Chairman, SAMCO in favour of the complainant. Therefore, the complaint was filed
before the said Forum with the aforesaid prayers. While filing the said complaint, the petitioner
herein as complainant filed several documents in support of his claim. The opposite parties filed a
written objection and, inter alia, contended that the cheque for a sum of Rs.7,00,000/- only, was
sent to the Branch of the opposite party no.1 for collection by the State Bank of India and the same
was not cleared for payment on the grounds that on verification of the records it was found that a
letter of objection against payment of the said cheque in question was submitted by one STI & Co.,
27th Mile SAMCO ropeway, NH 31A, Reang, District- Darjeeling under a memo dated 24th
September, 2009. In view of the objection so raised, the Bank kept the payment in abeyance. It was
further contended that a copy of the stop payment request addressed to the Chairman, SAMCO by
one Rajiv Pradhan and Sri Subhas Singh was submitted to the opposite party no. 1, which compelled
the said opposite party no. 1 to disallow clearance and payment of the cheque in question. The
cheque in question was returned by the opposite party no.1 to State Bank of India on 6th October,
2006 with return slip stating reasons clearly written on the return slip no. 16 and 17. After
considering the documents filed by the complainant and the contentions raised by the complainant
and the opposite parties, the District Forum disposed of the complaint finally by its order dated 24th
December, 2009. While disposing of the complaint, the said Forum framed the following issues, viz.,
1. Is the complainant consumer under Section 2(d) of Consumer Protection Act, 1986?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126853918/ 8Unknown vs Branch Manager Of District ... on 22 August, 2016
2. Does the Forum have jurisdiction to try the case?
3. Is there any deficiency and negligence of service on the part of the opposite parties?
4. Is the Complainant entitled to the reliefs as claimed for? So far as the issue no.1 is concerned, it is
the clear finding of the Forum that the complainant is a consumer within the meaning of Section
2(1)(b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. So far as the issue no.2 is concerned, the District
Forum has held that it has the jurisdiction to try the case. So far as the issue nos. 3 and 4 are
concerned, the Forum held that the cheque in question was presented on 23rd September, 2009 but
the complainant did not get his payment. The Forum held that the objection filed by the opposite
parties were baseless as they stopped payment without any order from any Court of law and only on
the basis of the objection raised by a third party. Such payment could not have been stopped. It has
been held by the District Forum that the letter dated 22nd October, 2009 sent by SAMCO to the
opposite parties to release the amount to the complainant goes to prove that the opposite parties
purposely withheld the cheque without any reasonable basis. It has been held by the District Forum
that opposite parties, when got clearance from SAMCO, it was the duty to immediately release the
amount to the complainant. Therefore, according to the Forum, the opposite parties failed to
discharge the duty, the documents that is the sale deed and the partnership deed, which were relied
upon by the opposite parties did not help to prove their case. District Forum held that there was
gross deficiency and negligence in service on the part of the opposite parties. Accordingly, the said
Forum allowed the complaint case being C.C. Case No. 32/D/2009 on contest against opposite
parties. The opposite parties were directed to release the amount of Rs.7,00,000/- only, in favour of
the complainant together with interest @12% per annum w.e.f. 23rd September, 2009, till the date
of release of payment. The opposite parties were further directed to pay a compensation of
Rs.10,000/- only, together with cost of Rs.5,000/- only, for mental harassment and agony caused by
the opposite party. The order was directed to be complied with within 30 days from the date of
passing of the order or from the knowledge of the opposite parties, failing which, additional interest
@ 6% per annum was directed to be paid by the opposite parties on the total amount. The said
decision of the District Forum was challenged by the opposite parties before the Consumer Disputes
Redressal Commission, West Bengal, which was registered as S.C. Case No. FA/46/2010. The appeal
was taken up for hearing by the learned Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (hereinafter to
be called as the said Commission) and by a judgment and order dated 19th April, 2010, set aside the
order passed by the District Forum. While setting aside the judgment and order, passed by the
District Forum, the learned Appellate Commission held that the appellants before the Commission
were not liable for non-encashment of the cheque and that too for very tenable and valid reasons. It
has been held that the appellants very correctly and beautifully pointed out major discrepancies, as
were applicable under Co-operative Act and other dispensation and that no stretch of logic and
provisions, the appellants should be held to be efficient in service in such regard. The observation
that there was no deficiency in service on the part of the appellants cannot be taken note of by the
Appellate Commission inasmuch as, the said point has been rightly decided in favour of the
complainant and the contention raised by the appellants do not appear to be correct in view of the
provisions of law. This court cannot agree with the finding made by the learned Appellate
Commission that the appellants are not at all liable for payment of the said amount. A cheque has
been issued, the same was placed for clearance, this Court does not find any reason as to why the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126853918/ 9Unknown vs Branch Manager Of District ... on 22 August, 2016
payment was withheld at the objection of a third party. Furthermore, the learned Appellate Court
below has not discussed anything about the evidence dealt with by the District Forum. Simply by
saying that on the basis of the evidence, the appellant has improved his case will not do, the
Appellate Court must furnish its own reasons as to why it says that on the basis of the evidence, the
complainant has failed to prove his case or as to how the District Forum failed to appreciate the
evidence on record. Unless that exercise is made by the Appellate Commission, the finding made by
the Appellate Court appears to be perverse because without discussing the evidence on record and
without discussing the error committed by the District Forum, the Appellate Commission does not
seem to be justified to discard the finding of the District Forum. Therefore, the finding arrived at by
the Appellate Commission appears to be perverse and is not sustainable in law.
On perusal of the order passed by the District Forum as also the documents relied on by the
complainant, it does not appear to this court that the order passed by the District Forum warrants
interference in any manner. This court, therefore, set aside the order passed by the learned
Appellate Commission and affirm the order passed by the District Forum save and except that the
petitioner will not get the additional interest @ 6% per annum as has been mentioned by the District
Forum. This Court also modifies the order passed by the District Forum to the extent that the
petitioner will be entitled to get simple interest @ 9% per annum but not @ 12% per annum, as has
been held by the Apex Court in various decisions particularly in deciding the cases under Motor
Vehicles Act. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has held in the case of Surti Gupta vs. United India
Insurance Co. & Anr reported in 2015 SAR(C) 571 that the interest should be paid @ 9% per annum.
That being the position, this court directs that the petitioner will be entitled to interest @ 9% per
annum on the principal sum of Rs.7,00,000/- only, as directed by the District Forum.
The revisional application is disposed of.
