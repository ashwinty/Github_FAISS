JUDGMENT
Girish Chandra Gupta, J.
1. This is an application for confirmation of a scheme of amalgamation between the petitioner No. 1
and the petitioner No. 2. The assets and properties of the petitioner No. 1 including moveable,
immovable,rights and powers of every description together with liabilities are sought to be
transferred to the petitioner No. 2 in consideration of the petitioner No. 2, the transferee issuing to
the shareholders of the transferor company being the petitioner No. 1, one equity share of Rs. 10/-
each credited as fully paid up for every 15 fully paid up equity shares of Rs. 10/- each held by the
shareholders of the transferor company the petitioner No. 1.
2. A question cropped up as to whether Stamp Duty is payable in a case of transfer like this. By an
order dated 13-5-2002 the petitioners were directed to serve a copy of the petition upon the learned
Advocate General and the matter was adjourned till 20-5-2002. On 20-5-2002 both the petitioners
and the learned Advocate General made their respective submission. the matter was partly heard
State of West Bengal was added as a party to this application. A large number of applications for
sanction of scheme of reconstruction or amalgamation were subsequently tagged with this
application in order to facilitate the learned advocates appearing in other matters to appear and
make their submissions on the common question raised in these cases. Accordingly, various learned
advocates appearing in other matters also made their respective submissions against the issue
whereas learned Advocate General made his submission for the issue. The issue debated before this
Court is an follows:
Whether an order sanctioning a scheme of (SIC) or amalgamation under Section 394
read with Section 391 of The Companies Act, 1956 is liable to be stamped in
accordance with the provisions of Indian Stamp Act in its application to the State of
West Bengal.
3. An answer to this issue largely depends upon the answer to the question as to whether such an
order amounts to a convenance within the meaning of the provisions of Stamp Act if answer to this
question is in the affirmative and order under Section 394 of the Companies Act is liable to be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1990429/ 1Gemini Silk Limited vs Gemini Overseas Limited on 8 August, 2002
stamped.
4. The expression "conveyance" has been defined in Section 2 Sub-section (10) of the Indian Stamp
Act as follows:
(10) Conveyance--"Conveyance" includes a conveyance on sale and every instrument
by which property, whether movable or immovable is transferred inter vivos and
which is not otherwise specifically provided for by Schedule I or by Schedule IA as the
case may be.
5. There is a West Bengal Amendment by which an explanation has been added which provides as
follows:
Explanation -- An Instrument-
(i) whereby a co-owner of a property having defined share therein transfers such
share or part thereof to another co-owner of the (SIC) among co-owner or
(ii) whereby a partner transfer his share in the property of the partnership business
to another partner or to other partners whether separately or together with transfer
of other business assets or retirement or dissolution, or whereby he contributes to the
capital of the partnership firm by transferring his right and rule to or interest in any
property.
is for the purpose of this clause, an instrument by which property is transferred".
6. The explanation is not material for our purpose. We are concerned with the definition of the word
"conveyance". From the aforesaid definition what emerges is "conveyance includes.....every
instrument by which property whether movable or immovable, is transferred inter vivos and which
is not otherwise specifically provided for by Schedule I or by Schedule IA, as the case may be".
7. The expression "instrument" has been defined in Section 2 Sub-section (14) of the Indian Stamp
Act as follows:-
"(14) Instrument -- "Instrument" includes every document by which any right or
liability is, or purports to be, created, transferred, limited extended, extinguished or
recorded."
8. Let us new examine the effect of an order sanctioning a scheme for reconstruction and/or
amalgamation.
Sections 391(2) of the Companies Act, 1956 provides as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1990429/ 2Gemini Silk Limited vs Gemini Overseas Limited on 8 August, 2002
"391(2). If a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors,
or class of creditors, members, or class of members, as the case may be, present and
voting either in person or, where proxies are allowed under the rules made under
Section 643, by proxy, at the meeting agree to any compromise or arrangement, the
compromise or arrangement shall, if sanctioned by the Court be binding on all the
creditors, all the creditors of the class, all the members, or all the members of the
class as the case may be and also on the company or in the case of a company which is
being wound up, on the liquidator and contributories of the company:
Provided that no order sanctioning any compromise or arrangement shall be made by
the Court unless the Court is satisfied that the company or any other person by whom
an application has been made under Sub-section (1) had disclosed to the Court, by
affidavit or otherwise, all material facts relating to the company, such as the latest
financial position of the company, the latest auditor's report on the accounts of the
company the pendency of any investigation proceedings in relation to the company
under Sections 235 to 251 and the like.
9. Section 394 of the Companies Act, 1956 insofar as the same is material for our present purpose
provides as follows:-
"Provisions for facilitating reconstruction and amalgamation of companies.
394(1) Where an application is made to the Court under Section 391 for the
sanctioning of a compromise or arrangement proposed between a company and any
such persons as are mentioned in that section, and it is shown to the Court:-
?(a) that the compromise or arrangement has been proposed for the purposes of or in
connection with a scheme for the reconstruction of any company or companies, or
the amalgamation of any two or more companies; and
(b) that under the scheme the whole or any part of the undertaking property or
liabilities of any company concerned in the scheme (in this section referred to as a
"transferor company") is to be transferred to another company (in this section
referred to as "the transferee company"):
the Court may, either by the order sanctioning the compromise or arrangement or by
a subsequent order, make provision for all or any of the following matters:
(i) the transfer to the transferee company of the whole or any part of the undertaking,
property or liability of any transferor company;
(ii) the allotment or appropriation by the transferee company of any shares,
debenture, policies, or other like interests in that company which under the
compromise or arrangement are to be allotted or appropriated by that company to or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1990429/ 3Gemini Silk Limited vs Gemini Overseas Limited on 8 August, 2002
for any person;
(iii) the continuation by or against the transferor company of any legal proceedings
pending by or against any transferor company;
(iv) the dissolution without winding up, of any transferor company;
(v) (SIC)
(vi) (SIC) Provided .... (SIC) Provided further (SIC) (2) Where an order under this
section provides for the transfer or any property or liabilities, then by virtue of the
order, that property shall be transferred to and vest in and those liabilities shall be
transferred to and become the liabilities of the transferee company: and in the case of
any property if the order so direct freed from any charge which is by virtue of the
compromise or arrangement to cease.
(3) Within thirty days after the making of an order under this section every company
in relation to which the order is made shall cause a certified copy thereof to be filed
with the Registrar for registration.
If default..... .....
(4) ....."
10. It appears from Section 394(1) of the Companies Act that the properties and liabilities of the
Transferor Company stand transferred to the Transferee Company by virtue of an order of Curt. The
statutory form of an order under Section 394(2) of the Companies Act provides for three different
Schedules in order to incorporate therein the properties transferred. It would be useful to take
notice of the statutory form of an order under Section 394(2) of the Companies Act.
"The Companies (Court) Rules, 1959-Form 42 (See Rule 84) Upon the above petition
and application coming on for further hearing on.....upon reading etc. and upon
hearing etc. THIS COURT DOTH ORDER (1) That all the property, rights and powers
of the transferor company specified in the first, second and third parties of the
Schedule hereto and all other property, rights and powers of the transferor company
be transferred without further act or deed to the transferee company and accordingly
the same shall pursuant to Section 394(2) of the Companies Act, 1956 be transferred
to and vest in the transferee company for all the estate and interest of the transferor
company therein but subject nevertheless to all charges now affecting the same other
than (here set out any charges which by virtue of the compromise or arrangement are
to cease to have effect): and (2) That all the liabilities and duties of the transferor
company be transferred without further act or deed to the transferee company and
accordingly the same shall, pursuant to Section 394(2) of the Companies Act, 1956 be
transferred to and become the liabilities and duties of the transferee company; and

(3) That all proceedings now pending by or against the transferor company be
continued by or against the transferee company; and (4) That the transferee company
do without further application allot to such members of the transferor company as
have not given such notice of dissent as is regard by clause.....of the compromise or
arrangement herein the shares in the transferee company to which they are entitled
under the said compromise or arrangement; and (5) That the transferor company do
within 14 days after the date of this order cause a certified copy of this order to be
delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration and on such certified copy
being so delivered the transferor company shall be dissolved and the Registrar of
Companies shall place all documents relating to the transferor company, and
registered with him on the file kept by him in relation to the transferee company and
the files relating to the said two companies shall be consolidated accordingly; and (6)
That any person interested shall be at liberty to apply to the Court in the above
matter for any directions that may be necessary.
SCHEDULE PART I (Insert a short description of the freehold property of the transferor company)
PART II (Insert a short description of the leasehold property of the transferor company.) PART III
(Insert a short description of all stocks, shares, debentures and other charges in action of the
transferor company).
Dated this ...day of... 19 (By the Court) Registrar."
.....
11. It appears that the transfer of assets and liabilities takes effect by an order of Court. The order
also provides for passing of consideration from the transferee company to the shareholders of the
transferor company. The well-settled law is that the properties belong to the company and the
company belongs to the shareholders. Therefore, the owners of the company receive the
consideration. An additional reason why the owners of the company receive the consideration is that
by the same order provisions is also made for dissolution of the transferor company.
12. Is such a transfer a voluntary act of the parties? i.e. transferor company, the transferee company
and their respective shareholders?
13. In the case of General Radio and Appliances Co. Ltd. v. M.A. Khader a question arose as to
whether a transfer of assets and properties by virtue of an order of Court under Section 394 of the
Companies Act, 1956 is an involuntary transfer. Their Lordships answered this question in the
negative. It would be appropriate to notice the relevant portion of the said judgment:-
"...The only question which falls for consideration in this appeals is whether in view
of the order made by the High Court of Bombay on 27-2-1968 sanctioning the scheme
of amalgamation proposed by the appellant No. 1 company under Sections 391 and
394 of the Companies Act in Company Petition No. 4 of 1963 and the subsequent
transfer of tenancy right in the suit premises and vesting of the same in the 2nd
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1990429/ 5Gemini Silk Limited vs Gemini Overseas Limited on 8 August, 2002
appellant (SIC) be deemed to be subletting of the tenancy right of the appellant (SIC)
transfer or assignment of (SIC) No. 1 to the appellant No. 2 within the meaning of
Section 10(u)(a) of the said Act."
".....In the instant case the appellant No. 1 i.e. M/s. General radio and appliance Co.
(P) Ltd. is undoubtedly the tenant having taken lease of the premises in question
from the respondent landlord by executing a rent agreement dated 12-1-1959 at a
rental of Rs. 200/- per month the tenancy commencing from 7-1-1959. On the basis
of the sanction accorded by order of the High Court of Bombay made on 27-3-1968
sanctioning the scheme of amalgamation in Company Petition No. 4 of 1968 filed by
the 1st appellant, all the property, rights and powers of every description including all
leases and tenancy rights etc. of the 1st appellant were transferred to and vested or
deemed to be transferred and vested in 2nd appellant M/s. National Ekco Radio and
Engineering Co. Ltd. It also appears that the appellant No. 1 company stood dissolved
from 16-4-1968. This clearly goes to show that the General Radio and Appliances (P)
Ltd. the tenant company has transferred all its interest in the tented premises in
favour of the appellant No. 2 i.e. National Ekco Radio and Engineering Co. Ltd. (the
transferee company). The order of amalgamation has been made on the basis of the
petition made by the transferor company in Company Petition No. 4 of the 1968 by
the High Court of Bombay. As such it cannot be said that this is an involuntary
transfer effeced by order of the Court."
(emphasis supplied) The effect of an order under Section 153(A) of the Companies Act, 1912 which
corresponds to Sections 391 and 394 of the Companies Act, 1956 has been very accurately stated in
the case of (SIC) Subrahmanya Nadar, . Section 153(A) of the Companies Act has been enacted with
a view to facilitate arrangement and compromise between a Company and its creditors or
shareholders which involve a transfer of its assets and liabilities to other companies as part of such
arrangement. If any such scheme or arrangement is sanctioned by Court the Court is empowered by
the section to make provisions by its order sanctioning the arrangement or any subsequent order,
for the transfer of the assets and liabilities of a company in liquidation to another company styled in
the section as transferee company. Where an order of Court made under the section provides for the
transfer of the assets and liabilities of a company in liquidation to another company, the assets are,
by virtue of that order, without more transferred to and vest in the transferee company and the
liabilities of the former company are also cast upon the transferee company. Under the ordinary law
of contract while assets are assignable, liabilities under contracts or duties arising thereunder are
not assignable, but the effect of Section 153(A) is to some extent to override the ordinary law. Thus
by an order sanctioning amalgamation the rights interest and liabilities of the transferor company
are transferred and vested in the transferee company. It appears that by the order of amalgamation
the interest, rights of transferor company in all its properties including leasehold interest and
tenancy rights are transferred and vested in the transferee company."
14. The next question of some importance is "whether such a transfer is sale." In Wall v. London and
N. Assets Corporation, reported in L.R. (1892) 2 Sh. 464 Lindley, M.R. observed inter alia that "..... I
do not see how the company as a business transaction can practically amalgamate.....with companies
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1990429/ 6Gemini Silk Limited vs Gemini Overseas Limited on 8 August, 2002
carrying on business unless the company in some way or other sells its assets as a whole -- not for
money for that would be a simple sale - but for shares in the purchasing company."
15. The consideration for sale in a transaction like this is shares. In the case in hand we have already
noticed that the shareholders of the transferor company shall receive one fully paid up equity shares
of Rs. 10/- each of the transferee company in lieu of every 15 fully paid up shares held by them in the
transferor company. The share exchange ratio is decided on the basis of a large number of factors
including the values of the net assets of the two, transferor and the transferee companies. In order to
arrive at a figure of the net assets it is obvious that the liabilities have to bet set off against the gross
value of the assets. An Authoritative Treaty on this subject is Weinberg and Blank's Take Overs and
Mergers. The paragraphs 2052 to 2060 of the 4th Edition of the aforesaid Authoritative Treaty has
been summarised by the Apex Court in the case of Hindustan Leaver Employees Union v. Hindustan
Lever Ltd. reported in (1995) Supp. (1) SCC 499 in paragraph 41 of the aforesaid report which reads
as follows:-
"This problem of valuation in the case of amalgamation of two companies has been
dealt with by Weinberg and Blank in the book Take-overs and Mergers in which it has
been stated that some or all of the following factors will have to be taken into account
in determining the final share exchange ratio:
(1) The Stock Exchange prices of the shares of the two companies before the
commencement of negotiations or the announcement of the bid.
(2) The dividends presently paid on the shares of the two companies. It is often
difficult to induce a shareholder, particularly an institution, to agree to a merger or
share-for-share bid if it involves a reduction in his dividend income.
(3) The relating growth prospects of the two companies.
(4) The cover (ratio of after-tax earnings to dividends paid during the year) for the
present dividends of the two companies. The fact that the dividend of one company is
better covered than that of the other is factor which will have to be compensate for at
least to some extent.
(5) In the case of equity shares, the relating gearing of the shares of the two
companies. The gearing of an ordinary shares is the ratio of borrowings to the equity
capital.
(6) The values of the net assets of the two companies. Where the transaction is a
thorough going merger, this may be more of a talking-point than a matter of
substance, since what is relevant is the relative values of the two undertakings as
going concerns.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1990429/ 7Gemini Silk Limited vs Gemini Overseas Limited on 8 August, 2002
(7) The voting strength in the merger enterprise of the shareholders of the two
companies.
(8) The past history of the prices of the shares of the two companies."
16. In the case before Their Lordships Mr. Malagam the Valuer adopted a combination of three
well-accepted methods to arrive at the fair value of the shares. The methods were : (i) the yield
method; (ii) the asset value method; and (iii) the market value method. After considering all the
relevant factors, the valuer recommended an exchange ratio of 2 equity shares of HLL for every 15
ordinary shares of 'TOMCO'.
17. In that case the scheme had been approved by the Trial Court. The Division Bench dismissed the
appeal. The matter was taken up to the Apex Court. The Apex Court dismissed the Special Leave
Petition. In other words, the method of valuation adopted in that case was approved. One of the
methods taken into consideration was the asset valuation method.
18. The views expressed by Lindley M.R. in the case of Wall v. London (supra) that "the company in
some way or the other sells its assets as a whole" find support from Section 494 of the Companies
Act, 1956.
19. Section 494 of the Companies Act also makes provisions for statutory amalgamation when the
Company is in voluntary liquidation. Section 494 specifically provides for sale. Section 494 insofar
as the same is material for our purpose may be noticed hereinbelow:-
"Power of liquidator to accept shares, etc. as consideration for sale of property of
company. 494.(1) Where-
(a) a company (in this section called 'the transferor company') is proposed to be, or is
in course of being, wound up altogether voluntarily; and
(b) the whole or any part of its business or property is proposed to be transferred or
said to another company whether a company within the meaning of this Act or not (in
this section called the transferee company');
the liquidator of the transferor company may, with the sanction of a special resolution of that
company conferring on the liquidator either a general authority or an authority in respect of any
particular arrangement:--
(i) receive, by way of compensation or part compensation for the transfer or sale,
shares, policies, or other like interests in the transferee company for distribution
among the members of the transferor company, or
(ii) enter into any other arrangement whereby the members of the transferor
company (SIC) of receiving cash, shares policies or other like interests or in addition
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1990429/ 8Gemini Silk Limited vs Gemini Overseas Limited on 8 August, 2002
thereto, participate in the profits of or receive any other benefit from, the transferee
company.
(2) Any sale or arrangement in pursuance of this section shall be binding on the
members of the transferor company.
(3) .....
(4) .....
(5) .....
(6) ....."
(emphasis supplied) In this regard Section 507 may also be noticed hereinbelow:-
"Application of Section 494 to a creditors' voluntary winding up 507. The provisions
of Section 494 shall apply in the case of a creditors voluntary winding up with the
modification that the powers of the liquidator under that section shall not be (SIC)
except with the sanction either of the Court or of the committee of inspection."
20. A Division Bench of this Court in the case of Harakrishna Lohia v. Hoolungoore Tea Co. Ltd.
held "the provisions contained in Section 391 to 396 and 494 illustrate some instance of statutory
power of amalgamation a company with another company without any specific in the
Memorandum".
21. Sale of goods has been defined in Section 4(1) of the Sale of Goods Act as follows:
"4.(1) - A contract of sale of goods is a contract whereby the seller transfers or agrees
to transfer the property in goods to the buyer for a price. There may be a contract of
sale between one part-owner and another."
22. Section 2(10) of the Sale of Goods Act provides as follows:-
"2(10). - 'Price' means the money consideration for a sale of goods."
23. Sale under Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act is defined as follows:-
"54. 'Sale' defined.- 'Sale' is a transfer of ownership in exchange for a price paid or
promised or part-paid and part-promised."
24. Benjamin's Sale of Personal Property (2nd Edition 1873) Page 1 was quoted in the judgment of
the House of Lords reported in 1955(2) All.E.R. 345 as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1990429/ 9Gemini Silk Limited vs Gemini Overseas Limited on 8 August, 2002
"By the common law a sale of personal property was usually termed a 'bargain and
sale of goods'. It may be defined to be a transfer of the absolute or general property in
a thing for a price in money. Hence it follows that, to constitute a valid sale, there
must be a concurrence of the following elements, viz:- (1st) Parties competent to
contract; (2nd) Mutual assent; (3rd) A thing, the absolute or general property in
which is transferred from the seller to the buyer; and (4th) A price in money paid or
promised."
25. Security which is convertible in money may be the price contemplated hereinabove. I, therefore,
conclude that a transaction like this under Section 394 of the Companies Act has all the trappings of
a sale.
26. In the aforesaid background we have to find out answer to the question posed hereinabove. The
fact that in a transaction like this properties together with liabilities are transferred which have all
the trappings of a sale cannot be doubted. Such a sale or transfers effectuated by an order of Court
passed under Section 394(2) of the Companies Act, 1956. Then the question which follows "is an
order of Court sanctioning a scheme which effectuates the transfer a conveyance?" We have already
noticed that conveyance includes every instrument by which property whether moveable or
immovable is transferred inter vivos. A Company is a living person within the meaning of Section 5
of the Transfer of Property Act. The next pertinent question which follows "is such an order an
instrument?" The word 'instrument' has been defined in the Indian Stamp Act as follows:-
"(14) Instrument. - "Instrument" includes every document by which any right is, or
purports to be created, transferred, limited extended, extinguished or recorded."
27. It is also an inclusive definition like the definition of the word 'conveyance'. Therefore, it is not
an exhaustive definition. Reference in this regard can be made to the case of Krishi Utpadan Mandi
Samiti and Ors. v. Shankar Industries and Ors., reported in 1993 Supp. (3) SCC 361(II) wherein it
was held that "it is a well settled rule of interpretation that where the legislature uses the words
'means' and 'includes' such definition is to be given a wider meaning and is not exhaustive or
restricted to the items contained or includes in such definition. Thus the meaning of 'agricultural
produce' in the above definition is not restricted to any products of agriculture as specified in the
Schedule but also includes such items which come into being in processed form and further includes
such items which are called as gur, rab, shakkar, khandsari and jaggery".
28. A document creating or transferring a right is an instrument. Can it be said (SIC) effectuating
the transfer is a document? An answer in the affirmative was given by the Apex Court in the case of
Haji Sekh Suhan v. Madho Das, wherein Their Lordships held "the question is whether the word
'document' includes a decree of the Court. We do not see any good reason why a decree of the Court,
when it affects the proprietary rights and is in relation to them, should not be included in this
expression."
29. In the case before the Apex Court the intermediary sought to evict the person in possession on
the basis of a decree of Court declaring his title whereas prior to passing of the decree M.P. Abolition
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1990429/ 10Gemini Silk Limited vs Gemini Overseas Limited on 8 August, 2002
of Proprietary Rights (estates, mahals, alienated land) Act, 1950 came into force: Sub-section (1) of
Section 4 of the aforesaid Act provided as follows:-
"When the notification under Section 3 in respect of any area has been published in
the Gazette then notwithstanding anything contained in any contract, grant or
document or in any other law for the time being in force save as otherwise provided
in this Act, the consequences as hereinafter set forth shall from the beginning of the
date specified in such notification be hereinafter referred to as the date of vesting),
ensue, namely all rights title and interest vesting in the proprietor in such area
including land cultivable or barren (SIC) shall cease and be vested in the state for
purposes of the state free of all encumbrances.
30. The question more pointedly cropped up before the Apex Court in the case of Ruby Sales and
Services v. State of Mahrashtra . In that case in a suit for specific performance the property was
conveyed to the vendee by a consent decree. The question arose whether the consent decree is in
instrument and liable to be stamped. The consent decree contained a recital to the effect that "this
decree does operate as the conveyance from defendants in favour of the plaintiffs in respect of the
said property more particularly described in exhibit A to the plaint". Their Lordships held that
"there is no particular pleasure in merely going by the label but what is decisive is by the terms of
the document. It is clear from the terms of the consent decree that it is also an 'instrument' under
which title has been passed over to the appellants/plaintiffs. It is a live document transferring the
property in dispute from the defendants to the plaintiffs".
31. The aforesaid decree was based on an agreement between the parties. So is the case with an
order under Section 394 of the Companies Act which is also based on an agreement between the
transferor and the transferee. In this regard reference may be made to the case of (SIC) Mills Co.
Ltd. v. Rivers Steam Navigation Co. and Ors., reported in (SIC) at page 76 wherein a learned Single
Judge of this Court opined that "it should be remembered that a vesting order as is contemplated by
Sections 153 and 153A of the Indian Companies Act is made in order to facilitate the amalgamation
or in other words. in aid of amalgamation or the scheme of arrangement; but the actual transfer is
effected by the act of parties, that is, by the transferor company to the transferee company. The
court merely accords its sanction to the arrangement entered into between the transferor company
and the transferee company."
32. Reference may also be made to the case of Sharat Hardwre Industries P. Ltd. reported in 48
Company Cases 23 at page 27 wherein it was held that "in essence, a scheme is a contract between
two or more parties. It requires the necessary approval in accordance with section 391 of the Act, if it
is a scheme covered by that provision, otherwise any other contract entered into by a company dos
not require such approval. The essential features of the present scheme under consideration are that
two companies are merging with each other. Therefore, it is a contract between the companies. Such
a contract does not require the approval of the court. But as one of these companies will merge into
the other and will thereafter have to be dissolved under Section 394 of the Companies Act, 1956
considered from the point of view of that company which is to cease to exist, the scheme or
arrangement between the two companies is also a scheme or arrangement between the transferor
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1990429/ 11Gemini Silk Limited vs Gemini Overseas Limited on 8 August, 2002
company and its shareholders and creditors etc. That is why the scheme requires to be placed for
consideration in the manner required by Section 391. It also requires the sanction of the Court Seen
from the point of view of the transferee company, the agreement is essentially a contract which does
not affect the creditors or members of the transferee company in any manner. Therefore, the scheme
does not require to be sanctioned from the point of view of the transferee company under Section
391 of the Act. However, if the scheme had some flaws whereby the rights of the transferee company
were affected, it would require the approval of these persons at a meeting or meetings held in
accordance with Section 391 and would also require the sanction of the court having jurisdiction
which in this case would be the Calcutta High Court. In the analysis. I have considered also one
possible case which might arise which is, let us assume that the scheme is approved by the members
of the transferor company but, later, the transferee company refuses to give effect to the scheme.
That is the position also analysed in the case of Union Services Private Ltd. [1973] 43 Comp. Cases
319 (Mad) referred to earlier and decided by the Madras High Court. Obviously, if the transferee
company refuses to give effect in the scheme the purpose and object of the scheme would be
demolished..... In fact, without the approval of the transferee company, the scheme could not have
been passed by the members of the petitioner company. Secondly, the scheme could not have been
put forward as a proposal unless there was an arrangement between the petitioner company and
M/s. Choudhary Metal Industries (P) Ltd." (the transferee). Reference may also be made to Palmer's
Company Law, 25th Edition Vol. 2 at page 12014 where the learned author opined as follows:-
"A compromise approved by a great majority of creditors might be rendered
ineffective if a comparatively small creditor were to object and to stand out against it.
It is one of the purposes of Section 425 to meet this situation.
The effect of scheme under this section is: to supply by recourse to the procedure
thereby prescribed the absence of that individual agreement by every member of the
class to be bound by the scheme which would otherwise be necessary to give it
validity."
33. The case referred to by the learned author is in (SIC) Guardian Assurance Company (1917) 1 Ch.
431, 441. The aforesaid commentary of the learned author was quoted with approval by the Apex
Court in the case of J.K. Bombay Private Ltd. v. New Kaiser(sic) Hind Spinning and Weaving Co.
Ltd. thereof.
34. In the case of Li Taka Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. The State of Maharashtra, the question pointed
arose whether an order under Section 394 of the Companies Act is an instrument and therefore
liable to be stamped. This case is however distinguishable because the State of Mahrashtra has made
an amendment to the Stamp Act by which an order passed under Section 394 is specifically brought
within the meaning of the word 'conveyance'. We shall deal with that aspect of the matter hereafter
when the respective submissions made by the learned advocates will be noticed. At this stage what is
to be notice is the finding of the Division Bench that an order under Section 394 of the Companies
Act is based on agreement between the transferor and the transferee. The Division Bench opined as
follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1990429/ 12Gemini Silk Limited vs Gemini Overseas Limited on 8 August, 2002
"As such the amalgamation order passed under Section 394 of the Companies Act is
based upon the agreement between the two companies. In amalgamation two or
more companies are merged into one or one taking over the other. The proceedings
under Section 394 of the Companies Act would commence because of the agreement
entered into by two companies. The amalgamation scheme which is an agreement
between the companies, is presented before the Court and the Court passes
appropriate order sanctioning the compromise or arrangement. But the foundations
or basis for passing an order of amalgamation is the agreement between the two or
more companies. Section 394 of the Companies Act makes this abundantly clear. It
reads as under:
(SIC) an application is made to the Court under Section 391 for the sanctioning of a
compromise or arrangement proposed between a company and any such persons as
are mentioned in that section, and it is shown to the Court-
(a) that the compromise or arrangement has been proposed for the purposes of or in
connection with a scheme for the reconstruction of any company or companies, or
the amalgamation of any two or more companies: and
(b) that under the scheme the whole or any part of the undertaking, property or
liabilities of any company concerned in the scheme (in this section referred to as a
"transferor company") is to be transferred to another company (in this section
referred to as "the transferred company") the court may, either by the order
sanctioning the compromise or arrangement or by a subsequent order, make
provision for all or any of the following matters:
(i) the transfer to the transferee company of the whole or any part of the undertaking.
Property or liability of any transferor company:
(ii) the allotment or appropriations by the transferee company of any shares,
debentures, policies or other like interests in that company which, under the
compromise or arrangement are to be allotted or appropriated by the company to or
for any person;
iii) the continuation by or against the transferee company of any legal proceedings
pending by or against any transferor company.
(iv) the dissolution, without winding up of any transferor company.
(v) the provision to be made for any persons who, within such time and in such
manner as the Court directs, dissent from the compromise or arrangement: and
(vi) such incidental, consequential and supplemental matters as are necessary to
secure that the reconstruction or amalgamation shall be fully and effectively carried
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1990429/ 13Gemini Silk Limited vs Gemini Overseas Limited on 8 August, 2002
out:
Provided that no compromise or arrangement proposed for the purposes of, or in
connection with, a scheme for the amalgamation of a company, which is being wound
up, with any other company or companies, shall be sanctioned by the Court unless
the Court has received a report from the Company Law Board or the Registrar that
the affairs of the Company have not been conducted in a manner prejudicial to the
interests of its members or to public interest:
Provided further that no order for the dissolution of any transferor company under
Clause (iv) shall be made by the Court unless the Official Liquidator or scrutiny of the
books and papers of the company, made a report to the Court that the affairs of the
company have not been conducted in a manner prejudicial to the interests of its
members or to public interest.
(2) Where an order under this section provides for the transfer of any property or
liabilities, then, by virtue of the order, that property shall be transferred and vest in
and those liabilities shall be transferred to and become the liabilities of the transferee
company, and in the case property if the order so directs free from any charge which
is by virtue of the compromise or arrangement to cease to have effect (Emphesis
supplied)
35. From the aforesaid survey of the statutory provisions and the decided cases law appears to be
that an order sanctioning a scheme of reconstruction or amalgamation has its genesis in an
agreement between the shareholders of the transferor and the transferee company; the intended
transfer is a voluntary act of the contracting parties the transfer has all the trappings of a sale: the
transfer is effected by an order of Court and that the order of court is an instrument by which the
transfer is effected. Once the order is held to be an instrument the irresistible conclusion is that it is
a conveyance. Let us now consider the submission to commendably advanced by the learned
advocates against the issue.
36. Mr. S.N. Mukherjee, learned advocate after conclusion of his submissions submitted a brief note
of has submissions. I shall set out his written note itself lest(SIC) omit any of his points. His first
submission is as follows:
"Companies (Court) Rules 1959 (SIC) Form 42 have statutory force force (SIC). The
companies Act 1956 came into force after the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. The
Companies Act is a later enactment and in the event of any inconsistency, the latter
will prevail. An order-sanctioning scheme of compromise or amalgamation can
provide for transfer of assets without any further act or deed. As such no stamp is
liable to be paid on such order.
37. This submission of Mr. Mukherjee cannot be accepted because:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1990429/ 14Gemini Silk Limited vs Gemini Overseas Limited on 8 August, 2002
(a) Section 394 of the Companies Act does not provide that an order sanctioning a
scheme is not liable to be stamped.
(b) The provision for transfer of assets without any further act or deed does not mean
more than that a formal document is not necessary in order to effectuate the transfer.
(c) But that does not mean that if the order sanctioning scheme itself is an
instrument the same will not attract Stamp Duty.
38. His second submission is as follows:
"An order sanctioning a scheme is not a conveyance within the meaning of Section
2(10) of the Indian Stamp Act. Such an order is not a sale and thus, cannot be
construed to be a conveyance on sale. Further an order under Section (SIC) of the
Companies Act is not an Instrument by which property is (SIC) vivos. This is so for
following reasons:-
i) A Court order is not an instrument (7 Equity Cases Act, ILR 1887 11 Bombay, 506
at 512).
(ii) An order under Section 394 of the Companies Act not an instrument of transfer
18 Comp. Cases).
(iii) In the event it is held that an order under Section 394 is an instrument even then
it will not be a conveyance within the meaning of Section 2(10) of the Stamp Act as:-
(a) Section 2(10) of the Stamp Act only covers instrument by which property alone is
transferred. It does not deal with instruments by which liabilities are transferred.
(b) There is no transfer inter vivos where the order under Section 394 of the Act
provides for dissolution of the transferor company as well as vesting of its properties
upon the transferor company."
39. This submission is not acceptable for the following reasons:
(a) For reasons discussed hereinabove I am inclined to hold that the transaction has
all the trappings of a sale.
(b) Definition of the word 'instrument' includes every document by which any right or
liability is created or transferred. A decree has been construed by the Apex Court to
be a document (See Haji v. Madho [supra]). A decree effectuating a transfer of title
has been held by the Apex Court to be an instrument. (See Ruby Sales v. State of
Maharashtra [supra]).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1990429/ 15Gemini Silk Limited vs Gemini Overseas Limited on 8 August, 2002
(c) 7 Equity Cases 461 does not apply because that was a case decided under the
provisions of Apportionment Act. The provisions of the said act are not available in
the report. Therefore, this judgment does not advance the submission of Mr.
Mukherjee
(d) ILR 1887 (11) Bombay 506 does not apply because what was held in that case was
that an unregistered decree is admissible in evidence. Registration and stamp are two
different things governed by two different acts. Therefore, this judgment is of no
assistance.
(e) 18 Company Cases 1 is only an authority for the proposition that a transfer of
decree under Section 153 and 153A of the Companies Act, 1913 takes place by virtue
of an order of court and is not by way an assignment. I shall have occasion to deal
with thus aspect of the matter is greater detail when I shall deal with the submissions
of Mr. Dev
(f) I am unable to accept that Section 2(10) of the Indian Stamp Act does not apply
where properties are transferred along with liabilities. Such a case in my view, would
be clearly covered by Section 24 of the Indian Stamp Act. The object of Section 24 has
been very succinctly laid down in the case of Somaiya Organics v. Board of Revenue
wherein Their Lordships stated the object of the section as follows:
"The object of Section 24 of the Act is very clear. That section means that when a
purchaser purchases a property for a certain amount subject to the payment of
another debt, actual or contingent, he is virtually purchasing the property for the said
amount plus the amount of the debt and the aggregate of the two amounts ought to
be treated as the true amount for which the property is being sold. Otherwise there is
bound to be a difference between the true consideration and the consideration which
is made liable to stamp duty. To illustrate, take the present case itself. The properties
which had been treated as sufficient security by the Bank for the liability of Rs.
65,00,000/- must be ordinarily much more valuable than Rs. 65,00,000/- but on the
date of conveyance stamp duty would have become payable only on Rs. 7,76,000/-
but for the above rule in Section 24 of the Act. In this case the amount of Rs.
7,76,000/- must have been fixed by the parties taking into consideration the liability
to the bank under the mortgage which might arise in future."
(g) It is true that an order for dissolution of the transferrer company can be passed simultaneously
wit the sanction of the scheme provided the transferor company has got a cleanchit from the
Company Law Board or the Registrar or the Official Liquidator as the case may be. But that does not
mean that the company stands dissolved prior to completion of the transfer. In that case, the
transfer will never be completed. The transferor company gets dissolved upon the certified copy of
the order dissolving the company being delivered to the Registrar of Companies as would appear fro
Form No. 42 extracted hereinabove whereas the scheme of amalgamation relates back to the date
when the scheme was agreed upon between the parties. Reference in this regard can be made to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1990429/ 16Gemini Silk Limited vs Gemini Overseas Limited on 8 August, 2002
case of Raghubar Dayal v. Bank of Upper India, reported in 46 LA. 135 wherein Their Lordships of
the Privy Council held as follows:-
"When under Section 153 of the Indian Companies Act 1913 compromise or
arrangement between a company and its creditors has been agreed by a three-fourths
majority and has been sanctioned by the Court, it is binding upon all the creditors
from the date at which it was agreed."
40. The reason is that Section 191(2) provides "the compromise or arrangement shall if sanctioned
by the Court be binding on all the creditors..... or all the members". (See in this regard 1916 (32)
Indian Cases 451 at page 453 where it was held that the words would have been "when it has been
sanctioned by the Court" instead of "if sanctioned by the Court" if the intention of the Legislature
were that the agreement would become binding from the date of sanction.)
41. The third submission of Mr. Mukherjee is as follows:
" deals with a case of consent decree where the terms of settlement was admittedly a
conveyance, transferring property alone. The amendment to the Bombay Stamp Act
of 10-12-1985 was considered irrelevant. The observation in the Supreme Court
judgment regarding the 1985 amendment to the Bombay Stamp Act is obviously not
its ratio . Decision in so far as in purports to hold that the amendment to the Bombay
Stamp Act incorporating an order under Section 394 within the definition of
conveyance in Section 2(g) of the Bombay Stamp Act was clarificatory amounts to a
misinterpretation of the Supreme Court judgment. The issue before the Supreme
Court was act whether the concerned amendments to the Bombay Stamp Act were
clarificatory. Further the Bombay High Court equates an order under Section 394 of
the Companies Act to a consent order, which is contrary to Supreme Court decision
regarding orders under Section 394 of the said Act (40 C.C. 68) at (SIC) ."
42. The aforesaid submission of Mr. Mukherjee cannot be accepted for the following reasons
(a) In the case of Ruby Sales the Apex Court held that the consent decree was an instrument it was
not held to be an instrument because it was a consent decree. It was held to be an instrument
because it conveyed the title in the property in dispute from the defendant to the plaintiff. Therefore
it is obvious that it was held to be an instrument because it had the effect of conveying the title and
not because it was a consent decree (SIC) this distinction is realised it would be clear that consent or
no consent when a decree or order of Court purports to transfer title, it becomes an instrument.
(b) I am unable to accept that the observation of the Apex Court in the case of Ruby Sales "it appears
to us that the amendment was made out of abundant caution and it does not mean that the consent
decree was not otherwise covered is not the ratio of the said judgment. From paragraph 14 of the
said judgment it would appear that it was submitted before the Apex Court "that prior to
amendment the consent decree was not included in the definition of conveyance and instrument". It
is this specific question which was answered by Their Lordships by the aforesaid observation.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1990429/ 17Gemini Silk Limited vs Gemini Overseas Limited on 8 August, 2002
(c) At this juncture it would be useful to notice the original definition of the word 'conveyance' as
appearing in the Maharashtra Act and the amendments made thereto.
Unamended provision Amended provision
'Conveyance includes a conveyance 'Conveyance includes:
on sale and every instrument by which property (i) a conveyance on sale,
whether moveable or immovable, is transferred (ii) every instrument.
inter vivos and which is not otherwise (iii) every decree or final order of
specifically provided for by Scheduled. any Civil Court.
specifically
(iv) every order made by the High
Court under Section 394 of the Companies
Act, in respect of amalgamation of
companies, by which property,
whether moveable or immoveable, or
any (SIC) or interest
in any property transferred to or vested in.
any person, inter vivos, and which is not
otherwise specifically provided for
by Schedule I.
Clause III was brought in by way of amendment on 10-12-1984 and Clause IV was brought in by way
of amendment on 1-4-1993. Clause IV was not there before the Apex Court in the case of Ruby Sales.
(d) I am unable to accept that the decision holding that by Act No. 17 of 1993 the Legislature has also
added Section 2(g)(iv) of the Companies Act in respect of amalgamation of companies. In our view
applying the ratio of the decision in the case of Ruby Sales Service prima facie it appears to be
clarificatory proceeds on the basis of misinterpretation of the judgment of the Apex Court in the case
of Ruby Sales Act order sanctioning a scheme under Section 394 does effect conveyance of title and
therefore such a conveyance was all along covered by the original definition of the word conveyance.
That is why the Division Bench held that the amendment to the definition of the word 'conveyance'
was clarificatory.
(e) I have already discussed hereinabove that an order passed under Section 394 is based on
agreement of the transferred and the transferee. Therefore, I am unable to accept that equation of
an order under Section 394 with a consent order is misplaced. Therefore, reference in cannot after
the situation.
43. The fourth submission of Mr. Mukherjee was as follows:
"A scheme of amalgamation or demerger is not a transfer for the purposes of the
Income Tax Act. (See Sections 2(194AA), 47, 72A and Chapter XXCI. An order
sanctioning a scheme is not a consent order. It binds dissenting parties and can
operate as res judicate. In effect an order sanctioning such scheme is a dissolution of
the transferor company. (In the case of amalgamation) and a dissolution of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1990429/ 18Gemini Silk Limited vs Gemini Overseas Limited on 8 August, 2002
concerned unit of a transferor company (in case of demerger) and distribution in
specie to the shareholders of the transferor company by allotment of shares in the
transferee company. There is no sale or exchange involved in amalgamation or
demeger. Transfer of properties and liabilities takes place by operation of law. No
provision has been made in the Schedule to the Stamp Act to include such an order as
an instrument liable to stamp duty. Only a Court order with regard to partition is
included in the Schedule to be subject to stamp duty. In such circumstances, it cannot
be said that court order under Section 394 is liable to stamp duty. (, , AIR 1935 Bom.
256, AIR (SIC) Comp Law Journal )."
44. I am unable to accept the aforesaid submissions for the following:
(a) We are not concerned here with the provisions of Income Tax Act.
(b) An order sanctioning a scheme of amalgamation is based on agreement between
the parties to the scheme.
(c) Dissolution of the transferor company is not the object of amalgamation. The
object is to transfer the assets and liabilities in lieu of shares. As a result of the
transaction the assets, liabilities including the shareholders disappear. What is left is
the corporate shall. The corporate shall is extinguished by the order of dissolution.
Therefore, the order of dissolution cannot be the object. It is a consequence.
(d) I have already held that the transaction has all the trappings of a sale.
(e) Moreover, ratio of share exchange is decided inter alia on the basis of the
networth of the assets of the transferor and the transferee companies.
(f) None of the cases referred to hereinabove is an authority for the proposition that
an order sanctioning a scheme is not liable to stamp duty.
45. The fifth submission of Mr. Mukherjee is as follows:-
"(SIC) passed under Section 394 of the Act is an appealable order and also operates
as res judicata. However, a consent order is not appealable and also does not operate
as res judicata. A consent order is a mere agreement between the parties. ."
46. I am unable to accept this submission because I have already held that the judgment of the Apex
Court in the case of Ruby Sales has to be understood in its proper prospective Consent or no consent
an order would become an instrument if it purports to effectuate transfer to title.
47. The sixth submission of Mr. Mukherjee contained in his note is as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1990429/ 19Gemini Silk Limited vs Gemini Overseas Limited on 8 August, 2002
Being a fiscal statute the Stamp Act is to be construed strictly. Schedule makes no
provision for stamping of orders under Section (SIC) of the Act (SIC) that the word
conveyance as defined in the Stamp Act (SIC) as order under Section 394 will put two
(SIC) persons at par and thus mere (SIC) unjustify which ought not to be permitted ,
). States which have required stamp act to be paid on order under Section 394 of the
Act have provided for the same expressed (SIC) that such an enactment was
necessary as there (SIC) to providing for payment of stamp duty on orders (SIC) so
the Court is not to fill the lacunae as that of (SIC)
48. No submissions were advanced as to how two dissimilarly situated period would be placed at par
or how would it operate unjustly in the event it is held that an order under Section 394 is covered by
the definition of the word 'conveyance'. I am unable to follow the logic of this submission. The cases
are in respect of a trial concerning murder. The relevance of these two judgments is not appreciated
by me. The case in my view militates against the contention of Mr. Mukherjee. This was a case in
which the Apex Court upheld the decision of the High Court striking down the taxation upon a
member of the Scheduled Tribe, who enjoyed general exemption from tax, solely on the ground that
he was a Government servant Members of the Tribe earning more in different walks of life were
exempted from the liability to pay income tax whereas the writ petitioner was based on the ground
that he was a government servant. The Apex Court held that for a valid classification what is
required is not some imaginary difference but a reasonable and substantial distinction having
regard to the purpose of law. In the present case, I fail to find any real difference between a transfer
under Section 394 and 494 of the Act. Then again there is no real difference between a transfer
under Section 394 and 494 of the Act so the one hand and a transfer under Section 291 of the Act. If
duty is payable in the case of a transfer under Section 293 of the Act, there is no valid reason why it
should not be payable in the case of a transfer under Section 394 of the Act.
49. Simply because the Gujarat Legislature thought in its wisdom to call the absence of clarification
in the definition of the word 'conveyance' a lacuna, for the purpose of bringing an amendment, it
cannot justifiably be contended that there is a lacuna in the Stamp Act or that until the so called
lucan has been filled up by the State Legislature an order sanctioning a scheme should not be held to
be covered by the definition of the words 'conveyance' and 'investment'. Interpretation of statute is
decisively in the domain of judiciary and not in the domain of legislature.
50. The seventh submission of Mr. Mukherjee appearing in the note is as follows:
"Section 24 of the Stamp Act does not apply for the following reasons:
(i) Consideration for a Scheme is not the take over of liabilities of the (SIC)
companies by the transferee companies.
(ii) Section 24 applies when transfer is made in consideration of liquidation or an
outstanding debt owed by the transferor to the transferee which is not the case in
case of amalgamation of demerger.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1990429/ 20Gemini Silk Limited vs Gemini Overseas Limited on 8 August, 2002
(iii) Even incase of mortgages as inferred (SIC) order made Section 394 is not a sale.
(iv) Section 24 of the Stamp Act applies to voluntary transfers."
51. I am not impressed by this argument for the following reasons:-
(a) This point has already been answered hereinabove and I need not reiterate the
reasons. Suffice it say that in consideration of the transfer the shareholders of the
transferor company are allotted shares in the transferee company. The ratio of the
share exchange is decided inter alia on the basis of networth of the assets of the
concerned companies. I am unable to accept that the taking over of the liability of the
transferor company is not a part of the consideration. I have already held that a
transfer of this nature has all the trappings of a sale.
(b) Section 24 of the Indian Stamp Act is not restricted in its operation to a
transaction of sale between the mortgagor and mortgagee.
(c) Transfer under Section 394 is also a voluntary transfer. See in this regard
discussed hereinabove.
52. The eighth submission of Mr. Mukherjee is as follows:-
"The English Case cited have no application as Section 54 of the English Stamp Act
specifically includes an order of court within the definition of conveyance. Further
the decision reported in (1891) - 41 All England Report 1094 was a case where the Act
of Parliament itself provided for payment of stamp duty."
53. This submission is correct.
54. I have therefore refrained from making reference to any of the English decisions.
55. The ninth submission of Mr. Mukherjee is as follows:-
"The two decisions cited on behalf of the State is AIR 1997 SC 1096 and have no
application to the facts of the case for the following reasons.
i) The instant case is not concerned with any contact in the provisions contained in
the same statute as was the case in the Supreme Court decision.
ii) None of the cases deal with the interpretation of the Indian Stamp Act or any fiscal
statute."
56. I have not taken into consideration any of the said two judgments for the purpose of deciding the
issue.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1990429/ 21Gemini Silk Limited vs Gemini Overseas Limited on 8 August, 2002
57. The tenth and last submission of Mr. Mukherjee as in the notes is as follows:-
"Without specific provision for an order of Court under Section 394 of the Companies
Act, 1956 being made liable to stamp duty. Such orders should not be made liable to
stamp duty. Without such provisions the matter would be unworkable particularly
where properties of the transferor companies are situate outside the State. The Stamp
Act being a complete Code what is not provided for is excluded. (AIR 1948 Pat. 430
paragraphs 20 to 22 pp. 433, 434, paragraphs 32 and 33. p. 434)."
(a) This Court is called upon to decide whether or not an order sanctioning a scheme is liable to
stamp duty on the basis of the provisions of the Stamp Act as it is. This Court is not called upon to
decide as to how the same will become operational or whether there will be any difficulty in applying
the provision. If any such difficulty is faced, the same would be taken care of by the Legislature.
(b) AIR 1948 Patna 430 is a judgment concerning Arbitration Act, 1940. Relevance of this judgment
was not indicated at the hearing nor does this judgment appear to have any bearing to the question
in hand.
58. The aforesaid notification shall apply to an order sanctioning a scheme for reconstruction or
amalgamation under Section 394 read with Section 391 of the Companies Act.
59. Mr. Sudipta Sarkar, learned senior advocate adopted the submissions made by Mukherjee. Mr.
Ranjan Dev learned senior advocate made his submission and subsequently submitted a brief note
of his submissions. The points urged by him as appearing from the said note are as follows:
"1. Section 9 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 provides that a transfer of property
may be made without writing in every case in which a writing is not expressly
required by law.
2. By virtue of Section 2(d) of the Transfer of Properties Act, transfers by "Operation
of Law" are not affected by the Transfer of Properties Act, except as provided in
Section 57 and Chapter IV of the Transfer of Property Act.
3. (SIC) Section 5 of the Transfer of Property Act preserves laws relating to transfer of
properties to or by companies.
58. Mr. Mukherjee may have inadvertently omitted to refer in his note to a
notification dated 16-1-1937 to which attention of the Court was drawn by him
Pursuant to his request the learned Advocate General was requested to ascertain
from the department whether the aforesaid notification continues to be in existence
to which his reply was in the affirmative. The said notification provides as follows:-
"Central Board of Revenue, Notification No. 1 dated the 16th January, 1937, which is
in the following terms:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1990429/ 22Gemini Silk Limited vs Gemini Overseas Limited on 8 August, 2002
"To remit the stamp duty chargeable under Article 23 and 62 of Schedule 1 to the said
Act on instruments evidencing transfer of property between companies limited by
shares as defined in the Indian Companies Act, 1913 in cases -
(i) Where at least 90 per cent of the issued share capital of the transferee company is
in the beneficial ownership of the transferor company, or
(ii) Where the transfer takes place between a parent company and a subsidiary
company one of which is the beneficial owner of not less than 90 per cent of the
issued share capital of the order, or
(iii) Where the transfer takes place between two subsidiary companies in each of
which not less than 90 per cent of the share capital is in the beneficial ownership of a
common parent company:
Provided that in each case a certificate is obtained by the parties from the officers
appointed in this behalf by the Local Government concerned that the conditions
above prescribed are fulfilled."
4. An order of Court passed under Section 394 of the Companies Act, 1956 itself
transfers the property of the transferor company to the transferee company. This
transfer is therefore by "Operation of Law".
5. A proposed scheme of amalgamation under Section 394 of the Companies Act,
1956 is not an 'instrument' or 'conveyance' attracting stamp duty. A proposed scheme
of amalgamation does not by itself transfer anything or create, limit, extend,
extinguish or record any right.
6. An order of Court passed under Section 394 is also not an 'instrument' or a
'conveyance'. It becomes operative as soon as it is pronounced even though not
written or signed. , .
7. Section 17 of the Stamp Act stipulates as to when instruments are to be stamped.
An oral is incapable of stamping."
60. The first submission of Mr. Deb is in aid of his sixth and seventh submission noted above, the
sum and substance of which is that there can be an oral transfer, an order sanctioning a scheme
becomes effective as soon as it is pronounced; it is as it were a transfer effected orally and an oral
transfer cannot be stamped because in order to become stampable there should be in existence an
instrument which can be stamped before or at the time of execution.
61. This submission in my view totally overlooks the provisions contained in Section 391(3) of the
Companies Act which provides that "an order made by the Court under Sub-section (2) shall have no
effect until a certified copy of the order has been filed with the Registrar". Therefore, the transfer

does not become effective until filing of the copy with the Registrar. It is well-settled that an order or
decree, required to be stamped under the Stamp Act, in order to be operative must be engrossed on
paper as required by that Act, and until the Judge signs the order or decree so engrossed a certified
copy cannot be issued. Not only that the copy cannot be issued but also the proceedings are not
terminated until the judge has signed the engrossed order. If any authority is needed for this view of
mine reference may be made to Jatindra v. Bejoy, reported in ILR 32 Cal. 483. This submission is
made out of desperation. His third submission is that under Section 5 of the Transfer of Property
Act the provisions thereof do not affect any law for the time being in force relating to transfer of
property to or by companies. If that it so, how can he seek to take advantage of Section 9 of the
Transfer of Property Act in order to avoid payment of Stamp duty. However, I have already
indicated that the submission otherwise is devoid of any merit. I need not reiterate that an orders
sanctioning a scheme has already been held by me to be an instrument. Thus, the 1st, 3rd, 6th and
7th submissions of Mr. Deb are disposed of.
62. His (SIC) noted above is that it is a transfer by operation of law. Let us (SIC) What is a transfer
by operation of law? The preamble of the Transfer of Property Act states that it is an Act "to define
and amend certain parts of the law relating to the transfer of property by act of parties....."
Therefore, in order to be a transfer by operation of law it has to be an involuntary act. Reference in
this regard can be made to a judgment of the House of Lords in the case Kirkness v. John (SIC)
reported in 1955 (2) All. E.R. 345. In that case the Wagons of the Coal merchants were (SIC) by the
Minister of Transport and the property in the wagons vested in the (SIC) Transport Commission.
Subsequently compensation was paid. Question arose whether it was a sale. The question was
answered in the negative because the transaction took place without any act of assent by either
party. Let us quote the relevant portion ".....the word sold is quite inappropriate to describe the
transfer or ownership of the wagons in question from the tax (SIC) to the Transport Commission,
which occurred automatically by process of law when they vested in the Commission under Section
29 of the Transport Act, 1947 without any act of assent by either party. The payment of
compensation on the scale provided in the Act cannot be regarded as a sufficient substitute for the
(SIC) element which (SIC)
63. The Apex Court in the case of General Radio v. M.A. Khader (supra) held that a transfer
pursuant to an order under Section 394 of the Companies Act is not involuntary in nature. In the
case of Indian Steel and Wire Products Ltd. v. State of Tamil Nadu, it was held "so long as mutual
assent is not completely excluded in any dealing in law it is a contract". I have demonstrated above
that the entire edifice culminating in an order under Section 394 of the Companies Act is based on
agreement. Therefore, the submission of Mr. Deb cannot be accepted.
64. The second submission of Mr. Deb does not in any way affect the answer to the question posed
before us.
65. The fifth submission of Mr. Deb is correct. I can only add that a scheme is the stepping stone for
an ultimate order under Section 394 of the Companies Act.

66. Mr. Ratnanka Banerjee learned advocate submitted that the transfer in such a case is not of the
rights alone but is also a transfer of liability. He submitted that there is no specific provision in the
Stamp Act contemplating such a situation whereas Legislature of Maharashtra had made necessary
amendments in the Stamp Act in order to take in its fold an order passed under Section 394 of the
Companies Act. The sum and substances of the submission was that the Stamp Act as applicable to
the State does not provide that an order under Section 394 of the Companies Act sanctioning a
scheme is liable to stamp duty. Therefore, this Court should refrain from holding so. This
submission of Mr. Banerjee has been reiterated by Mr. Mukherjee and has been duly dealt with by
me hereinabove. Therefore, I refrain from giving my reasons over again for rejecting this contention.
Mr. Banerjee cited 50 Comp. Cases 95. This judgment, in my view, is no authority for the
proposition advanced by him.
67. I have not dealt with submissions made by the learned Advocate General separately because his
submissions are reflected in the entire reasoning given by me.
68. Considering the view that I have taken I hold that an order sanctioning a scheme of
reconstruction amalgamation under Section 394 is covered by the definition of the words
'conveyance' and 'instrument' under the Indian Stamp Act and therefore liable to stamp duty. I
therefore direct that the Registrar of Companies shall not take on record an order sanctioning a
scheme until the same has been duly stamped. The department of this Court is directed to engross
the final order sanctioning a scheme under Section 394 of the Companies Act on an appropriate
stamp paper and thereafter the order should be placed for final signature. No copy of the order
should be issued without complying with the aforesaid direction. However, remission of stamp duty
shall be available in the case of a transfer envisaged under the notification N. 1 dated 16-1-1937. The
cases covered by the said notification shall therefore form an exception to the aforesaid direction
issued to the Registrar of Companies as well as the department of this Court. Let a copy of this
judgment be forwarded to the Registrar of Companies by the Registrar, Original Side of this Court.
