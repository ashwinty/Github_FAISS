(DELIVERED BY HON'BLE ASHOK BHUSHAN, J.) All these appeals have been filed under section
54 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 against two judgment and orders of the Additional District
Judge/District Judge Bulandshahr in Land Acquisition References. The First six appeals have been
filed against the judgment and order dated 14.9.1998 of III Additional District Judge Bulandshahr
deciding Land Acquisition Reference No. 205 of 1989, Land Acquisition Reference No. 234 of 1989
and Land Acquisition Reference No. 235 of 1989. The last two appeals have been filed against the
judgment and orders dated 6.11.1995 of District Judge, Bulandshahr deciding Land Acquisition
Reference No. 213 of 1989 and Land Acquisition Reference No. 239 of 1989. All these appeals have
arisen from the judgment and orders rendered by reference Court in reference made under section
18 of the Land Acquisition Act arising out of the same notifications under sections 4 and 6 of the
Land Acquisition Act. For deciding all these appeals, it shall be sufficient to refer the facts and
materials on record in First Appeal No. 62 of 1999, which is being treated as leading appeal. Certain
facts of first appeal No. 81 of 1996 are also to be noted.
A notification under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act dated 21.1.1970 was issued for acquisition
of land situate at Qasba Baran, Tahsil and district Bulandshahr. An area of 16 Bighas, 10 Biswas and
16 Biswansis was proposed to be acquired for construction of godown and sheds by the Food
Corporation of India. Declaration under section 6 was issued on 4.6.1971. The possession of land
was taken on 27.2.1982 and the award by Special Land Acquisition Officer was given on 3.12.1985.
The land was situated within the municipal area of Bulandshahr. Special Land Acquisition Officer
gave an award of Rs. 64,467.22 per Pakka Bigha for the land (Jungle Awwal Aabi), and an award of
Rs. 41,791.04 per Pakka Bigha for the land (Jungle Awwal Khaki). Bhagwat Prasad and Har Prasad,
sons of Kale Singh were Bhumidhars of plot No. 618, area 2 Bighas, 19 Biswas and plot No. 620 area
10 Biswas. The original tenure holder accepted the compensation under protest and submitted an
application before the Special Land Acquisition Officer for making a reference under section 18 of
the Land Acquisition Act for enhancement of the compensation. The original tenure holder claimed
compensation at the rate of Rs. 300/- per square yard with solatium and interest. After reference
under section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act, Bhagwat Prasad died on 1.11.1989 and in reference No.
205 of 1985 his widow Smt. Kundaniya was substituted. Smt. Kundaniya widow of Bhagwat Prasad
transferred her right of receiving compensation on 29.5.1997 in favour of Kailash Chand son of
Ramji Lal. The deed noted that for enhancement of compensation Land Acquisition Reference No.
205 of 1989 is pending in the Court of Additional District Judge and disposal of which is likely to
take sufficiently long time and she being in need of money is transferring all her rights to receive
compensation or any other amount in favour of Kailash Chand. Similarly Har Prasad also
transferred his right to receive compensation and any other amount towards acquisition of Plot Nos.
618 and 620 in favour of Akhtar Husain. On the basis of above registered deeds, the names of
Kailash Chand and Akhtar Husain were substituted in the Land Acquisition Reference No. 205 of
1989 and by order dated 7.8.1998, passed by the Additional District Judge under Order 22 Rule 10
C.P.C. the application filed on behalf of Akhtar Husain and Kailash Chand was allowed on 7.8.1998.
Before the reference Court both the parties led oral as well as documentary evidences in support of
their respective claims. In Land Acquisition Reference No. 205, 234 and 235, the claimants relied on
earlier judgements of the reference Court dated 19.5.1992 in Land Acquisition Reference No. 256 of
1987, judgment dated 31.5.1994 in Land Acquisition Reference No. 150 of 1992 and judgment dated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 3The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
31.5.1995 of the District Judge, Bulandshahr in Land Acquisition Reference No. 134 of 1995 and the
judgment dated 6.11.1995 in Land Acquisition Reference No. 239 of 1989, Tejpal Singh and others
Vs. State of U.P., Land Acquisition Reference No. 213 of 1989 Atul Kumar Vs. State of U.P. and
others. As already noted above, the First Appeal No. 64 of 1999 and First Appeal No. 106 of 1999
have been filed against the judgment and orders dated 6.11.1995 in Land Acquisition Reference No.
239 of 1989 and 213 of 1989.
The claimants examined Har Prasad, Nityanand Swaroop and Dhakkan. Food Corporation of India
filed ten exemplars in support of their claim and examined Mahabir (S.A.L.O.Amin), Y.P. Dewan,
District Manager of Food Corporation of India, S.K. Sharma, Assistant Manager of Food
Corporation of India and Mahendra Pal Sharma Assistant Grade-2.
In Land Acquisition Reference No. 213 and 239 of 1989 claimants relied on judgments dated
19.5.1992 and 31.5.1994 and examined Shanti Swaroop, Natthu Singh. In Land Acquisition
Reference No. 213 of 1989 Pratham Kumar and Atul Kumar appeared as witness for the claimant.
Food Corporation of India relied on ten exemplars and examined Mahabir , Y.P. Dewan, S. K.
Sharma, Mahendra Pal Singh and Nityanand Swaroop. Food Corporation of India had relied on
judgment dated 31.5.1995 delivered by the District Judge, Bulandshahr in Land Acquisition
Reference No. 324 Rajbala Vs. State of U.P. In Land Acquisition Reference No. 234 of 1989 giving
rise to first appeal No. 63 and 116 of 2000, original tenure holders transferred their rights to receive
compensation in favour of Hem Singh by registered sale deed dated 7.6.1997 and 6.8.1997. Similarly
in Land Acquisition Reference No. 235 of 1989 giving rise to first appeal No. 64 and 1062 of 1999,
original tenure holders transferred their right to receive compensation in favour of Kaluva and Vijay
by registered sale deed dated 24.5.1997. In Land Acquisition Reference No. 213 of 1999, the original
tenure holder died and in his place his legal heir (son) was substituted. The First Appeal No. 81 of
1996 arises out of Land Acquisition Reference No. 213 of 1989. Similarly in Land Acquisition
Reference No. 239 of 1989, original tenure holder died who was substituted by his legal heirs, giving
rise to first Appeal No. 82 of 1996.
From the facts as noted above, it is clear that first set of appeals i.e. first six appeals arise out of Land
Acquisition Reference proceedings, wherein during the pendency of the Land Acquisition Reference
under section 18 of Act, the original tenure holders transferred their rights to receive compensation
and other dues in favour of the respondents, whose names were also substituted in record of Land
Acquisition Reference proceedings under Order 22 Rule 10 C.P.C. The second set of appeal No. 81 of
1996 and 82 of 1996 are the appeals arising out of Land Acquisition Reference proceedings wherein
original tenure holders died and were substituted by legal heirs.
We have heard Sri V.B. Upadhya, learned Senior Advocate and Sri Prabodh Gaur on behalf of
appellants. Sri K.R. Sirohi, learned Senior Advocate and Ashok Tripathi have appeared for
respondents in first set of appeals. Sri B.D. Mandhyan, learned Senior Advocate has appeared for
the claimants in the second set of appeals.
Although several grounds have been taken in the above appeals for challenging the judgment and
order of Additional District Judge/District Judge Bulandshahr. However, Sri V.B. Upadhya, learned
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 4The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
Senior Advocate confined his submissions to the following effect:
1.The claimants, who obtained sale deeds from the original tenure holders during the
pendency of the Land Acquisition Reference are not entitled to receive any
compensation since their sale deeds were void. The original tenure holder could not
have transferred their right to prosecute the reference since the right to receive any
compensation in reference was nothing but "mere right to sue". "Mere right to sue"
cannot be transferred in view of section 6(e) of Transfer of Property Act, 1882.
Compensation which was not yet determined was only an unliquidated damages
which could not have been transferred. He submits that the original tenure holder
having transferred their right during the pendency of Land Acquisition Reference,
they had abandoned their claim for enhancement of compensation hence, those Land
Acquisition References were liable to be dismissed and transferees could not have
been allowed to prosecute the Land Acquisition References.
2.The exemplars filed by the Food Corporation of India were wrongly rejected by the
Additional District Judge in his judgment and order dated 14.7.1998 on erroneous
ground that the sale deeds have not been proved. It is submitted by Sri Upadhya that
certified copy of the sale deeds were admissible in evidence by virtue of section 51A of
the Land Acquisition Act. It is submitted that according to the exemplars submitted
by the Food Corporation of India , the award of compensation at the rate of Rs. 175/-
per square yard was excessive. Transfers made by the original tenure holders during
the pendency of Land Acquisition Reference were unconsignable and hit by section
23 of the Contract Act. Learned counsel for the appellant have placed reliance on the
various judgements of the apex Court as well as of this Court which shall be referred
to while considering the submissions in detail.
Sri K.R. Sirohi learned counsel for the claimants in first set of appeals refuting the submissions of
learned counsel for the appellants contended that right to receive compensation as well as right to
receive enhanced compensation is a property and have rightly been transferred by the original
tenure holders in favour of the respondents during the pendency of the Land Acquisition Reference.
It is submitted that above mentioned transfers were not hit by section 6(e) of the Transfer of
Property Act. It is submitted that the Additional District Judge after considering the oral evidence as
well as documentary evidence on record have determined the compensation at the rate of Rs. 175/-
per square yard which does not suffer from any error. It is submitted that the earlier award dated
6.11.1995 in Land Acquisition Reference No. 213 of 1989 and 239 of 1989 which arose from same
Land Acquisition notification was relevant and has rightly been relied by learned Additional District
Judge for determining the compensation. It is submitted that in the judgment dated 6.11.1995, the
Court has enhanced the compensation as Rs. 200/- per square yard. He submitted that exemplars
which were filed by the Food Corporation of India were photocopy of the sale deeds attested by a
Public Notary which were rightly ignored by the learned Additional District Judge as certified copy
of the sale deeds were not filed.

Sri B.D. Mandhyan, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the claimants in the second set of the
appeals supported the judgment and order dated 6.11.1995 of the District Judge Bulandshahr and
contended that the learned District Judge after considering the oral as well as documentary evidence
on record has determined the compensation at the rate of 200/- per square yard which does not
suffer from any error. He submits that the claimants have been deprived to receive the benefit of
enhanced compensation during the pendency of the appeal due to which the claimants have
suffered.
We have considered the submissions raised by learned Counsel for the parties and perused the
record.
From the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties following are the main issues, which
arise for consideration in these appeals:
1.Whether transfer of right to receive compensation in pending Land Acquisition
References is impermissible by virtue of Section 6(e) of the Transfer of Property Act,
1882?
2.Whether the right to receive enhanced compensation, if any is a transfer of right to
property or is transfer of "mere right to sue"?
3.Whether a transferees who obtained transfer during the pendency of Land
Acquisition References could have prosecuted the Land Acquisition References and
are entitled to receive enhanced compensation as per the orders passed by Additional
District Judge?
4.Whether the exemplars which were filed by the Food Corporation of India could
have been rejected on the ground that they have not been proved?
5.Whether in Land Acquisition Reference No. 205 of 1989 and other connected Land
Acquisition References, the earlier judgment dated 6.11.1995 making an award of Rs.
200/- per square yard could have been relied by Additional District Judge in his
judgment and order dated 14.9.1998?
6.Whether determination of Rs. 200/- per square yard by judgment and order dated
6.11.1995 by the District Judge, Bulandshahr in Land Acquisition References No. 239
and 213 of 1989 was based on a correct appreciation of material on record?
7.Whether there was sufficient material on record in Land Acquisition Reference No.
205 of 1989 for determination of compensation at the rate of Rs. 175/- per square
yard?
8.To what reliefs, the appellants are entitled in this appeal?

Issues No. 1,2 and 3 being interrelated are taken together. From the facts as noted above in first set
of appeals, both the parties do not dispute that during the pendency of Land Acquisition Reference,
the original tenure holders/ heirs of original tenure holders transferred their right to receive
enhanced compensation or any other sum in pending references in favour of the respondents to
these appeals. It is also not disputed that names of the transferees on the basis of various sale deeds
executed in 1997 were substituted on the record on an application filed by the transferees under
Order 22 Rule 10 C.P.C. and the transferees prosecuted Land Acquisition References. The issue is as
to whether the above mentioned transferees were prohibited in view of the provisions of section 6(e)
of the Transfer of Property Act and as to whether transfer of the right to receive enhanced
compensation is a transfer of any assets or property or the said transfer is only transfer of a "mere
right to sue".
The Transfer of Property Act, 1882 was enacted to define and amend certain parts of the law relating
to the transfer of property by act of parties. Section 5 defines transfer of property in following
manner:
"5. Transfer of property defined In the following sections "transfer of property"
means an act by which a living person conveys property, in present or in future, to
one or more other living persons, or to himself and one or more other living persons;
and "to transfer property" is to perform such act.
In this section "living person includes a company or association or body of
individuals, whether incorporated or not, but nothing herein contained shall affect
any law for the time being in force relating to transfer of property to or by companies,
associations or bodies of individuals."
Section 6 enumerates as to what may be transferred. Section 6(e) which is relevant for the present
case is as follows:
"6. What may be transferred Property of any kind may be transferred, except as
otherwise provided by this Act or by any other law for the time being in force.
(a) .........
(b) ..........
(c) ..........
(d) ...........
(dd) .........
(e) A mere right to sue cannot be transferred."

The word "property" has been defined in Law Lexicon, P. Ramanatha Aiyer 3rd Edition in following
manner:
""PROPERTY" includes any property over which or the profits of which any person
has a disposing power which he may exercise for his own benefit.
Something that is or may be owned or possessed; an estate; intangible assets or
intangible right (S.2(b), T.P. Act (4 of 1882) and S. 2(15), Estate Duty Act (34 of
1963); an exclusive right to possess, enjoy and dispose of; a quality or trait belonging
to a person or thing.
Property has been defined as the right and interest which a man has in lands and
chattels to the exclusion of others. The term "property" is a generic term of extensive
application, and while strictly speaking it means only the right which a person has in
relation to something, or that dominion or indefinite right of user and disposition
which one may lawfully exercise over particular things or objects, it is frequently used
to denote the subject of the property, or thing itself which is owned or in relation to
which the right of property exists. In the former sense it extends to every species of
valuable right or interest, in either real or personal property, or in easements,
franchises, and incorporeal hereditaments, and in the latter to everything which is
the subject of ownership, or to which the right of property may legally attach, or in
other words every class of acquisitions which a man can own or have an interest in.
Property is no men generalissimum, and extends to every species of valuable right
and interest including real and personal property easements, franchises, and other
incorporeal hereditaments."
The compensation is payable consequent to acquisition of land in accordance with the provisions of
the Land Acquisition Act. After vesting the land in the State either under section 16 or after taking
possession under section 17, the owner of a property has no right in the land and his only right is to
receive compensation. Right to receive compensation has been statutorily recognised under the
Land Acquisition Act. The compensation which is to be received by land owners consequent to land
acquisition is a valuable right and is a property within the meaning of Transfer of Property Act,
1882. The apex Court had occasion to consider nature of right to receive compensation in AIR 1976
S.C. 211 Union of India Vs. Iqbal Singh. Under the provisions of Displaced Persons (Compensation
and Rehabilitation) Act, 1954. Iqbal Singh a displaced person claimed compensation under the Act.
the Apex Court referring to statutory rules of compensation under the said Act held the said right as
a right to property and it was held that the compensation is covered by definition of property under
section 6 of the Transfer of Property Act. Following was laid down in paragraph 9:
"9. It is true that the Act is intended for payment of compensation for rehabilitation
of displaced persons and matters connected therewith. There is, however, nothing in
the Act to prevent a claimant from making a gift or a will in respect of the amount he
may be entitled to get. No provision of the Act takes away rights of transfer of or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 8The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
inheritance to verified claims. Nothing like an abatement or extinction of a claim by
the death of the claimant is provided for by the Act. Inheritance to and devolution of
rights of claimants are clearly beyond the purview or scheme of the Act. They are
untouched by the provisions of the Act and are governed by other provisions of law.
The statutory rights of claimants to compensation, which crystallize on assessment
and verification of claims, are separate rights to property of each claimant covered by
the wide definition of "property" in Section 6 of the Transfer of Property Act. They
cannot evaporate or vanish suddenly with the death of a claimant. Rules framed
under Section 40 of the Act have to be and are those reasonably necessary for
carrying out the purposes of the Act. They cannot go beyond the objects for which
they can be framed. Those objects are confined to determination and payment of
compensation for what was left in Pakistan and do not extend to deprivation of
anything acquired in India in capacities other than those relevant for purposes of
compensation"
The compensation to be awarded for acquisition of land under the Land Acquisition Act is also a
statutory recognised right.
There cannot be any dispute that the land owner is entitled for compensation consequent to
acquisition of his land. It is settled proposition of law that any transfer of land after issuance of
notification under section 4(1) by the owner of the land is void as against the State and such
transferee cannot be allowed to challenge acquisition of the land. However, there are series of the
decisions of the apex Court taking the view that such transferees step into the shoes of owner and is
entitled to claim compensation. It is relevant to refer two cases in this regard. The Apex Court in
(1995) 2 SCC 427 Union of India Vs. Shiv Kumar Bhargava and others held that a person who
purchases land subsequent to the notification under section 4 may be entitled to claim
compensation by virtue of sale deed in his favour but he cannot be said to be owner. Following was
laid down in paragraph 4:
"4. The policy of the Government indicates that the person whose land was acquired
means the owner as on the date, notification was notified for acquisition, and he
alone will be entitled to allotment of alternative site. A person who purchases land
subsequent to the Notification may be entitled to claim compensation by virtue of
sale made in his favour, namely, the right, title and interest the predecessor had but,
he cannot be said to be the owner for allotment since the right of ownership would be
determined with reference to the date on which Notification under Section 4(1) was
published. This was the view of this Court in another case while considering the Full
Bench Judgment of the Delhi High Court. Under these circumstances, the appeal is
allowed. The respondent cannot be considered to be the owner as on the date of
Notification under Section 4(1) published in the Gazette. The direction given by the
learned Single Judge is accordingly quashed. The Writ Petition stands dismissed. No
costs."

In (1996)3 SCC 124 U.P. Jal Nigam, Lucknow through its Chairman and another Vs. Kalra
Properties (P) Ltd. Lucknow and others, it has been laid down that the purchaser is an person
interested in compensation since he steps into the shoes of erstwhile owner. In the said case also
after issuance of notification under section 4 and after possession of the land was taken on 5.7.1973,
sale deed was taken by the respondents on 3.2.1989. Following was laid down in paragraph 4:
"4. The next question is: whether the respondent is entitled to compensation and, if
so, from what date and at what rate? The original owner has the right to the
compensation under Section 23(1) of the Act. Consequently, though the respondent
acquired no title to the land, at best he would be entitled to step into the shoes of the
owner and claim payment of the compensation, but according to the provisions of the
Act. It is settled law that the price prevailing as on the date of the publication of the
notification under Section 4(1) is the price to which the owner or person who has an
interest in the land is entitled to. Therefore, the purchaser as a person interested in
the compensation, since he steps into the shoes of erstwhile owner, is entitled to
claim compensation"
Similar view was taken by the apex Court in (2012) 12 SCC 133 V. Chandrasekaran and another Vs.
Administrative Officer and others. Following was laid down in paragraph 13:
"13. On the contrary, Shri S. Gomathi Nayagam, learned Additional Advocate General
appearing for the respondents, has vehemently opposed the appeals, contending that
the predecessor-in-interest, of the appellants did not raise any objection under
Section 5-A of the Act, with respect to such acquisition proceedings at any stage,
rather they accepted the compensation granted under protest. To receive an award
under protest is a legal requirement for the purpose of making a reference under
Section 18 of the Act. The quashing of the declaration under Section 6 of the Act
would not automatically apply to the suit land, as it was not the subject matter of
challenge with respect to the acquisition proceedings before court. The appellants did
not make any inquiry whatsoever, with respect to the title of the suit land, though
inquiry was sought to be made in relation to the said land, by different persons in
altogether different contexts. The report of the high powered committee appointed by
the Board itself, is self-contradictory, as they clearly provided that possession had
been taken and, in view of the fact that once possession is taken, the said land vests in
the State, free from all encumbrances under Section 16 of the Act, the same cannot be
divested. Therefore, the question of re-conveying the suit land in favour of the
appellants cannot possibly arise. Land can be released from acquisition proceedings
either under Section 48 of the Act, or in exercise of powers under the General Clauses
Act, 1897, but this can be done only prior to the vesting of the land in the State, which
in itself is prior to taking possession thereof. The appellants, being purchasers of the
said suit land, after more than 20 years of the Award, cannot challenge the
acquisition proceedings at such a belated stage. More so, the vendors were not
competent to make any transfer, as none of them had good title over the suit land.
Therefore, any and all sale transactions are illegal and void. The sale-deeds executed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 10The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
in favour of the appellants, do not confer upon them, any title. More so, the
subsequent purchasers cannot challenge the validity of the land acquisition. The
appeals lack merit and are therefore liable to be dismissed."
In the recent judgment of the apex Court in (2013) 5 SCC Rajasthan Industrial State Development
Corporation Vs. Sobnath Scindhiya Corporation Housing Society, referring to earlier judgments of
the apex Court, same proposition was laid down.
The above judgments have categorically laid down that purchasers can claim compensation which
was payable to original owner of the land. The distinction which has been sought to be made by
learned counsel for the appellant is that the present is a case where the land owners have already
received compensation and have made a reference for enhancement of the compensation. It is
submitted that reference application made under section 18 for enhancement of compensation is
nothing but initiation of litigation for enhancement of the compensation which right having been
transferred in favour of the respondents is only a mere right to sue and is hit by section 6(e) of the
Transfer of Property Act. Elaborating his submission, Sri Upadhya submits that the compensation if
at all payable consequent to the order of the civil Court is an unliquidated amount which cannot be
treated to be a property. The question is as to whether the right to receive compensation consequent
to acquisition of land can be demarcated in two parts i.e. (i) right to receive compensation as
awarded by Special Land Acquisition Officer under section 11 and (ii) compensation payable by
order of the civil court in a reference under section 18. Whether the amount of compensation
received consequent to reference under section 18 is not a part of compensation, is a question to be
answered. The apex Court had occasion to consider the nature of compensation consequent to
award by Special Land Acquisition Officer and compensation which became payable consequent to
reference under section 18 in AIR 1980 SC 775 M/s Khorshed Shapoor Chenai Vs. Assistant
Controller of Estate Duty Andhra Pradesh. Claimants right to receive compensation under sections
11,25 and 26 came for consideration in the said case. In the said case, the land of one Rashid
Shapoor Chenai was acquired by two notifications in the years 1961 and 1962. Two separate awards
were made on 31.1.1963 awarding compensation of Rs. 20,000 which was received by the land
owner. Subsequently two more parcels of land were acquired by issuance of notifications on
November 1, 1963 and February 1, 1964. After issuance of notification under section 6(1) the land
owner died. Award was made in the year 1965 and total compensation of Rs. 4,29,360/- was
awarded which was received by widow and son of the original tenure holder. The legal heirs of
tenure holder not being satisfied with the award had requested for reference under section 18. Civil
Court by its order dated 6.3.1967 enhanced the compensation by Rs. 1,90,000 and by Rs.
20,45,000/- respectively. The estate duty was assessed under the Estate Duty Act, 1953 on the basis
of enhanced compensation. The notices were issued under section 59A and Section 61 of the State
Duty Act, which notices were challenged in the High Court. The High court dismissed the writ
petition and upheld the notices against which special leave petition was filed in the apex Court. It
was contended on behalf of the appellant that proceedings for enhancement of compensation was
merely a right to litigate which could not be elevated to the status of any asset or property. It is
useful to note the above contention raised on behalf of the appellant which has been noted in
paragraph 8 of the judgment in following words:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 11The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
"8. Dealing first with C.A. No. 2205 of 1972, wherein the notice issued under s. 59(a)
of the Act has been challenged, counsel for the appellant raised three contentions
against the view taken by the High Court. At the outset the counsel pointed out that
so far as the E.D. assessment in respect of the,properties passing on the death of
Shapoor was concerned, the respondent as well as the High Court had proceeded on
the wrong assumption that the acquired lands formed part of the estate of the
deceased and passed on his death, for, it was on such basis that the High Court held
that having regard to the enhanced compensation granted by the Civil Court for the
lands such property (meaning lands) had been under-valued in the original
assessment and as such it had escaped assessment to duty. According to him the
lands no longer formed part of the estate of the deceased at the date of his death,
namely, on May 7, 1965, inasmuch as long prior thereto they had vested in the Govt.
and, therefore, it was merely the right to receive compensation, which, if at all, could
constitute property passing on the death of the deceased ; but he contended that
during the lifetime of the deceased the lands in question had not merely been
acquired but even the compensation as determined under the awards made by the
Special Deputy Collector was paid to and received by the deceased and hence at the
time of the death the initial right to receive compensation had already merged in
those awards and the only right which the deceased had was the right to agitate
against the correctness of the awards and nothing more and this right to claim
further compensation was a precarious right, being merely a right to litigate-a chancy
and dicey right, which could not be elevated to the status of any asset or property and
as such there was no question of any property having escaped the assessment to duty.
It was urged that such a right to further compensation would become property only
when the claim would be accepted finally by the court and till the enhanced
compensation became payable by reason of final adjudication of the court no
property could be said to have come into existence and certainly it was not in
existence at the date of death. It was pointed out that against the decrees passed by
the City Civil Court appeals had been preferred by the Govt. to the High Court and
even the High Court's decision might be carried in further appeal to this court and,
therefore, till the claim was finally accepted by the highest court no property
(enhanced compensation) could be said to have come into existence, Counsel urged
that it would run counter to all principles of direct taxation to regard the amount
decreed subsequently by the final court as property having come into existence
retrospectively on the relevant date (being the date of death under the E.D. Act and
valuation date under the W.T. Act) though, in fact, it did not exist on that date, and in
this behalf reliance was placed upon the decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court
in Khan Bahadur Ahmed Alladin & Sons v. CIT [1969] 74 ITR 651, 657, 658, two
decisions of the Calcutta High Court, namely, CWT v. U. C. Mahatab [1970] 78 ITR
214 and CIT v. Hindusthan Housing and Land Development Trust Ltd. [1977] 108
ITR 380, two decisions of the Gujarat High Court, namely, Topandas Kundanmal v.
CIT [1978] 114 ITR 237 and Addl. CIT v. New Jehangir Vakil Mills Co. Ltd. [1979] 117
ITR 849 and one decision of the Kerala High Court in M. Jairam v. CIT. [1979] 117
ITR 638. Secondly, counsel contended that assuming that the right to receive
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 12The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
compensation survived and it was that right which was being prosecuted by the heirs
of Rashid in the Civil Court, the impugned notice had not been issued on the ground
that such right to compensation had been under-valued on the earlier occasion and
required to be properly valued as at the date of death but the basis on which it was
issued was clearly unsustainable in law inasmuch as the respondent had issued it on
the assumption that there had been escapement of assessment to duty because the
lands in the original assessment had been under-valued in view of the glaring
enhanced compensation awarded by the Civil Court and the High Court's decision
upholding the issuance of such notice on the wrong basis was liable to be set aside.
Thirdly, counsel contended that seeking references under the Land Acquisition Act
and their pendency in Civil Court could not be said to be primary facts,
non-disclosure of which could amount to an omission or failure on the part of the
accountable person resulting in escapement of assessment to duty."
On behalf of the respondents the above submission was disputed. The apex Court after considering
the submissions held that the right to receive compensation at market value was a property which
constituted an asset. The argument that right to agitate the correctness of determination by Special
Land Acquisition Officer being merely the right to litigate was not an asset or property, was not
accepted in paragraph 10 which is quoted as below:
"10. As stated above, so far as the E.D. assessment in respect of the properties passing
on the death of Shapoor was concerned, counsel for the revenue fairly conceded that
the lands which were the subject-matter of acquisition proceedings could not be
regarded as forming part of the estate of the deceased on the relevant date and could
not pass on his death inasmuch as those lands had vested in the Govt. long prior to is
death but the right to receive compensation at market value on the dates of the
relevant notifications unquestionably accrued to the deceased which was property
and it would be such property that would pass on the death of the deceased. That
such right is property is well settled and if necessary reference may be made to a
decision of this court in Pandit Lakshmi Kant Jha v. CWT[1973] 90 ITR 97, a case
under the W.T. Act, 1957, where it has been clearly held that the right to receive
compensation in respect of the zamindari estate which was acquired by the Govt.
under the Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950, even though the date of payment was
deferred, was property and constituted an asset for the purpose of that taxing statute.
In other words, since the lands were lost to the estate of the deceased before the
relevant date, namely, the date of death, it would be the right to receive
compensation under the Land Acquisition Act that will have to be evaluated under
the E.D. Act. Counsel for the appellant did not dispute this position but he contended
that no sooner the Collector (the Special Deputy Collector herein) made his awards
determining the amounts of compensation payable to the claimants under s. 11 of the
Land Acquisition Act, the right to receive compensation must be regarded as having
merged in the awards, the determination having been made by a statutory public
official and what the claimants would be left with thereafter was merely a right to
agitate the correctness of such determination and this right to claim further
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 13The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
compensation being merely a right to litigate was no asset or property and further
that such right would become asset or property only after the Civil Court finally
adjudicated upon such claim. The High Court, while negativing this contention, has
held that the " right to receive extra compensation " was not a separate or different
right independent of " the right to receive compensation ". It has observed thus :
" The right to receive compensation for the lands acquired by the Government, at
their market value on the date of acquisition is one indivisible right. There is no right
to ' receive compensation ' and a separate right to receive ' extra compensation '. The
only right is to receive compensation for the lands acquired by the Government,
which is the fair market value on the date of acquisition.
The argument of the learned counsel that the right to receive extra compensation
accrued when the Civil Court passed the order and not before, does not merit
acceptance. The so-called right to receive extra compensation cannot be torn from or
considered separately from the right to receive the market value of the lands acquired
by the Government. The right accrues to the owner of the lands as soon as the lands
are acquired by the Government. It is, therefore, difficult to accept the argument of
the learned counsel for the petitioner that a fresh and an independent right to '
receive extra compensation ' accrued to the heirs of the deceased and that it was
owned and possessed by the heirs of the deceased. "
The view of the High Court that there are no two separate rights i.e. (i) right to receive compensation
(ii) right to receive further extra compensation of acquisition of land was approved. It was held by
the apex Court that there is only one right i.e. to receive compensation of land at the rate of its
market value on the date of notification. The above proposition was laid down in paragraph 11,
which is quoted below:
"11. In our opinion, the High Court was right in holding that there are no two
separate rights-one a right to receive compensation and the other, a right to receive
extra or further compensation. Upon acquisition of his lands under the Land
Acquisition Act the claimant has only one right which is to receive compensation for
the lands at their market value on the date of the relevant notification and it is this
right which is quantified by the Collector under s.11 and by the Civil Court under s. 26
of the Land Acquisition Act. It is true that under s.11 the Collector after holding the
necessary inquiry determines the quantum of compensation by fixing the market
value of the land and in doing so is guided by the provisions contained in ss. 23 and
24 of the Act-the very provisions by reference to which the Civil Court fixes the
valuation. It is also true that the Collector's award is, under s. 12 declared to be,
except as otherwise provided, final and conclusive evidence as between him and the
persons interested. Even so, it is well settled that in law the Collector's award under
s.11 is nothing more than an offer of compensation made by the Govt. to the
claimants whose property is acquired. (Vide Privy Council decision in Ezra v.
Secretary of State for India [1905] ILR 32 Cal 605), and this court's decisions in Raja
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 14The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
Harish Chandra v. Dy. Land Acquisition Officer [1962] 2 SCR 676 ; AIR 1961 SC 1500
and Dr. G. H. Grant v. State of Bihar [1965] 3 SCR 576 ; AIR 1966 SC 237. If that be
the true nature of the award made by the Collector then the question whether the
right to receive compensation survives the award must depend upon whether the
claimant acquiesces therein fully or not. If the offer is acquiesced in by total
acceptance the right to compensation will not survive but if the offer is not accepted
or is accepted under protest and a land reference is sought by the claimant under s.
18, the right to receive compensation must be regarded as having survived and kept
alive which the claimant prosecutes in a Civil Court. It is impossible to accept the
contention that no sooner the Collector has made his award under s. 11 the right to
compensation is destroyed or ceases to exist or is merged in the award, or what is left
with the claimant is a mere right to litigate the correctness of the award. The claimant
can litigate the correctness of the award because his right to compensation is not fully
redeemed but remains alive which he prosecutes in a Civil Court. That is why when a
claimant dies in a pending reference his heirs are brought on record and are
permitted to prosecute the reference. This, however, does not mean that the Civil
Court's evaluation of this right done subsequently would be its valuation as at the
relevant date either under the E.D. Act or the W.T. Act. It will be the duty of the
assessing authority under either of the enactments to evaluate this property (right to
receive compensation at market value on the date of relevant notification) as on the
relevant date (being the date of death under the E.D. Act and valuation date under
the W.T. Act). Under s. 36 of the E.D. Act the assessing authority has to estimate the
value of this property at the price which it would fetch if sold in the open market at
the time of the deceased's death. In the case of the right to receive compensation,
which is property, where the Collector's award has been made but has not been
accepted or has been accepted under protest and a reference is sought or is pending
in a Civil Court at the date of the deceased's death, the estimated value can never be
below the figure quantified by the Collector because under s. 25(1) of the Land
Acquisition Act, the Civil Court cannot award any amount below that awarded by the
Collector, the estimated value can be equal to the Collector's award or more but can
never be equal to the tall claim made by the claimant in the reference nor equal to the
claim actually awarded by the Civil Court inasmuch as the risk or hazard of litigation
would be a detracting factor while arriving at a reasonable and proper value of this
property as on the date of the deceased's death. The assessing authority will have to
estimate the value having regard to the peculiar nature of the property, its
marketability and the surrounding circumstances including the risk ,or hazard of
litigation looming large at the relevant date. The first contention of counsel for the
appellant, therefore, fails."
Apex Court in (1985) 1 SCC 231 Joginder Singh and others Vs. State of Punjab & Ors held that right
to compensation and quantification thereof are two distinct concept. The right to compensation
arises when the land vests in the State, whereas the process of quantification may pass through
several stages. Following was laid down in paragraph 3:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 15The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
"3. ....... In so far that the High Court recognises the appellants' claim to interest from
that date the High Court is right, because the right to compensation arises when the
land is acquired, and the judgment of the High Court merely represents a stage in the
process of quantifying the compensation. The right to compensation and the
quantification thereof are two distinct concepts. The right to compensation arises
when the land vests in the State while its quantification may be concluded much
later. Although the process of quantification may pass through several stages, from
the Land Acquisition Officer to the District Judge and thereafter to the High Court,
the process of quantification is merely one of computing the value of the land, on the
principles enacted in the Land Acquisition Act. All along, however, the right to the
compensation so quantified refers back to the date of acquisition. The additional
amount of compensation awarded by the District Judge or by the High Court
represents the difference between the true value of the land on the one hand and the
actual amount awarded on the other which fell short of the true value. The owner of
the land is entitled to be paid the true value of the land on the date of taking over of
possession. Since, however, the true value is usually determined only after it is
computed through a multi-tiered process passing through different levels of a
hierarchical judicial structure by the very nature of things it take sometime before the
true value can be finally determined. The fact that it is determined later does not
mean that the right to the amount comes into existence at a later date. And if, as the
High Court has held, interest at 6 per cent per annum rules from the date procession
was taken in the case of compensation determined by the learned District Judge,
there is no reason why the same rate should not be applied from the date possession
was taken in the case of the enhancement effected by the High Court."
The above case also clearly supports the view that in reference proceedings under section 18 for
determination of compensation, correct market value of the land is part and parcel of the same right
of compensation to which a owner is entitled. The transferee is also entitled for the same right by
virtue of he having stepped in the shoes of owner after transfer.
From the above judgment of the apex Court, it is clear that right to receive compensation covers
both the stages i.e. right to receive compensation as awarded by Special Land Acquisition Officer
and if determination is disputed, to receive compensation as determined by the civil Court on a
reference under section 18. the right to receive compensation consequent to determination by civil
court cannot be said to be "mere right to sue". The right to sue is coupled with right to receive
compensation at the correct market value. The right to sue is attached with right to receive the
correct market value of the land acquired and cannot be termed as "mere right to sue". Right to sue
is thus attached to a property i.e. compensation which is to be determined by the Civil Court after
reference under section 18. Thus, the transfer made by owners during the pendency of reference
under section 18 was transfer of their rights to receive compensation at the correct market value of
the property. In this context, it is relevant to note the contents of one of the sale deeds executed by
land owners to the transferee. The sale deed dated 19.5.1997 executed by Smt. Kundaniya in favour
of Kailash Chand and sale deed by Har Prasad in favour of Akhtar Husian dated 28.8.1997 have
been brought on record on the paper book vol. No. 4 at item nos. 12 and 13. The sale deeds mention
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 16The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
that compensation awarded by the land acquisition officer have been received with protest and
reference have been made under section 18 to the Civil court which is pending consideration in the
Court of IV Additional District Judge. The sale deed recites that all rights to receive compensation is
being transferred in favour of the transferee. There cannot be any dispute that original owners have
right to receive compensation as awarded by the civil Court in a reference under section 18. Transfer
of right to receive such compensation is a transfer of a property and cannot be termed to be transfer
of "mere right to sue".
Learned Counsel for the appellants has placed much reliance on two Division Bench judgments of
this Court reported in 1998 (2) AWC 1002 Mahesh Chand Gupta Vs. State of U.P. and others, 2004
(3) AWC 2195, Agra Development Authority Vs. State of U.P. and others. In Mahesh Chand Gupta's
case, the writ petition was filed by a transferee from original tenure holders for issuance of a writ of
mandamus directing the respondents to pay compensation under section 28A. The Division Bench
construing section 3(b) of Land Acquisition Act which defines the expression "person interested"
held that the said expression has to be given a wide meaning. The Division Bench however, held in
the said case that the petitioners of that case were not claiming compensation but claiming
redetermination of compensation under section 28A. The Court held that compensation which may
be awarded as a result of determination under section 28A is different from the compensation which
is determined by the Collector under section 11 or by Court under section 18. Following was laid
down in paragraph 5:
"5. Section 3(b) of the Act defines the expression "person interested" and it includes
all persons claiming an interest in compensation to be made on account of the
acquisition of land under the Act, and a person shall be deemed to be interested in
land if he is interested in an easement affecting the land. The expression has been
given a wide meaning. However, what the petitioners are claiming is not
compensation but a redetermination of compensation under Section 28A of the Act.
The compensation which may be awarded as a result of redetermination under
Section 28A is different from the compensation which is determined by the Collector
under Section 11 of the Act or by the Court on a reference under Section 18 of the Act.
Section 28A was inserted by Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act. 1984 (Act No. 64 of
1984) by which major amendments in Land Acquisition Act, 1894 were Introduced.
Para 1 of the statement of object and reasons reads as follows :
"With the enormous expansion of the State's role in promoting public welfare and
economic development since independence, acquisition of land for public purposes,
industrialization building of institutions, etc., has become far more numerous than
ever before. While this is inevitable, promotion of public purpose has to be balanced
with the rights of the individual whose land is acquired, thereby often depriving him
of his means of livelihood. Again, acquisition of land for private enterprises ought not
to be placed on the same footing as acquisition for the State or for an enterprise
under it. The individual and institutions who are unavoidably to be deprived of their
property rights in land need to be adequately compensated for the loss keeping in
view the sacrifice they have to make for the larger interests of the community. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 17The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
pendency of acquisition proceedings for long periods often causes hardship to the
affected parties and renders unrealistic the scale of compensation offered to them."
In para 2, the main proposals for amendment are given and clause (ix) reads as follows :
"Considering the right of reference to the civil court under Section 18 of the Act is not
usually taken advantage of by inarticulate and poor people and is usually exercised
only by the comparatively affluent land-owners and that this causes considerable
inequality in the payment of compensation for the same or similar quality of land to
different interested parties, it is proposed to provide an opportunity to all aggrieved
parties whose land is covered under the same Notification to seek redetermination of
compensation, once any one of them has obtained orders for payment of higher
compensation from the reference court under Section 18 of the Act."
The above observation of the Court clearly makes it clear that the said judgment was delivered in
context of section 28A and court itself has held that a transferee may be a person interested in so far
as compensation under section 11 awarded by Special Land Acquisition Officer or compensation
awarded by civil Court is concerned. The said judgment is thus clearly distinguishable and does not
help the appellants.
Next judgment on which much reliance has been placed is judgment in Agra Development Authority
(supra). In the said case award was given by the Special Land Acquisition Officer. Prior to award, the
respondent society had taken different sale deeds dated 6.6.1991 and 7.8.1991. Reference was filed
by the transferee under section 18. During pendency of the reference, the society further made
transfer in favour of respondents no. 5 to 11. The reference court enhanced the compensation
against which order, the Agra Development Authority filed a writ petition. In the above context, the
Division Bench held that mere right to sue was transferred which is hit by section 6(e) of the
Transfer of Property Act. The Division Bench held that in those cases, the respondents have not
purchased any property but only the litigation. The facts of the case have been noted in paragraphs 2
and 3 which are quoted as below:
"2. In First Appeal No. 981 of 2002 the land in question belonged to Bhoop Singh and
others who sold their right in the land after notification under Sections 4 and 6 of the
Land Acquisition Act in favour of a society respondent No. 3 (a) to the petition,
represented by its Secretary respondent No. 4 for a sum of Rs. 18,69,904 by 13
different sale deeds executed on 6.6.1991 and 7.8.1991.
3. The S.L.A.O. gave his award under Section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act on
8.11.199,1 awarding Rs. 19,12,366.70 paise which was received by the respondent No.
3 (a). Thereafter, the society filed a reference application under Section 18 of the
Land Acquisition Act and during the pendency of the reference application, the
society transferred all its rights in respect of the property and the litigation in favour
of respondent Nos. 5 to 11 for a sum of Rs. 1,35,000. The compensation awarded to
respondent Nos. 5 to 11 is Rs. 1,02,99,491. Against this judgment of the court below
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 18The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
the first appeal has been filed."
The Division Bench recorded its conclusions in paragraphs 9,10,19,20,21,23 and 24 which are
quoted below:
"9. These facts disclose the scandalous state of affairs prevailing in the District Courts
of the U.P. and it is no wonder that the public is disgusted with this state of affairs
which smacks of rampant corruption.
10.In our opinion all these appeals deserve to be allowed on the short point that a
mere right to sue cannot be transferred as it is hit by Section 6(e) of the Transfer of
Property Act. In all these cases the respondents have not purchased any property but
only the litigation, which is violative of Section 6(e).
19. In the present case we are of the opinion that what has been transferred is a mere
right to sue and not any property or an actionable claim.
20. It is crystal clear that in the present case, the land was not transferred but merely
a right to pursue the litigation to recover compensation was transferred. In our
opinion, this is clearly prohibited by Section 6(e) of the T. P. Act and therefore, the
conveyance deeds in favour of the respondents are wholly invalid and they cannot
maintain any claim on their basis.
21.The land had vested with the Government free from all encumbrances when
possession of the same was taken as the Government had invoked the provisions of
Section 17(1) an (4) of the Act. The deed in favour of the contesting respondent were
executed long after the date of vesting, and hence the vendors and vendees were fully
aware that the land was not being transferred. Hence such transfers are violative of
Section 6(e) of the Transfer of Property Act.
23. First Appeal No. 981 of 2002 has been filed against the judgment and order dated
29.8.2002. In that judgment Issue No. 9 was framed as follows :
"Whether the transferees of the original claimants, are entitled to the compensation
in place of the original claimant? If so to what extent?
24. The answer to Issue No. 9 has been given by the court below in the affirmative
holding that the right of compensation is a transferable right. However, in view of the
reasons expressed by us above we are of the opinion that the aforesaid issue has not
been rightly decided and the correct legal position is that the transferees of the
original claimants, have no right to get compensation as a mere right to sue cannot be
transferred."

Another Division Bench judgment on which reliance has been placed by learned Counsel for the
claimants is Division Bench judgment in U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad Vs. Kanak & Ors. decided
on 26.5.2010 reported in 2012 (6)ADJ 444. The Division Bench in U.P. Avas Vikas Parishad's case
also had occasion to consider the same submission that the transfer made by original tenure holders
was of mere right to sue which was hit by section 6(e). Repelling the said submissions, the Division
Bench after referring to M/s Khorshed Shapoor Chenai Vs. Assistant Controller of Estate Duty
Andhra Pradesh (supra) held that transfers were not hit by section 6(e). Following was laid down in
paragraphs 51 to 63.
"51. In the second category of first appeals (i.e. FA Nos. 273/94, 274/94, 368/97,
370/97, 263/98 & 555/99), the landowners themselves received the compensation
amount as was determined by the Spl. LAO, who did not accept the award and sought
for the reference by moving their written applications. During the pendency of the
reference proceedings before the Tribunal, they assigned their rights en mass
including their right to receive compensation and to prosecute their reference
proceedings. Pursuant thereto, these post-award assignees got their names added
/substituted by the Tribunal's orders on the basis of the consent given by the
assignors and continued the reference proceedings. The Tribunal ultimately awarded
a higher amount of compensation to these 'post-award assignees'.
52.Against the above factual backdrop, the true nature of the rights acquired by the
assignees (the claimants in these 14 appeals) for both the stages i.e. 'pre-award' and
'post-award' needs examination.
53.For this purpose, if we examine the scheme of the LA Act, it reveals that a land
"vests" in the Government absolutely free from all encumbrances when its possession
is taken either under S. 16 (post- award) or 17(1) (pre-award) of the LA Act.
Immediately with the taking of the possession, the rights of a landowner extinguishes
who acquires a vested, irrevocable and indefeasible 'right to receive compensation' as
per the LA Act, though it may be actually quantified later on and at different stages.
In Joginder Singh and Ors. v. State of Punjab, (1985) 1 SCC 231, it was succinctly held
that "the right to compensation and the quantification thereof are two distinct
concepts. The right to compensation arises when the land vests in the State while its
quantification may be concluded much later. Although the process of quantification
may pass through several stages, from the Land Acquisition Officer to the District
Judge and thereafter to the High Court, the process of quantification is merely one of
computing the value of the land, on the principles enacted in the Land Acquisition
Act. All along, however, the right to the compensation so quantified refers back to the
date of acquisition."
54. Therefore, it is crystal clear that at the pre-award stage, an ex-owner is entitled to receive
compensation per the Collector's award with his valuable right to seek a reference u/s 18 of the LA
Act against such award. However, when an award is already made by the Collector which is not
accepted by the person interested, he can, at that post-award stage, seek a reference u/s 18 of the LA
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 20The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
Act to get his compensation judicially determined by the Reference Court subject to further appeals
to the High Court and the Supreme Court. In both these 'pre-award' and 'post-award' stages, the
rights possessed by an ex-owner constitute "property" in view of the binding dictum of Mrs.
Khorshed Shapoor Chenai (supra), wherein the contrary contention raised before the Supreme
Court was as below (vide para 8):
" ....... the compensation as determined under the awards made by the Special Deputy
Collector was paid to and received by the deceased and, hence, at the time of the
death the initial right to receive compensation had already merged in those awards
and the only right which the deceased had was the right to agitate against the
correctness of the award and nothing more and this right to claim further
compensation was a precarious rights, being merely a right to litigate - a chancy and
dicey right, which could not be elevated to the status of any asset or property and as
such, there was no question of any property having escaped the assessment to duty. It
was urged there that such a right to further compensation would become property
only when the claim would be accepted finally by the Court and till the enhanced
compensation became payable by reason of final adjudication of the Court, no
property could be said to have come into existence ......."
55. The above quoted contention was rejected by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and clearly settled that
the rights of an ex-owner at both the 'pre-award stage' and the 'post-award stage' constituted a
property. While dealing with the 'pre-award stage rights' (i.e. where land has already vested in the
Government but the compensation was not received), it was observed as under (vide para 10):
"....... the right to receive compensation at market value on the dates of the relevant
notifications unquestionably accrued to the deceased which was property and it
would be such property that would pass on the death of the deceased. That such right
is property is well settled and if necessary reference may be made to a decision of this
Court in Pandit Lakshmi Kant Jha v. CWT, (1974) 3 SCC 126, a case under the Wealth
Tax Act, 1957 where it has been clearly held that the right to receive compensation in
respect of the Zamindari Estate which was acquired by the Government under the
Bihar Land Reforms Act, 1950, even though the date of payment was deferred, was
property and constituted an asset for the purpose of that taxing statute." (Emphasis
added)
56. In Pandit Lakshmi Kant Jha (supra), the contention was that since the amount of compensation
payable under the Bihar Land Reforms Act was not determined, therefore, it be excluded from the
assets of the assessee for the purposes of the Wealth Tax Act. While rejecting this contention, the
Supreme Court ruled:
"Assuming for the sake of argument that the amount of compensation payable to the
assessee had not been determined by the Compensation Officer by the valuation date,
that fact would not justify the exclusion of the compensation payable from the assets
of the assessee. The right to receive compensation became vested in the assessee the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 21The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
moment he was divested of his estate and the same got vested in the State in
pursuance of the provision of Bihar Land Reforms Act. As the estate of the assessee
which vested in the State was known and as the formula fixing the amount of
compensation was prescribed by the statute, the amount of compensation was to all
intents and purposes a matter of calculation. The fact that the necessary calculation
had not been made and the amount of compensation payable to the assessee out of
the definition of assets or make it cease to be property." (para 19)
57.Pandit Laxmikant Jha (supra) was, later, followed by the Supreme Court in CWT v. Smt. Anjamli
Khan, 1991 Sup. (2) SCC 681 and CWT v. U.C. Mehtab, (1997) 10 SCC 252. In UP Jal Nigam v. Kalra
Properties (P) Ltd, (1996) 3 SCC 124 also, the view taken by the Supreme Court was that the
purchaser would be entitled to step into the shoes of the owner and to claim payment of the
compensation according to the provisions of the LA Act.
58.It may also be mentioned that the Court of Appeal in England, more than a century back, in its
judgment of Mrs. Dawson (supra) also held that "his right to be paid compensation under the notice
to treat, which is not simply a right to claim damages for a wrongful act, but is a right to a payment
under the terms of a statute and to be ascertained in the way prescribed by the legislature, which is
to be regarded as the price payable for the exercise by the undertakes of their statutory powers, and
as such is property." This opinion is also clearly in line with the view taken by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court.
59. Mrs. Khorshed Shapoor Chenai (supra) also clearly lays down that even at the 'post-award stage',
the rights of an ex-owner constitute a property, if a reference against the award is sought under S. 18
of the LA Act. It was held as below (vide para 11):
"In our opinion the High Court was right in holding that there are no two separate
rights -one a right to receive compensation and other a right to receive extra or
further compensation. Upon acquisition of his lands under the LA Act, the claimant
has only one right which is to receive compensation for the lands at their market
value on the date of the relevant notification and it is this right which is quantified by
the Collector under S. 11 and by the Civil Court under S. 26 of the LA Act. It is true
that under S. 11, the Collector after holding the necessary inquiry determines the
quantum of compensation by fixing the market value of the land and in doing so is
guided by the provisions contained in S. 23 and 24 of the Act - the very provisions by
reference to which the Civil Court fixes the valuation. It is also true that the
Collector's award is, under S. 12, declared to be, except as otherwise provided, final
and conclusive evidence as between him and the persons interested. Even so, it is
well settled that in law the Collector's award under S. 11 is nothing more than an offer
of compensation made by the Government to the claimants whose property is
acquired. [Vide Privy Council decision in Ezra v. Secretary of State for India, 32 IA 93
(PC) and this Court's decisions in Raja Harish Chandra v. Deputy. LAO, AIR 1961 SC
1500 and Mr. G.H. Grant v. State of Bihar, AIR 1966 SC 237. If that be the true nature
of the award made by the Collector then the question whether the right to receive
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 22The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
compensation survives the award must depend upon whether the claimant
acquiesces therein fully or not. If the offer is acquiesced in by total acceptance the
right to compensation will not survive but if the offer is not accepted or is accepted
under protest and a land reference is sought by the claimant under S. 18, the right to
receive compensation must be regarded as having survived and kept alive which the
claimant prosecutes in civil court. It is impossible to accept the contention that no
sooner the Collector has made his award under S. 11, the right to compensation is
destroyed or ceases to exist or is merged in the award, or what is left with the
claimant is a mere right to litigate the correctness of the award."
60.As to the right of an owner in a reference proceedings, it was also observed by the Supreme Court
that "the claimant can litigate the correctness of the award because his right to compensation is not
fully redeemed but remains alive which he prosecutes in civil court. That is why when a claimant
dies in a pending reference his heirs are brought on record and are permitted to prosecute the
reference."
61.In view of the above binding decisions of the Supreme Court, it is crystal clear that the "right to
receive compensation" in respect of an acquired land both at 'pre-award' and 'post-award' stages is a
"property" and the contrary contention of the Parishad is totally devoid of any substance and is,
accordingly, rejected.
62.The contention raised on behalf of the Parishad that the rights assigned by the ex-landowners
both at 'pre-award' and 'post-award' stages were "mere right to sue" and their assignments were hit
by S. 6(e) of the TP Act, has also no force. As held above, the rights assigned by the ex-tenure
holders constituted a "property" which could not be termed as a "mere right to sue". It may be
recalled that S. 6 of the TP Act provides for that the "property of any kind may be transferred except
as otherwise provided by this Act or any other law for the time being in force." The exceptions to this
general rule of transferability of a property, as stipulated in S. 6, are enumerated from clauses (a) to
(i) but none of these clauses forbids the transfer of the "compensation rights". No other provision of
the TP Act or any other law also prohibits its transfer. Rather, S. 8 of the TP Act further envisages
the incidences of a transfer by postulating that "unless a different intention is expressed or
necessarily implied, a transfer of property passes forthwith to the transferee all the interest which
the transferor is then capable of passing in the property and in the legal incidents thereof." As such,
a transfer of a property "vests" in the transferee the entire interest of the transferor with all legal
incidents thereof, unless the parties intend differently. In view of S. 8 of the TP Act, it would be
evident that the transfer of the property (namely, the right to receive compensation) vested in the
assignees all the rights of the assignor and the assignees, thereby, entered into their shoes with the
right to recover the compensation.
63. Further, the word 'mere' as employed in S. 6(e) of the TP Act is significant, which depicts the
distinction between a 'mere right to sue' and a 'right to sue'. It needs mention that it is now settled
law that no legal bar exists to transfer a "right to sue" as one of the incidents attached to a "property"
vide Union of India v. Shri Sharada Mills, (1972) 2 SCC 877 and Mrs. Dawson v. Great Northern &
City Rail Co. (supra). Thus, the law is that the "right to sue" can be assigned as an incidental,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 23The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
ancillary and subsidiary right in favour of an assignee alongwith the right to recover the assigned
property. The assignment of the "right to sue" should necessarily be along with the property and not
de hors the property."
In view of the above two Division Benches taking divergent views, in normal course, we would have
made a reference to a Larger Bench to determine the issue but in view of the law laid down by the
apex Court in M/s Khorshed Shapoor Chenai Vs. Assistant Controller of Estate Duty Andhra
Pradesh (supra) and other cases of the apex Court as noted above, laying down that transferee is
entitled to receive compensation, who steps in the shoes of owner and said judgments having not
been noticed by the Division Bench judgment in Agra Development Authority's case (supra), and We
bound by the law declared by the apex Court in the said case, no useful purpose shall be served by
making a reference to Larger Bench. The right to receive compensation both as awarded by Special
Land Acquisition Officer as well as enhanced compensation awarded by the civil Court under section
18 being integral part of the compensation, it is a right in property capable of transfer. We proceed,
following the law laid down by the apex court in the above case and do not feel any necessity of
making reference to a Larger Bench.
Learned Counsel for the appellant has also placed much reliance on the judgment of the apex court
reported in (2010) 4 SCC 114 Economic Transport Organisation Delhi Vs. Charan Spinning Mills
Pvt. Ltd. and another. In the said case, first respondent a manufacturer of the cotton yarn took a
policy of insurance from the second respondent i.e. National Insurance Company Ltd. The first
respondent entrusted a consignment of hosiery cotton yarn to the appellant for transportation and
delivery to a consignee at Calcutta. The goods vehicle carrying the consignment met with an accident
and consequently completely damaged. On the basis of a surveyor's certificate issued after
assessment of the damage, the second respondent settled the claim of the first respondent for
Rs.447,436/- On receiving the payment, the first respondent executed a Letter of
Subrogation-cum-Special Power of Attorney in favour of the second respondent. Thereafter,
respondents 1 and 2 filed a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 against the
appellant before the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, claiming compensation of
Rs.447,436/-with interest at 12% per annum, for deficiency in service. The claim was allowed by the
District Forum. The appeal filed by the appellant before the State Consumer Dispute Redressal
Commission as well as revision before the National Forum was rejected. The appellant in the above
context filed the Special Leave Petition. The apex Court in the above context laid down following in
paragraphs 16 and 17:
"16. If a letter of subrogation containing terms of assignment is to be treated only as
an assignment by ignoring the subrogation, there may be the danger of document
itself becoming invalid and unenforceable, having regard to the bar contained in
Section 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 ('TP Act' for short). Section 6 of
Transfer of Property Act, 1882, provides that property of any kind may be transferred
except as otherwise provided by that Act or by any other law for the time being in
force. Clause (e) of the said section provides that mere right to sue cannot be
transferred. Section 130 provides the manner of transfer of actionable claims. Section
3 defines an 'actionable claim' as : (i) any debt (other than a debt secured by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 24The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
mortgage of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of movable property)
or (ii) any beneficial interest is movable property not in the possession, either actual
or constructive of the claimant, which the civil courts recognizes as affording grounds
for relief. A 'debt' refers to an ascertained sum due from one person to another, as
contrasted from unliquidated damages and claims for compensation which requires
ascertainment/assessment by a Court or Tribunal before it becomes due and payable.
A transfer or assignment of a mere right to sue for compensation will be invalid
having regard to Section 6(e) of the TP Act. But when a letter of
subrogation-cum-assignment is executed, the assignment is interlinked with
subrogation, and not being an assignment of a mere right to sue, will be valid and
enforceable.
17. The principles relating to subrogation can therefore be summarized thus:
(i) Equitable right of subrogation arises when the insurer settles the claim of the
assured, for the entire loss. When there is an equitable subrogation in favour of the
insurer, the insurer is allowed to stand in the shoes of the assured and enforce the
rights of the assured against the wrongdoer.
(ii) Subrogation does not terminate nor puts an end to the right of the assured to sue
the wrong-doer and recover the damages for the loss. Subrogation only entitles the
insurer to receive back the amount paid to the assured, in terms of the principles of
subrogation.
(iii) Where the assured executes a Letter of Subrogation, reducing the terms of
subrogation, the rights of the insurer vis--vis the assured will be governed by the
terms of the Letter of Subrogation.
(iv) A subrogation enables the insurer to exercise the rights of the assured against
third parties in the name of the assured. Consequently, any plaint, complaint or
petition for recovery of compensation can be filed in the name of the assured, or by
the assured represented by the insurer as subrogee-cum-attorney, or by the assured
and the insurer as co-plaintiffs or co-complainants.
(v) Where the assured executed a subrogation-cum-assignment in favour of the
insurer (as contrasted from a subrogation), the assured is left with no right or
interest. Consequently, the assured will no longer be entitled to sue the wrongdoer on
its own account and for its own benefit. But as the instrument is a
subrogation-cum-assignment, and not a mere assignment, the insurer has the choice
of suing in its own name, or in the name of the assured, if the instrument so provides.
The insured becomes entitled to the entire amount recovered from the wrongdoer,
that is, not only the amount that the insured had paid to the assured, but also any
amount received in excess of what was paid by it to the assured, if the instrument so
provides."

The apex Court in the said case was considering the principle relating to "subrogation". In the above
context, the apex Court held that when a letter of subrogation-cum-assignment is executed, the
assignment is interlinked with subrogation, and not being an assignment of a mere right to sue, will
be valid and enforceable. In the above case, the arguments that transfer was hit by Section 6(e) of
the Transfer of Property Act was negatived. The above case is thus, clearly distinguishable and does
not help the appellant in the facts of the present case.
Section 6(e) of the Transfer of Property Act came for consideration before the apex Court in (1972) 2
SCC 877 Union of India Vs. Sri Sarada Mills Ltd. The apex Court in the said case held that an
assignment of property is valid even though that property may be incapable of being recovered
without litigation. Following was laid down in paragraph 14:
"14. Section 6(e) of the Transfer of Property Act states that a mere right to sue cannot
be transferred. A bare right of action might be claims to damages for breach of
contract or claims to damages for tort. An assignment of a mere right of litigation is
bad. An assignment of property is valid even although that property may be incapable
of being recovered without litigation. The reason behind the rule is that a bare right
of action for damages is not assignable because the law will not recognise any
transaction which may savour of maintenance of champerty. It is only when there is
some interest in the subject matter that a transaction can be saved from the
imputation of maintenance. That interest must exist apart from the assignment and
to that extent must be independent of it."
In view of the foregoing discussions, we are of the considered opinion that transfers made in favour
of the respondents during the pendency of the land acquisition reference before the Additional
District Judge/District Judge was not hit by section 6(e) of the Transfer of Property Act. Transfer of
right to receive compensation consequent to reference proceedings was a right in a property i.e.
compensation on true market value of the property at the time of notification under section 4 and
cannot be held to be "mere right to sue" The transferees thus after transfer of the right to receive
compensation and other sums consequent to the reference proceedings, stepped into the shoes of
the original owners and were rightly substituted under Order 22 Rule 10 C.P.C. by the reference
Court. The respondents thus, were clearly entitled for the benefits of the order passed by the
reference Court. The submissions of the learned counsel for the appellant that the transferees
cannot be awarded or given any compensation, cannot be accepted.
Issue No. 4:
As noted above, in these appeals two judgments of the Additional District Judges are
under challenge. First set of appeals (being appeal No. 62 of 1999) has been filed
against the judgment and order dated 14.9.1998 of III Additional District Judge
arising out of land acquisition reference No. 205 of 1989 and second set of appeals
(First Appeal No. 81 of 1996 and First Appeal No. 82 of 1996) have been filed against
the judgment and order dated 6.11.1995 delivered by the District Judge, Bulandshahr
in Land Acquisition Reference No. 239 of 1989 and 213 of 1989. In both the above
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 26The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
sets of appeals, claimant as well as Food Corporation of India have placed reliance on
various documentary evidences including exemplars sale deeds. Food Corporation of
India relied on various sale deeds which can be divided in two categories. One
category of sale deeds related to true copy of the sale deeds attested by Public Notary
and another category of sale deeds were certified copy of the sale deeds. In Land
Acquisition Reference No. 205 of 1989, the Additional District Judge took the view
that filing of sale deeds in evidence is not sufficient unless seller or purchaser is
produced as witness to prove the sale deeds. Copies of the sale deeds filed by the
Food Corporation of India were held to be not admissible in evidence, which cannot
be made the basis for determining the market price of the land. In Land Acquisition
Reference No. 239 of 1989 and Land Acquisition Reference No. 213 of 1989, the Food
Corporation of India has also placed reliance on the sale deeds. The District Judge
accepted the sale deeds on record and while determining the market price of the land,
the sale deeds were considered and referred to. As noted above, both the Land
Acquisition References arose out of the same notification issued under sections 4 and
6 of the Land Acquisition Act. The sale deeds which were filed by the Food
Corporation of India consisted of certified copy of the sale deeds as well as true copy
of the sale deeds attested by the Public Notaries. Whether certified copy of the sale
deeds filed by the Food Corporation of India could be treated to be admissible in
evidence and relied for determining the market value of the land is a question to be
answered. Section 51A of the Land Acquisition Act was inserted in Land Acquisition
Act by Act No. 68 of 1984 w.e.f. 24.9.1984, which is to the following effect:
"51A Acceptance of certified copy as evidence - In any proceeding under this Act, a
certified copy of a document registered under the Registration Act, 1908 (16 of 1908),
including a copy given under Section 57 of that Act, may be accepted as evidence of
the transaction recorded in such document."
The apex Court had occasion to consider the issue regarding admissibility of certified copy of the
sale deed when no witnesses are produced to prove the sale deed in (2001) 3 SCC 530 Land
Acquisition Officer and Mandal Revenue Officer vs. V. Narasaiah. In the said case, before the
reference Court, the land owner had relied on certified copies of the sale deeds relating to other
land. The reference Court did not take into account those sale deeds on the ground that no body
connected with the transfer involved in those sale deeds had been examined as witness. The Division
Bench of the High Court took the view that those two sale deeds were required to have been
considered for fixing the land value of the acquired land. Against the judgment of the High Court
appeal was filed by the State where submission was raised on behalf of the State that High Court
ought not to have taken into consideration those documents as nobody connected with the
transaction had been examined. The apex Court relying on section 51A of the Land Acquisition Act,
repelled the submission and held that the documents can be accepted as evidence of the transaction,
whereas although mere accepting them as evidence does not mean that court was bound to consider
them as reliable evidence. It is useful to quote paragraphs 6,7,13,14 and 16 of the judgment:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 27The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
"6. Ex.A2 and Ex.A4 are the copies of sale-deed dated 15.11.1983 and 24.3.1984
respectively, which are said to be the instruments relating to small plots of land
situated in the vicinity of the acquired land. The reference court did not take into
account those two sale-deeds on the ground that nobody connected with the
transaction involved in those deeds had been examined as a witness. But the division
bench of the High Court expressed that the reference court should have taken into
consideration those two sale deeds also for fixing the land value of the acquired land.
The High Court took them into consideration and finally reached the conclusion that
the value of the acquired land could have been Rs.75,000/- per acre as on the date of
the notification issued under Section 4(1) of the L.A.Act.
7.Smt. K. Amreshwari, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant State contended that
the High Court ought not have taken into consideration any of those documents as
nobody connected with the transaction mentioned therein had been examined. On
the other hand Sri Vidya sagar, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that
Section 51A of the Act is intended to enable the Court to consider the transaction
evidenced by the sale deeds. That Section reads thus:
"51A Acceptance of certified copy as evidence - In any proceeding under this Act, a
certified copy of a document registered under the Registration Act, 1908 (16 of 1908),
including a copy given under Section 57 of that Act, may be accepted as evidence of
the transaction recorded in such document."
13. If the position regarding admissibility of the contents of a document which is a certified copy
falling within the purview of section 57(5) of the Registration Act was as adumbrated above, even
before the introduction of section 51A in the L.A.Act, could there be any legislative object in
incorporating the said new provision through Act 68 of 1984? It must be remembered that the state
has the burden to prove the market value of the lands acquired by it for which the state may have to
depend upon the prices of lands similarly situated which were transacted or sold in the recent past,
particularly those lands situated in the neighbouring areas. The practice had shown that for the state
officials it was a burden to trace out the persons connected with such transactions mentioned in the
sale-deeds and then to examine them in court for the purpose of proving such transactions. It was in
the wake of the aforesaid practical difficulties that the new Section 51A was introduced in the L.A.
Act. When the Section says that certified copy of a registered document "may be accepted as
evidence of the transaction recorded in such document" it enables the court to treat what is recorded
in the document, in respect of the transactions referred to therein, as evidence.
14.The words "may be accepted as evidence" in the Section indicate that there is no compulsion on
the court to accept such transaction as evidence, but it is open to the court to treat them as evidence.
Merely accepting them as evidence does not mean that the court is bound to treat them as reliable
evidence. What is sought to be achieved is that the transactions recorded in the documents may be
treated as evidence, just like any other evidence, and it is for the court to weigh all the pros and cons
to decide whether such transaction can be relied on for understanding the real price of the land
concerned.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 28The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
16. In the case of Section 51A of the LA Act also the position cannot be different, as it is open to the
court to act on the documents regarding the transaction recorded in such documents. However, this
will not prevent any party who supports or opposes the said document or the transaction recorded
therein to adduce other evidence to substantiate their stand regarding such transactions. But it is
not possible to hold that even after the introduction of section 51A the position would remain the
same as before."
Similar view has been reiterated by the apex Court in Church of South India Trust Association Vs.
Land Acquisition Officer & Tehsildar (2006) 9 SCC 676. Following was laid down by the apex court
in paragraphs 6 to 9:
"6. The High Court observed that only Ext. A-8 and Ext. X-1 had been duly proved by
examining a person connected with the transaction recorded in those documents. In
this view of the matter, the High Court did not consider it necessary to consider the
remaining documents. Thus, the exhibits produced by the appellant Trust as evidence
before the Reference Court, were not looked into and kept out of consideration by the
High Court. Mr. Shanti Bhushan, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant
Trust submitted that the High Court took this view having regard to the earlier
judgments of this Court which had considered the legal implications of Section 51-A
of the Act which came into force by way of amendment to the Act in the year 1984. He
drew our attention to the judgment of this Court in Land Acquisition Officer &
Mandal Revenue Officere V. Narasaiah and a later Constitution Bench decision of this
Court in Cement Corpn. Of India Ltd. Vs. Purya. Having regard to the law laid down
by this Court in the aforesaid decisions, it could not be disputed before us by the
parties that registered sale deeds of exemplars must be admitted in evidence and
considered by the Court in accordance with the principles laid down in the aforesaid
judgments.
7.Thus, we must conclude that evidence which was admissible under Section 51-A of
the Act was kept out of consideration by the High Court and this has vitiated the
judgment of the High Court.
8.We do not wish to refer to the facts of the case and the evidence on record lest it
may prejudice the case of the parties because we propose to remit the matter to the
High Court for a fresh consideration of the material on record in the light of the
decisions of this Court. We should not be understood to have expressed any opinion
on the merit of the matter and it will be open for the High Court to consider the
evidence on record in accordance with law.
9.In the result, the impugned judgment and order of the High Court is set aside and
the matter remitted to the High Court for fresh consideration of the appeals and the
cross-objections in accordance with law. Since the matter has been considerably
delayed, we request the High Court to dispose of the appeals and cross-objections as
early as possible."

In view of the above discussion, it is clear that certified copy of the sale deed is admissible in
evidence and the reference court was required to consider the sale deeds even though no witnesses
was produced to prove the sale deeds. As noted above, in Land Acquisition Reference No. 205 of
1989, certified copy of the sale deeds filed by Food Corporation of India were not treated to be
evidence and were not considered by the reference Court while determining the market value of the
land. The reference court although did not take into consideration certified copy of the sale deed but
has taken into consideration other documentary evidence including the judgment of reference Court
dated 6.11.1995 in Land Acquisition Reference No. 239 of 1989 in which Land Acquisition Reference
proceedings under section 18 the market value of the land acquired by the same notification was
determined. The appeals have been filed against both the judgments dated 6.11.1995 and 14.9.1998
in Land Acquisition References. The judgment dated 14.9.1998 relies on the judgment of the
reference court dated 6.11.1995. Normally when admissible documentary evidence i.e. certified copy
of the sale deed has not been considered by the reference Court, the matter ought to be remitted to
the reference court for considering the certified copy of the sale deeds and then determine the
market value of the land but in these two sets of appeals, it is not necessary to remit the matter to
the reference court for determining the market value of the sale deed due to following reasons:
(i)In Land Acquisition Reference No. 239 of 1989 with 213 of 1989, the Food
Corporation of India has placed reliance on the sale deeds which were also relied in
Land Acquisition Reference No. 205 of 1989. The District Judge while deciding the
Land Acquisition Reference No. 239 of 1989 had examined the oral as well as
documentary evidence including the sale deeds for determining the market value of
the land. Certified copy of the sale deeds relied by the Food Corporation of India as
exemplar for determining the market value were considered by the District Judge in
his judgment dated 6.11.1995 and the submissions of claimants were noticed by the
District Judge in following words:
"2) Sale deeds of higher valuation were available to the S.L.A.O. At serial No. 2 worth
Rs. 4,00,000/- per bigha as also discussed by the S.L.A.O. In his award. This sale
deed was executed much earlier than the date of notification. The sale deed filed by
the O.P. Related to the vicinity near the Kali Nadi situated at 5 kms away from the
land in question and on one side of the city."
(ii)Thus, the District Judge in his judgment dated 6.11.1995 has considered the exemplars relied by
the Food Corporation of India and the judgment dated 6.11.1995 having been relied by the
Additional District Judge in his judgment dated 14.9.1998, non consideration of the sale deeds in
subsequent judgment dated 14.9.1998 is of no substantial consequence.
In view of the foregoing discussions, we are thus of the view that certified copy of the sale deeds
relied by the Food Corporation of India were admissible in evidence which were taken into
consideration by the learned District Judge while deciding the Land Acquisition Reference No. 239
of 1989 and were held not to be appropriate for determining the market price of the acquired land.
The subsequent judgment dated 14.9.1998 although does not take into consideration certified copy
of the sale deeds but has placed reliance on the earlier judgment of the District Judge dated
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 30The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
6.11.1995. Non consideration of the sale deeds in subsequent judgment dated 14.9.1998 thus, is of
not much consequence so as to necessitate remitting the matter to reference Court for deciding
afresh. The issue is decided accordingly.
Issue No. 5:
The next issued to be considered is as to whether the Additional District Judge
committed any error in relying the earlier judgment dated 6.11.1995 passed in Land
Acquisition Reference No. 205 of 1989 making an award of Rs. 200/- per square
yard, is a question to be examined. At the time when judgment dated 14.9.1998 was
delivered, the judgment and order dated 6.11.1995 was under challenge before this
Court in First Appeal. However, the judgment and order dated 6.11.1995 of the
reference court was not stayed by the High Court rather certain interim orders were
passed regarding part payment of the compensation enhanced by the reference court.
The Apex court had occasion to consider whether the judgment determining the
market value of the land is relevant for determining the market value of a land in
subsequent proceedings relating to land in the vicinity in (1992) 4 SCC 400 Pal Singh
and others Vs. Union Territory of Chandigarh. Land Acquisition Reference was
decided by the Additional District Judge. The appeals were filed against the judgment
of the reference court. When the first appeal came for hearing, both the parties
submitted before the High Court that the issue is covered by the decision in earlier
appeal decided by the High Court. Following the earlier judgments, the appeals were
decided. The appeal was filed in the apex Court. The apex Court in the above case
held that the judgment determining the market value of a land in vicinity even
though not inter-parties could be admitted in evidence. Following was laid down in
paragraph 5:
"5. No doubt, a judgment of a court in a land acquisition case determining the market
value of a land in the vicinity of the acquired lands, even though not interparties,
could be admitted in evidence either as an instance or one from which the market
value of the acquired land could be deduced or inferred as has been held by the
Calcutta High Court in H.K. Mallick's case (supra) based on the authority of the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Secretary of State v. Indian General Steam
Navigation and Railway Co. I.LR. 36 Cal. 967, where the Judicial Committee did
refuse to interfere with High Court judgment in a land acquisition case based on
previous awards, holding that no question of principle was involved in it. But what
cannot be overlooked is, that for a judgment relating to value of land to be admitted
in evidence either as an instance or as one from which the market value of the
acquired land could be inferred or deduced, must have been a previous judgment of
Court and as an instance, it must have been proved by the person relying upon such
judgment by adducing evidence aliunde that due regard being given to all attendant
facts and circumstances, it could furnish the basis for determining the market value
of the acquired land. In the cases on hand, the petitioners who are claimants claiming
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 31The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
enhanced compensation for their acquired land have not produced the judgment of
the High Court on which they propose to rely for finding the market value of their
acquired lands as evidence in their cases, in that they could not have done so for the
reason that it was not a judgment then available to them as a previous judgment
relating to market value of land in the vicinity. Much less, is there any evidence
aliunde adduced by them in the cases on hand to show that due regard being given to
all attendant facts and circumstances, it could form the basis for determining the
market value of their acquired lands. Hence, there is no. justification for us to act
upon a subsequent judgment of the High Court, cited before us from a Law Report, to
enhance the market value of the acquired lands of the petitioners merely because it
was claimed on their behalf that the market value of the lands concerned therein
could become evidence for determining the market value of the lands concerned in
the appeals respecting which the present Special Leave Petitions are filed. Moreover,
when judgment is rendered by a Court determining the market value of lands
acquired under the Act, by agreement of parties, such judgment becomes final and it
would not be open to any of the parties thereto to appeal against that judgment.
Hence, these Special Leave Petitions are liable to be dismissed."
Thus the judgment of the District Judge dated 6.11.1995 which related to the land acquired by same
notification under sections 4 and 6 out of which Land Acquisition Reference No. 205 of 1989 arose
was relevant while determining the Land Acquisition Reference No. 205 of 1989. Hence, the
judgment dated 14.9.1998 relying on the earlier judgment of the District Judge dated 6.11.1995
cannot be faulted. The issue is decided accordingly.
Issue No. 6:
Next issue to be considered is as to whether determination of Rs. 200/- per square
yard by the judgment and order dated 6.11.1995 of the District Judge was based on
correct appreciation of material on record. The appeal Nos. 81 and 82 of 1996 have
been filed against the judgment dated 6.11.1995. The judgment dated 6.11.1995 arose
out of Land Acquisition Reference No. 239 and 213 of 1989. Both the parties led
documentary and oral evidences. Claimants have placed reliance on three earlier
judgments dated 31.5.1994 in Land Acquisition Reference No. 148 of 1992, judgment
dated 31.5.1995 in Land Acquisition Reference No. 152 of 1995 and judgment dated
19.5.1992 in Land Acquisition Reference No. 256 of 1987. Food Corporation of India
had filed certified copy of ten exemplars sale deeds. Claimants have examined Shanti
Swaroop, Natthu Singh as witness in Land Acquisition Reference No. 239 of 1989,
and Pratham Kumar and Atul Kumar in Land Acquisition Reference No. 213 of 1989.
Food Corporation of India examined Mahabir (SLAO Amin), Y.P. Dewan, District
Manager of Food Corporation of India, S.K. Sharma, Assistant Manager of Food
Corporation of India and Mahendra Pal Sharma Assistant Grade-2 and Nityanand
Swaroop. Learned District Judge while determining the market value of the land has
considered both oral and documentary evidence. It was held by the learned District
Judge that the acquired land is situated in the municipal limits of the district
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 32The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
Bulandshahr. In east after railway line there was bungalow of the District Judge, Civil
Court campus, on the west of the land Chandpur road was passing. Learned District
Judge made following observations:
"It is further argued that no doubt increase of value by use of the acquired land,
cannot be looked into, but future potentiality and development cannot be overlooked.
Posh locality known as Hari Enclave, Avas Vikas Colony, Yamunapuram etc have
been established nearby the acquired land"
The District Judge after considering the submissions of the witness on record has held that the
acquired land has both residential and commercial potentiality. The learned District Judge made
following observations regarding market value of the land:
"Taking into consideration the above citations, and the facts and circumstances of the
case it is apparent that the acquired land had both residential and commercial
potentiality. It is also apparent from the original record available before the S.L.A.O.
that it is immaterial whether the land was used for agricultural purposes prior to the
notification. Thus, the materials available on the record may be relied upon by this
Court and may be referred to by the claimants. A bare perusal of the original record
would show that the compensation awarded by the S.L.A.O. is inadequate and burden
lies upon the opposite party to prove that adequate compensation has been paid.
Railway line has not / shall not diminish the value of the land as it was most suitable
for loading and unloading being situated near the railway station.
Learned Counsel for the claimants has argued that the market value of the land was
above Rs. 500/- per sq. yard at the time of notification. He referred to statements of
PW1 and PW 2 stating market value of the acquired land to be Rs. 500/- per sq. yard.
He also referred to statements of Dws 1 to 5 who showed their ignorance about
market value of the acquired land to be Rs. 500/- per sq. yard at the time of
notification. It is admitted fact that the acquired land is situated near Panniji sugar
mill on Chandpur road. Village Chandpur is situated about 1 ½ Kms. from the
acquired land. Thus, the statements of PW1 and PW2 are uncontroverted that the
prevailing market rate of the acquired land was more than Rs. 500/- per sq. yard.
According to the learned counsel for the claimants, this is the direct evidence and
cannot be ignored."
During the course of arguments, learned counsel for the appellants have not assailed the findings of
the District Judge in so far as appreciation of evidence on record is considered. The challenge as
noted above, was confined to the submission that Additional District Judge while delivering the
judgment dated 14.9.1998 ignored the certified copy of the sale deeds on the ground that they have
not been proved by the evidence of seller or purchasers. The judgment of the District Judge dated
6.11.1995 determining the market value of the land as Rs. 200/- per square yard is based on
appreciation of evidence on record including consideration of exemplar and cannot be faulted. We
thus uphold the determination of the market value of the land as Rs. 200/- per square yard as in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 33The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
Land Acquisition Reference No. 239 and 213 of 1989.
Issue No. 7:
Now comes the issue as to whether there was sufficient material on record in Land
Acquisition Reference No. 205 of 1989 for determination of compensation at the rate
of Rs. 175/- per square yard. In Land Acquisition Reference No. 205 of 1989, the
claimants relied on three earlier judgments of the reference court and had examined
Har Prasad, Nityanand Swaroop and Dhakkan as their witnesses. Food Corporation
of India had relied on ten exemplars sale deeds and produced witnesses Mahabir (
SLAO Amin), Y.P. Dewan, District Manager of Food Corporation of India, S.K.
Sharma, Assistant Manager of Food Corporation of India and Mahendra Pal Sharma
Assistant Grade-2. The District Judge has considered the statements of witnesses of
the claimants as well as of the Food Corporation of India. Issue no. 1 was framed as to
what amount of compensation is entitled to be received by the claimants. Certified
copy of the sale deeds dated 3.6.1969, 28.7.1969, 15.9.1969 and 22.9.1969 were filed
by the Food Corporation of India. Rest of the sale deeds attested by the Public Notary
were filed. The claimants had relied on the judgment dated 6.11.1995 in Land
Acquisition Reference No. 239 of 1989 by which the District Judge has determined
the market value of the land as Rs. 200/- per square yard. As noted above, the Land
Acquisition Reference No. 239 of 1989 was relating to the same land which was
acquired by the same notification giving rise to Land Acquisition Reference no. 205
of 1989. The Additional District Judge has placed reliance on the judgment dated
6.11.1995. The other two judgments relied by the claimants were held not to be
relevant. It was categorically held by the Additional District Judge that claimants in
Land Acquisition Reference no. 205 of 1989 are also entitled for same amount of
market value of the land as determined in Land Acquisition Reference no. 239 of
1989, both lands is being covered by the same notification. It was held by the District
Judge that the acquired land was situated within the municipal limits of
Bulandshahr. Near the acquired land there is dense Abadi and main commercial
center namely; Kala Aam, Civil court, Central School, Narreni ground , Government
bus stand , railway station which places could be reached within two minutes on foot
from the acquired land. Acquired land is situated on Pakka road, electricity supply,
telecommunication is available to the acquired land. The acquired land is suitable for
residential colony. Evidence was also led that acquired land could have been sold at
the rate of Rs. 500/- per square yard. Learned District Judge considering the
situation of the land and after considering the fact that near the acquired land there
was teachers colony, judges compound, had determined the market value of the land.
The learned Additional District Judge however, decided to reduce the value by 12.5%
from the earlier award and has determined the value as Rs. 175/- per square yard. No
attempts have been made by learned counsel for the appellant to challenge the
findings recorded by the learned Additional District Judge in appreciating the
evidence on record except that Additional District Judge committed error in not
referring to certified copy of the sale deeds which were filed by the Food Corporation
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/99540598/ 34The Distt. Manager, Food Corporation Of ... vs Shri Kailash Chand & Others on 12 December, 2013
of India as exemplars. We are thus, of the view that Additional District Judge has
rightly determined the market value of the land as Rs. 175/- per square yard.
In view of the foregoing discussions, we are of the view that no ground has been made
out to interfere in the judgments of the reference Court dated 6.11.1995 and 14.9.1998
and all the appeals filed against the said judgments deserve to be dismissed.
Consequently all the appeals are dismissed.
Parties shall bear their own costs.
