CIVIL ORIGINAL JURISDICTION
WRIT PETITION (CIVIL) NO.961 OF 2018
SKILL LOTTO SOLUTIONS PVT. LTD. ...PETITIONER
VERSUS
UNION OF INDIA & ORS. ...RESPONDENTS
J U D G M E N T
ASHOK BHUSHAN, J.
The petitioner, an authorized agent, for sale and distribution of lotteries organized by State of
Punjab has filed this writ petition impugning the definition of goods under Section 2(52) of Central
Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 and consequential notifications to the extent it levies tax on
lotteries. The petitioner seeks declaration that the levy of tax on lottery is discriminatory and
violative of Articles 14, 19(1)(g), 301 and 304 of the Constitution of India.
2. We need to notice certain background facts which has given rise to this writ petition.
2.1 The Parliament enacted the Lotteries (Regulation) Act, 1998 to regulate the lotteries and to
provide for matters connected therewith and incidental thereto. Section 2(b) of the Act defines
lottery which provides that “lottery” means a scheme, in whatever form and by whatever name
called, for distribution of prizes by lot or chance to those persons participating in the chances of a
prize by purchasing tickets. Section 4 provides that a State Government may organise, conduct or
promote the lottery subject to conditions enumerate therein. Different States have been organizing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 1Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
and conducting lotteries in accordance with the aforesaid Act. It is to be noted that prior to
parliamentary enactment for regulating the lotteries, different States have enacted legislation
regulating the lotteries which were the legislations even prior to the enforcement of the
Constitution, levying tax on the sale of lottery tickets. Reference is made to Bengal Finance Sales Tax
Act, 1941 and Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939. Another Statute to be noticed is Bombay
Lotteries (Control and Tax) and Prize Competitions (Tax) Act, 1958.
2.2 There has been a series of litigation regarding taxability of lottery tickets and this Court had
occasion to deliver several judgments on the subject which we shall notice hereinafter. Service tax
was levied on lottery tickets by Finance Act, 1994. A Circular dated 14/21.2.2017 was also issued
providing for mode of determination of the amount of service tax. Rules were also framed namely
Lotteries (Regulation) Rules, 2010 by the Central Government containing a set of rules for
regulation of the lotteries organized by the States.
2.3 By Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016, Article 246A was inserted in
the Constitution containing special provisions with respect to Goods and Services Tax. Article 269A
and Article 279A were also inserted by same constitutional amendment. Article 279A provided for
constitution of Goods and Services Tax Council. The Parliament enacted the Central Goods and
Services Tax Act, 2017 (Act No.12 of 2017) to make provisions for levy and collection of tax on
intra-State supply of goods or services or both by the Central Government and for matters
connected therewith or incidental thereto. The Act came into force w.e.f. 12.04.2017. The Parliament
also enacted the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (Act No.13 of 2017), the Union
Territory Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (Act No.14 of 2017) and the Goods and Services Tax
(compensation to States) Act, 2017 (Act No.15 of 2017). 2.4 Under Section 2(52) of Central Goods
and Services Tax Act, 2017, the term “goods” has been defined which provides that “goods” means
every kind of movable property other than money and securities but includes actionable
claim……………. Chapter III of the Act provides for levy and collection of tax. Section 15 deals with
value of taxable supply. After the enactment of Act No.12 of 2017, Notification was issued by
Government of India dated 28.06.2017 in exercise of power conferred by sub-section (1) of Section 9
notifying the rate of the integrated tax.
By the notification dated 28.06.2017 with
regard to lottery run by the State
Government, value of supply of lottery was deemed to be 100/112 of the face value of the ticket or
the prize as notified in the official gazette of the organising State, whichever is higher. With regard
to lotteries authorised by the State Government value of supply of lottery was deemed to be
100/128.
2.5 The writ petitioner, an authorised agent for the state of Punjab for sale and distribution of
lotteries organised by State of Punjab aggrieved by the provisions of Act No.12 of 2017 as well as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 2Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
notifications issued therein filed the present writ petition praying for following reliefs:-
“a) By appropriate writ, order or direction, quash and set aside the definition of 'Goods' under
Section 2(52) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 [Annexure P-18 (Pg.141 to 143)],
Impugned Notifications 01/2017 [Annexure P-19 (Pg.144 to 148)], Integrated Tax (Rate), 01/201
[Annexure P-20 (Pg. 149 to 154)], and the State rate Notifications of the Respondent State of Punjab
[Annexure P-21(Pg.155 to 157)] to the extent it levies tax on Lottery by declaring the same to be
discriminatory and violative of Article 49, (19)(1)(g), 301, 304 of the Constitution of India and of the
CGST, SGST and IGST Act.
b) In the Alternative, by appropriate writ, order or direction quash and set aside the impugned
Notifications 01/2017 Integrated Tax (Rate) 01/2017 and the State rate Notification of the
Respondent State of Punjab to the extent it levies tax on the face value of the lottery ticket without
abating the prize money Component of the lottery ticket when the said amount never forms part of
the income of the Petitioner or the lottery trade.
c) In the Alternative, by appropriate writ, order or direction quash and set aside the Impugned
Notifications 01/2017 Integrated Tax (Rate) 01/2017 and the State rate Notification of the

lottery ticket and declare that the Respondents can levy an uniform rate of 12% Tax on Lottery
irrespective of place where it is being sold, and after adjusting the prize money component from the
face value of lottery tickets.”
3. We have heard Shri Ravindra Shrivastava, learned senior counsel for the petitioner and Shri
Vikramjit Banerjee, learned Additional Solicitor General for the Union of India. We have also heard
Shri C.A. Sundaram, learned senior counsel for the intervenor.
4. Shri Shrivastava submits that lottery is not a goods and under the Central Goods and Services Tax
Act, 2017, GST is levied only on goods, hence levy of GST on lottery is ultra vires to the Constitution.
It is further submitted that the Constitution Article 366 sub-article (12) define goods to include all
materials, commodities and articles. The definition in the Constitution exclude actionable claims
since it only refers to materials, commodities and articles. The definition of goods given in Section
2(52) of Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (hereinafter referred to as “Act, 2017”) is
unconstitutional. It is further submitted that Constitution Bench of this Court in Sunrise Associates
Vs. Govt. of NCT of Delhi and Ors., (2006) 5 SCC 603 has categorically held that lottery is not a
good. When Constitution Bench has held that lottery is not a good, the provisions of Act, 2017
treating the lottery as goods is contrary to the judgement of Constitution Bench in Sunrise
Associates (supra). The lottery is not an actionable claim as is now sought to be included in the
definition of goods given in Section 2(52). The provisions of Act, 2017 are self-contradictory in as
much as the definition of actionable claim is as per definition of Transfer of Property Act, which is
only the claim and not the goods. Further, under the definition of goods, actionable claims have
been included as goods under Section 2(52). It is further submitted that GST is being levied on the
face value of the lottery tickets which is impermissible since the face value of the tickets also
includes prize money to be reimbursed to the winners of the lottery tickets. Learned senior Counsel
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 3Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
submits that meaning of goods as occurring in the Constitution of India has to be taken in its legal
sense. The definition of goods as occurring in Sale of Goods Act, 1930 clearly excludes actionable
claims from the definition of goods, which definition has been held to be definition of goods under
the Constitution by this Court in State of Madras Vs. Gannon Dunkerley & Co., (Madras) Ltd.,
(1959) SCR
329. The attempt of including the actionable claim within the meaning of goods seems to be
deliberate attempt to make the lottery fall within the scope of GST which would render the
definition of goods contrary to the meaning ascribed to it by the Constitution of India as held by
Gannon Dunkerley (supra). The words defined in the Constitution of India will have to be ascribed
their legal meaning and not the popular meaning.
5. Shri Shrivastava further submits that the Parliament does not enjoy an absolute power to make an
inclusive definition of something to be taxed which is not taxable otherwise. There is no absolute
power with the legislature to define something. If such definition has no rationale, such artificial
definition cannot be treated only for the purpose of assuming taxation power. Shri Shrivastava
further submits that taxing actionable claim only is discriminatory since all actionable claims are
not being taxed. Shri Shrivastava submits that according to Schedule III to the Act, 2017 under Item
No.6 actionable claims other than lottery, betting and gambling have been treated neither as supply
of goods nor supply of services. There is a clear hostile discrimination in taxing only lottery, betting
and gambling whereas all other actionable claims have been left out of the taxing net. Shri
Shrivastava has further submitted that the observations made in the judgment of Constitution
Bench in Sunrise Associates (supra) that lotteries are actionable claims are only obiter dicta and
cannot be treated to be ratio of the judgment.
6. Shri Vikramjit Banerjee, learned Additional Solicitor General refuting the submissions of learned
senior counsel for the petitioner at the very outset submits that the writ petition filed by the writ
petitioner under Article 32 is not maintainable. It is submitted that lottery is “res extra
commercium” and no right under Article 19(1)(g) and Article 301 can be claimed by the petitioner
with regard to lottery. The transaction of lottery tickets cannot be raised to the status of trade,
commerce or intercourse. There is no right with the petitioner which can be enforced by writ
petition filed under article 32 of the Constitution, hence, the writ petition being not maintainable
deserves to be dismissed. Mr. Banerjee further submits that the laws relating to economic activity
need to be viewed with greater latitude than laws touching civil rights. He further submits that
courts are loath to interfere with taxing policies of the States. The fact of not levying tax on other
actionable claims apart from lottery, betting and gambling cannot be said to be discriminatory. It is
submitted that Constitution Bench of this court in Sunrise Associates (supra) has held that an
actionable claim is a movable property and goods in the wider sense. The definition of goods given
in Section 2(52) of Act 2017 is in accord with the Constitution Bench judgment of this court in
Sunrise Associates (supra) and the argument that definition of goods given in Section 2(52) is
contrary to above Constitution Bench judgment in Sunrise Associates (supra) is misplaced. The
definition of goods given under Article 366(12) of the Constitution is an inclusive definition. Article
366(12A) defines goods and services tax to mean tax on supply of goods or services or both except
taxes on the supply of alcoholic liquor for human consumption. Lottery having been judicially held
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 4Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
to be an actionable claim is covered within the meaning of term goods under section 2(52). The
Union Parliament has the competence to levy GST on lotteries under article 246A of the
Constitution. Under Article 279A the GST Council has approved the levy of GST on lottery tickets,
hence, the inclusion of actionable claims in the definition of goods under section 2(52) is in keeping
with the legislative and taxing policy. It is well settled that courts would not review the wisdom or
advisability or expediency of a tax. The levy on face value is authorised by section 15(1) read with
section 15(5) of the Act, 2017 and Rule 31(A) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Rules, 2017. The
levy of 28% tax on face value is neither discriminatory nor beyond the taxing policy/powers of the
State.
7. Shri Banerjee further submits that during pendency of the writ petition, Rule 31A has been
amended vide notification dated 02.03.2020 merging earlier two separate rates, i.e., regarding value
of supply of lottery run by the State Government, which was earlier 100/112 and value of supply of
lottery authorised by the State Government, which was 100/128 has been made uniform and by
virtue of Rule 31A sub- rule(2), value of supply of lottery is one and the same, i.e., 100/128 of the
face value of the ticket or prize as notified by the organising State, whichever is higher. He submits
that in view of the above amendment dated 02.03.2020, which is not challenged in the present writ
petition, the argument on the ground of discrimination in the rate of tax is no longer available to the
petitioner. Shri Banerjee further submits that judgment of this Court in State of Madras Vs. Gannon
Dunkerley (supra) relied by learned senior counsel for the petitioner is not attracted in the facts of
the present case. It is submitted that the above decision dealt with the definition of term “sale” and
was not concerned with the interpretation of “goods”.
8. Shri Sundaram appearing for the intervenor submits that the Constitution permits tax on goods
and actionable claims being not taxed under the Constitution, the Parliament cannot have the power
of taxing lottery. The taxing power of legislature is traceable to the Constitution alone. It is not open
to the legislature to enlarge its taxing power. The word “goods” is not a new word and is a concept
well known in the Constitution. Legislature cannot tax something which is constitutionally not
goods. The Act, 2017 cannot include something that was not part of the definition as provided for in
the Constitution. The definition of goods under the GST Act would necessarily have to be guided by
the definition of goods given under the Constitution. Shri Sundaram further submits that in any
event, the prize money in a lottery deducted from a lottery claim ought not to be taxed at all and the
tax, if at all ought to be levied only on the invoice value, i.e., the transaction value of the lottery ticket
or the lottery scheme after deducting the prize money. The lottery ticket has a zero value and is only
a chance, which cannot be taxed. Shri Sundaram submits that lottery ticket is not even an actionable
claim but only a chance, which is treated as an actionable claim by ratio of Constitution Bench
judgment in Sunrise Associates (supra), which will not be a good within the meaning of Article
366(12) of the Constitution. He submits that since it is not a good under the Constitution, Union and
the States had no right to tax. A Statute cannot bring in a definition something as good, which
Constitution itself excludes. Exclusion of all actionable claims from levy of GST except three, i.e.,
lottery, betting and gambling is nothing but hostile discrimination. Shri Sundaram submits that
when the lottery is being permitted by the States, it is a commercial activity. When the State itself
organise a lottery, it is not pernicious. No reason is forthcoming as to why only three actionable
claims are taxed leaving all others out of tax net.

9. Shri Ravindra Shrivastava in his rejoinder submits that he is not claiming any violation of right
under Article 19(1)(g) or Article 301. He submits that writ petition is fully maintainable under
Article 32 of the Constitution. A Parliamentary enactment on ground of violation of Article 14 is
sought to be challenged in the writ petition, which writ petition is fully maintainable. Shri
Shrivastava questions the legislative competence of Parliament to tax lottery as goods. Shri
Shrivastava submits that he has placed reliance on the principle, which has been laid down by this
Court in Gannon Dunkerley (supra). This court in Gannon Dunkerley (supra) laid down that
definition of goods has to be taken as it is meant under the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, which definition
is also to be taken for the purposes of Article 366(12) of the Constitution. Goods has to be
interpreted in its legal sense. Goods cannot be defined in an artificial manner as has been done by
the Parliament in Section 2(52). Shri Shrivastava submits that inclusive definition cannot be
expansive and unrealistic. He submits that there is no similarity in goods and actionable claims.
There cannot be artificial expansion of definition of goods. He submits that lottery acquires property
only when prize is declared. A ticket is only a chance and GST is levied on every sale of lottery ticket,
which is not permissible since it is not an actionable claim.
10. He reiterated his challenge on the ground of hostile discrimination with regard to only three
categories of actionable claims, i.e., lottery, betting and gambling whereas all other actionable
claims are not being taxed under Act, 2017. He submits that taxing only three items has no nexus
with the object sought to be achieved. No rationale has been provided by the respondent. If
actionable claim is a homogeneous clause, why only three have been picked out. Lottery is not
something pernicious. Relying on earlier circular dated 14.02.2017, Shri Shrivastava submits that
prize money has to be excluded from face value. Shri Shrivastava further submits that lottery is held
all across the world and in other countries, GST is levied by excluding the prize money. Shri
Shrivastava has lastly submitted that notification, which has been issued during pendency of the
writ petition now providing a uniform rate of lotteries organised by the States or authorised by the
State having not been challenged in this writ petition, hence, petitioner reserve its right to challenge
the notification dated 21.02.2020/02.03.2020 separately in appropriate proceedings.
11. We have considered the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the
records.
12. From the submissions of the learned counsel for the parties and materials on the record,
following are the questions which arise for consideration in this writ petition:-
(I) Whether the writ petition is not maintainable under Article 32 of the Constitution
of India since the writ petition relates to lottery, which is res extra commercium and
the petitioner cannot claim protection under Article 19(1)(g)?
(II) Whether the inclusion of actionable claim in the definition of goods as given in
Section 2(52) of Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 is contrary to the legal
meaning of goods and unconstitutional?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 6Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
(III) Whether the Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in Sunrise Associates
(supra) in paragraphs 33, 40, 43 and 48 of the judgment has laid down as the
proposition of law that lottery is an actionable claim or the observations made in the
judgment were only an obiter dicta and not declaration of law?
(IV) Whether exclusion of lottery, betting and gambling from Item No.6 Schedule III
of Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 is hostile discrimination and violative of
Article 14 of the Constitution of India?
(V) Whether while determining the face value of the lottery tickets for levy of GST,
prize money is to be excluded for purposes of levy of GST?
Question No. I
13. Learned Additional Solicitor General submits that petitioner, who is an authorised agent on
behalf of the State of Punjab for the lotteries organised by the State of Punjab cannot complain
violation of Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution and lottery being a res extra commercium, the writ
petition cannot be entertained. He submits that right to practice any profession or to carry on any
occupation, trade or business does not extend to practicing a profession or carrying on an
occupation, trade or business which is inherently vicious and pernicious. Shri Ravindra Shrivastava,
learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that he is not claiming any violation of
right under Article 19(1)(g) in the writ petition. In view of this submission of the learned senior
counsel for the petitioner, we need not consider the writ petition with reference to violation of
Article 19(1)(g).
14. Article 32 confers a right to move to Supreme Court for enforcement of the right conferred by the
Part III, which is guaranteed by sub-article (1) of Article 32 of the Constitution. Article 32 is an
important and integral part of the basic structure of the Constitution. Article 32 is meant to ensure
observance of rule of law. Article 32 provides for the enforcement of the fundamental rights, which
is most potent weapon. In the Constituent Assembly Debates, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar speaking about
this Article made following statement:-
“If I was asked to name any particular Article in the Constitution as most
important…………………… an Article without which the Constitution would be nullity –
I could not refer, to any other Article except this one. It is the very soul of the
constitution and the very heart of it.”
15. By this petition, the petitioner has challenged the provisions of Central Goods and Services Tax
Act, 2017 insofar as it imposes tax on the lottery. The grounds of challenge include violation of
Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The levy of GST has been attacked as discriminatory. It is also
submitted that there is a hostile discrimination in taxing only lottery, betting and gambling whereas
leaving all other actionable claims from the taxing net as is evident by entry 6 of Schedule III of Act,
2017.

16. The writ petition alleging the violation of Article 14 specially with respect to a parliamentary Act
can very well be entertained under Article 32. We may also notice that with regard to the matter of
lottery itself, this Court had entertained a writ petition earlier under Article 32. Reference is made to
judgment of this Court in H. Anraj and Ors. Vs. State of Maharashtra, (1984) 2 SCC 292 where the
writ petitioner, who were agents for the sale of tickets for the lottery filed a writ petition questioning
the ban imposed on the sale of lottery tickets within the State of Maharashtra. Even judgment of this
Court in H. Anraj Vs. Government of Tamil Nadu, (1986) 1 SCC 414 was also a writ petition, which
was heard alongwith a civil appeal questioning the leviability of the sales tax by the State Legislature
on the sale of lottery tickets.
17. We are, thus, of the considered opinion that on the grounds, which have been raised in the writ
petition, the writ petition cannot be said to be not maintainable under Article 32 and the
preliminary objection made by the learned ASG that the writ petition cannot be entertained under
Article 32 and is overruled.
Question Nos. II and III
18. Both the above questions being inter−related are taken together. The question to be considered
is as to what is the legal meaning of goods and whether actionable claim can also be a part of goods.
We need to first notice as to what is the concept of goods.
19. The Sale of Goods Act, 1930 defines goods in Section 2(7) in following words:
Section 2. Definitions. In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject
or context,— .....
(7)"goods" means every kind of movable property other than actionable claims and
money; and includes stock and shares, growing crops, grass, and things attached to
or forming part of the land which are agreed to be severed before sale or under the
contract of sale;”
20. Section 311(2) of the Government of India Act, 1935 which has been referred by this Court as
Constitution Act defines the goods as including all materials, commodities and articles. Entry 48 in
List II of Seventh Schedule of the Government of India Act, 1935 was “Taxes on the Sale of Goods”.
Prior to the enforcement of the Constitution of India goods were defined in different provincial
legislations. Article 366 of the Constitution of India contains heading 'definition'. Article 366 sub−
clause (12) defines goods. Article 366 sub−clause (12) is as follows:
"In this Constitution, unless the context otherwise requires, the following expression
has, the meaning hereby respectively assigned to them, that is to say (12)goods
includes all materials, commodities, and articles;”
21. Another expression which we may need to notice is “actionable claim”. Section 3
of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 which is interpretation clause defines the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 8Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
actionable claim in following words:
“actionable claim" means a claim to any debt, other than a debt secured by mortgage
of immovable property or by hypothecation or pledge of movable property, or to any
beneficial interest in movable property not in the possession, either actual or
constructive, of the claimant, which the Civil Courts recognise as affording grounds
for relief, whether such debt or beneficial interest be existent, accruing, conditional
or contingent;”
22. Now, we may notice the definition of goods in the Central Goods of Services Tax
Act, 2017 which definition is under challenge in the present writ petition. Section 2
sub−section (52) defines goods in the following words:
“Section 2(52)- “goods” means every kind of movable property other than money and
securities but includes actionable claim, growing crops, grass and things attached to
or forming part of the land which are agreed to be severed before supply or under a
contract of supply;”
23. Section 2(1) defines actionable claim in following words:
“Section 2(1) “actionable claim” shall have the same meaning as assigned to it in
section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882;”
24. The definition of goods as contained in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 in Section 2(7)
: “goods” means every kind of movable property other than actionable claims and
money; whereas definition of goods in Section 2(52) in the Act, 2017 while defining
goods as every kind of movable property other than money and securities “but
includes actionable claim”. We have noted above the various grounds of attack on the
inclusion of actionable claim in the definition of goods under Section 2(52) as raised
by the learned counsel for the petitioner. The first ground of attack of the learned
counsel for the petitioner is that expression goods is well known concept and is also
defined in the Constitution of India. The definition of goods as meant and understood
in the Constitution of India has to be adopted and not departed by the Legislature.
25. Shri Srivastava in his usual persuasive style submits that goods as defined in the
Sale of Goods Act, 1930 is the concept which has been held to be applicable with
respect to goods as understood in the Constitution of India also. The Act, 2017 could
not have taken any contrary definition and the contrary definition taken in Section
2(52) of Act, 2017 is unconstitutional and liable to be struck down. Sheet anchor of
the arguments of Shri Srivastava is the Constitution Bench Judgment in The State of
Madras vs. Gannon Dunkerley & Co.(Madras) Ltd., 1959 SCR
379. In the above case this Court had occasion to consider Entry 48 in List II in
Schedule VII of the Government of India Act, 1935 that is “Taxes on the sale of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 9Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
goods”. The Madras General Sales Tax Act, 1939 was amended by the Madras
General Sales Tax (Amendment) Act, 1947 introducing several new provisions.
Section 2(c) of the Act had defined “goods” as meaning “all kinds of movable property
other than actionable claims, stocks and shares and securities and as including all
materials, commodities and articles”. The provision was amended and so as to
include materials “used in the construction, fitting out, improvement or repair of
immovable property or in the fitting out, improvement or repair of movable
property”. The definition of “sale” in Section 2(h) was also enlarged so as to include
“a transfer of property in goods involved in the execution of a works contract”. The
assessing authorities included in the turnover of respondent the value of the
materials used in construction works which was contested by the respondent on the
ground that power of the Madras Legislature to impose a tax on sales under Entry 48
in List II in Schedule VII of the Government of India Act, does not extend to
imposing a tax on the value of materials used in works, as there is no transaction of
sale in respect of those goods, and the provisions introduced by the Madras General
Sales Tax(Amendment) Act, 1947, authorising the imposition of such tax are ultra
vires. The High Court deciding the question in favour of the respondent held that
expression sale of goods had the same meaning in Entry 48 which had in Sale of
Goods Act, 1930. The State of Madras filed an appeal in this Court. The question
which fell for consideration in the above case has been noticed in the judgment in the
following words:
"The sole question of
determination in this appeal is whether
the provisions of the Madras General Sales Tax Act are ultra vires, in so far as they
seek to impose a tax on the supply of materials in execution of works contract
treating it as a sale of goods by the contractor, and the answer to it must depend on
the meaning to be given to the words “sale of goods” in Entry 48 in List II of Schedule
VII to the Government of India Act, 1935....”
26. This Court laid down that the expression “sale of goods” in Entry 48 has to be
interpreted in its legal sense. Following observation was made at page 396:
"...We must accordingly hold that the expression “sale of goods” in Entry 48 cannot
be construed in its popular sense, and that it must be interpreted in its legal sense.
What its connotation in that sense is, must now be ascertained....”
27. This Court at page 404 held:
“...We think that the true legislative intent is that the expression “sale of goods” in
Entry 48 should bear the precise and definite meaning it has in law, and that that
meaning should not be left to fluctuate with the definition of “sale” in laws relating to
sale of goods which might be in force for the time being. ...”

28. Interpreting the expression of “sale of goods” at page 413 this Court held:
"...If the words “sale of goods” have to be interpreted in their legal sense, that sense
can only be what it has in the interpretation that words of legal import occurring in a
statute should be construed in their legal sense is that those words have, in law,
acquired a definite and precise sense, and that, accordingly, the legislature must be
taken to have intended that they should be understood in that sense. In interpreting
an expression used in a legal sense, therefore, we have only to ascertain the precise
connotation which it possesses in law. ...”
29. Summing up its conclusion this Court at page 425 held:
"To sum up, the expression “sale of goods” in Entry 48 is a nomen juris,its essential
ingredients being an agreement to sell movables for a price and property passing
therein pursuant to that agreement. In a building contract which is, as in the present
case, one,entire and indivisible- and that is its norm, there is no sale of goods, and it
is not within the competence of the Provincial Legislature under Entry 48 to impose
tax on the supply of the materials used in such a contract treating it as a sale.”
30. We may also notice the following pertinent observation made by this Court in the
above case at page 426:
“....It is also a fact that acting on the view that Entry 48 authorises it, the States have
enacted laws imposing a tax on the supply of materials in works contracts, and have
been realising it, and their validity has been affirmed by several High Courts. All
these laws were in the statute book when the Constitution came into force, and it is to
be regretted that there is nothing in it which offers a solution to the present question.
We have, no doubt, Art. 248 and Entry 97 in List I conferring residual power of
legislation on Parliament, but clearly it could not have been intended that the center
should have the power to tax with respect to works constructed in the States. In view
of the fact that the State Legislatures had given to the expression "sale of goods" in
Entry 48 a wider meaning than what it has in the Indian Sale of Goods Act, that
States with sovereign powers have in recent times been enacting laws imposing tax
on the use of materials in the construction of buildings, and that such a power should
more properly be lodged with the States rather than the center, the Constitution
might have given an inclusive definition of "sale" in Entry 54 so as to cover the
extended sense. But our duty is to interpret the law as we find it, and having
anxiously considered the question, we are of opinion that there is no sale as such of
materials used in a building contract, and that the Provincial Legislatures had no
competence to impose a tax thereon under Entry 48. ”
31. The ratio of the above judgment which is heavily relied by Shri Srivastava is that
this Court laid down that legal meaning of expression “sale of goods” has to be taken.
It is further submitted that this Court relied on the definition of “sale of goods” as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 11Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
occurring in Sale of Goods Act, 1930 for interpreting Entry 48 in List II Schedule VII
of the Government of India Act, 1935. We may notice that in the above judgment this
Court had occasion to deal with the definition of term “sale” and explaining the legal
meaning as existed at the time of enactment of Government of India Act, 1935, the
above law was laid down.
32. We may further notice that by the Constitution (Forty−sixth Amendment) Act,
1982 sub-Article (29A) has been inserted in the Article 366 of the Constitution.
Defining tax on sale or purchase of goods which is inclusive definition. the above
Constitution Amendment was made with the intent to tax on the sale or purchase of
goods on the transfer, otherwise than in pursuance of a contract, of property.
Definition of sale as interpreted by this Court in Gannon Dunkerley & Co.(Madras)
Ltd. case (supra) is no longer applicable any more and work contracts were also
taxed. We may also notice subsequent Constitution Bench judgment in the case of
M/s Gannon Dunkerley and Co. and Others Vs. State of Rajasthan and others, 1993
(1) SCC 364 , where this Court had occasion to examine Article 366(29A) sub-
clause (b) of the Constitution. This Court referring to its earlier judgment in Builders' Association of
India vs. Union of India, (1989) 2 SCC 645, made following observations in paragraphs 25 and 30:
“25. We find it difficult to accept this contention. The question whether as a result of
the Forty Sixth Amendment an independent taxing power has been conferred on the
States had arisen for consideration before this Court in Builders' Association case
(supra) since it was specifically raised in the contentions urged on behalf of the
States. While summarising the said contentions this Court has thus mentioned this
contention Sub-clause (b) of Clause 29-A of Article 366 of the Constitution has
conferred on the Legislatures of States the power to levy tax on works contract which
is independent of the power conferred on the Legislatures of the States under Entry
54 of the State List, (p.346). The said contention was rejected with these
observations.
The object of the new definition introduced in Clause (29-A) of Article 366 of the
Constitution is, therefore, to enlarge the scope of tax on sale or purchase of goods
wherever it occurs in the Constitution so that it may include within its scope the
transfer, delivery or supply of goods that may take place under any of the
transactions referred to in Sub-Clauses (a) to (f) thereof wherever such transfer,
delivery of supply becomes subject to levy. of sales tax. So construed the expression
tax on the sale or purchase of goods in Entry 54 of the State List, therefore, includes a
tax on the transfer of property in goods (whether as goods or in some other form)
involved in the execution of a works contract also. The tax leviable by virtue of
Sub-clause
(b) of Clause (29-A) of Article 366 of the Constitution thus becomes subject to the
same discipline to which any levy under Entry 54 of the State List is made subject to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 12Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
under the Constitution.”
30. Having regard to the observations referred to above and the stand of the parties
during the course of arguments before us, we do not consider it appropriate to reopen
the issues which ; are covered by the decision in Builders' Association case (supra)
and we will, therefore, deal with the matter in accordance with the law as laid down
in that case that the expression tax on the sale or purchase of goods in Entry 54 of the
State List includes a tax on the transfer of property in goods (whether as goods or in
some other form) involved in the execution of a works contract also and the tax
leviable by virtue of Sub-clause (b) of clause (29-A) of Article . 366 of the Constitution
is subject to the discipline to which any levy under Entry 54 of the State List is made
subject to under the Constitution. ”
33. Definition of goods as occurring in Section 311(12) of Government of India Act,
1935 although was noticed by this Court in Gannon Dunkerley and Co.(supra) but
definition of goods was not further elaborated.
Definition of goods as occurring in Article 366(12) is inclusive definition and does not specifically
excludes actionable claim from its definition. Whenever inclusive definition is given of an expression
it always intended to enlarge the meaning of words or phrases, used in the definition. In this
context, it is relevant to refer to the judgment of this Court in Reserve Bank of India vs. Peerless
General Finance and Investment co.Ltd. And others,1987(1) SCC 424 with regard to the inclusive
definition. Following was observed in paragraphs 32-33:
"32....All that is necessary for us to say is this: Legislatures resort to inclusive
definitions (1) to enlarge the meaning of words or phrases so as to take in the
ordinary, popular and natural sense of the words and also the sense which the statute
wishes to attribute to it, (2) to include meanings about which there might be some
dispute, or, (3) to bring under one nomenclature all transactions possessing certain
similar features but going under different names. ....
33. Interpretation must depend on the text and the context. They are the bases of
interpretation. One may well say if the text is the texture, context is what gives the
colour. Neither can be ignored. Both are important. That interpretation is best which
makes the textual interpretation match the contextual. A statute is best interpreted
when we know why it was enacted. ...”
34. The Constitution framers were well aware of the definition of goods as occurring
in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 when the Constitution was enforced. By providing an
inclusive definition of goods in Article 366(12), the Constitution framers never
intended to give any restrictive meaning of goods.
35. In The State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley & Co., (supra) this Court was
concerned with the Provincial Legislatures under Entry 48 in List II in Schedule VII
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 13Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
of the Government of India Act, 1935. We have extracted the observations made by
this Court at page
426. This Court at page 426 of the judgment held that none of the Provincial
Legislatures could have exercised the power conferred to make law with respect to
sale of goods in the Lists, to impose a tax on construction contracts. This Court
further observed that before such a law could be enacted it would have been
necessary to have had recourse to the residual powers of the Governor-General under
under Section 104 of the Act. This Court has further observed that it has no doubt,
Article 248 and Entry 97 of List I conferring residual powers of legislation on
Parliament, but clearly it could not have been intended that Centre should have
power to tax with respect to works constructed in the States.
36. The Act, 2017 is an Act of Parliament in exercise of power of Parliament as conferred under
Article 246A of the Constitution. Article 246A is extracted for ready reference:
“Article 246A. Special provision with respect to goods and services tax. (1)
Notwithstanding anything contained in articles 246 and 254, Parliament, and,
subject to clause (2), the Legislature of every State, have power to make laws with
respect to goods and services tax imposed by the Union or by such State.
(2) Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to goods and services
tax where the supply of goods, or of services, or both takes place in the course of
inter−State trade or commerce.
Explanation.—The provisions of this article, shall, in respect of goods and services tax referred to in
clause (5) of article 279A, take effect from the date recommended by the Goods and Services Tax
Council.”
37. When the Parliament has been conferred power to make law with respect to goods and services,
the legislative power of the Parliament is plenary. The observations of this Court in The State of
Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley & Co.,(supra) at page 426 are clear pointer that although the State
Legislature had no legislative competence to enact impugned legislation but Parliament on the
strength of residual power could have legislated. We are the view that the judgment of this Court in
The State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley & Co.,(supra) does not lend support to the submission of
the learned counsel for the petitioner that Parliament could not have defined the goods in Act, 2017,
expanding the definition of goods as existing in Sale of Goods Act, 1930.
38. Now, we come to the Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in Sunrise Associates vs. Govt.
of NCT of Delhi and others, (2006) 5 SCC 603, on which judgment learned counsel for both the
parties have placed reliance. The above Constitution Bench was constituted to reconsider the earlier
judgment of this Court in H. Anraj and Ors. Vs. Government of Tamil Nadu and Ors. , (1986) 1 SCC
424. Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the referring order (Sunrise Associates vs. Govt. of NCT of Delhi and
others, 2010 (10) SCC 420) reads:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 14Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
“4. We are inclined to agree that the judgment in H. Anraj requires reconsideration
for the reason that, prima facie, the only right of the purchaser of a lottery ticket is to
take the chance of winning the prize. There seems to us to be no good reason to split
the transaction of the sale of a lottery ticket into the acquisition of (I) the right to
participate in the lottery draw, and (ii) the right to win the prize, dependent on
chance.
5. In the case of Vikas Sales Corpn. v.
Commr. Of Commercial Taxes (1996 (4) SCC
433), a Bench of three learned Judges agreed with the decision in H. Anraj. It is, therefore,
necessary that these appeals should be heard by a Constitution Bench.”
39. Before we further look into the judgment of this Court in Sunrise Associates, we need to notice
very briefly judgment of this Court in H. Anraj. In the above case the question arose out of the levy
of tax on sales of lottery tickets under Tamil Nadu General Sales Act 1959. A writ petition was filed
questioning the levy of tax imposed on sale of lottery tickets before this Court. The contention which
was urged before this Court for challenging levy has been noticed in paragraph 5 of the judgment in
the following words:
“5. ....Counsel pointed out that under the charging provision contained in both the
Acts (s. 3 of the Tamil Nadu Act 1959 and Section 4 of the Bengal Act 1941) the
taxable event is the sale of goods (here lottery tickets) and the levy is imposed upon
the taxable turnover of every dealer in regard to the sales of lottery tickets and
therefore, quite clearly, each of the State Legislatures has purported to Act in the
exercise of its own taxing power under Entry 54 of List II. But according to counsel
Entry 54 of List II enables legislation imposing a tax, inter alia, on "sale of goods"
that it is well-settled that the expression "sale of goods" has to be construed in the
sense which it has in the Indian Sale of Goods Act, 1930(vide Ganon Dunkerley's
case) MANU/SC/0152/1958 : [1959]1SCR379 "goods under Section 2(7) thereof
comprises within its scope every kind of movable property but specifically excludes
actionable claim, that the essence of lottery is a chance for a prize, that a sale of such
a chance is not a sale of goods and therefore the levy of sales tax on sale of lottery
tickets would be beyond the ambit of Entry 54 of List II.
Alternatively, counsel contended that a lottery ticket is an actionable claim as defined
in Section 3 of Transfer of Property Act or a chose-in-action known to English law,
the ticket itself being merely a slip of paper or memorandum evidencing the right of
the holder thereof to claim or receive a prize if successful in the draw and therefore
the impugned levy is outside Entry 54 of List II. …”
40. This Court in the above judgment noted the definitions of goods as occurring in Sale of Goods
Act, 1930, sale of goods in Tamil Nadu General Sales Act, 1959, and definition of goods in Article
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 15Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
366 (12). After considering, this Court in H Anraj came to the conclusion that lottery to the extent
that they comprise the entitlement to participate in the draw are “goods” properly so called, and
they are not actionable claims. In paragraph 33 of the judgment following was laid down:
“33. In the light of the aforesaid discussion my conclusions are that lottery tickets to
the extent that they comprise the entitlement to participate in the draw are "goods"
properly so called, squarely falling within the definition of that expression as given in
the Tamil Nadu Act, 1959 and the Bengal Act, 1941, that to that extent they are not
actionable claims and that in every sale thereof a transfer of property in the goods is
involved. In view of these conclusions the impugned Amendments made in the two
concerned Acts for levying tax on sale of lottery tickets will have to be upheld as
falling within the legislative competence of the concerned State legislature under
Entry 54 of List II in the Seventh Schedule and therefore, we think it unnecessary to
go into the validity of the alternative submission made by the learned Attorney
General that legislative competence for enacting the impugned Amendments would
also be there under Entry 62 of List II in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.”
41. As noted above the judgment of H Anraj came to be questioned. A Bench of three Judges in Vikas
Sales Corporation and another vs. Commissioner of Commercial Taxes and another, (1996) 4 SCC
433, agreed with the decision of H Anaraj necessitating reference before the Constitution Bench in
Sunrise Associates, the Constitution Bench noticed the question which arose before the Constitution
Bench. In paragraph 29 it noticed that “only question we are called upon to answer is whatever the
decision in H Anaraj that lottery tickets are “goods” for the purposes of Article 366(29A)(a) of the
Constitution and the State sales tax laws, was correct”. The Constitution Bench in paragraph 33
observed that to the extent that the lottery ticket evidenced the right to claim the prize, it was not
goods but an actionable claim and therefore not “goods” under the sales tax laws. In paragraph 33
following has been observed:
"33. In other words, the second conclusion which we have indicated against 'B', was
the ratio. The lottery ticket was held to be merely evidence of the right to participate
in the draw and therefore goods the transfer of which was a sale. To the extent that
the lottery ticket evidenced the right to claim the prize, it was not goods but an
actionable claim and therefore not 'goods' under the Sales Tax Laws. A transfer of it
was consequently not a sale. The lottery ticket per se had no innate value. The
interpretation by the Delhi High Court of the ratio in H. Anraj was in our opinion
erroneous. ”
42. The pertinent observation has been made by the Constitution Bench in paragraph 36 wherein it
noticed that in States sales tax laws actionable claims have been uniformly excluded from the
definition of goods. This Court held “were actionable claims, etc. not otherwise includible in the
definition of “goods” there was no need for excluding them”. Following has been laid down in
paragraph 36:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 16Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
“36. We have noted earlier that all the statutory definitions of the word 'goods' in the
State Sales Tax Laws have uniformly excluded, inter alia, actionable claims from the
definition for the purposes of the Act. Were actionable claims etc., not otherwise
includible in the definition of 'goods' there was no need for excluding them. In other
words, actionable claims are 'goods' but not for the purposes of the Sales Tax Acts
and but for this statutory exclusion, an actionable claim would be 'goods' or the
subject matter of ownership. Consequently an actionable claim is movable property
and 'goods' in the wider sense of the term but a sale of an actionable claim would not
be subject to the sales tax laws.”
43. In paragraph 40 the Constitution Bench reiterated that a sale of lottery ticket also amounts to
the transfer of an actionable claim. Following was laid down in paragraph 40:
“40. An actionable claim would include a right to recover insurance money or a partner's right to sue
for an account of a dissolved partnership or the right to claim the benefit of a contract not coupled
with any liability (see Union of India v. Sarada Mills Ltd. SCC at p.880, (1972) 2 SCC 877 ). A claim
for arrears of rent has also been held to be an actionable claim (State of Bihar v.
Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh, SCR at p.910 (1952) SCR 889). A right to the credit in a
provident fund account has also' been held to an actionable claim (Official Trustee, Bengal v. L.
Chippendale, AIR 1944 Cal 335; Bhupati Mohan Das v. Phanindra Chandra Chakravarty and Anr.,
AIR 1935 Cal 756. In our opinion a sale of a lottery ticket also amounts to the transfer of an
actionable claim.”
44. Further in paragraphs 46 and 48 this Court held lottery to be an actionable claim. Paragraphs 46
and 48 are to the following effect:
“46. There is no value in the mere right to participate in the draw and the purchaser
does not pay for the right to participate. The consideration is paid for the chance to
win. There is therefore no distinction between the two rights. The right to participate
being an inseparable part of the chance to win is therefore part of an actionable
claim.
48. Even if the right to participate is assumed to be a separate right, there is no sale of
goods within the meaning of sales tax statutes when that right is transferred. When
H. Anraj said that the right to participate was a beneficial interest in movable
property, it did not define what that movable property was. The draw could not and
was not suggested to be the movable property. The only object of the right to
participate would be to win the prize. The transfer of the right would thus be of a
beneficial interest in movable property not in possession. By this reasoning also a
right to participate in a lottery is an actionable claim. ”
45. This Court concluded in paragraph 51 that in H Anraj it was incorrectly held that
a sale of a lottery ticket involved a sale of goods. Paragraph 51 is as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 17Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
“51 We are therefore of the view that the decision in H. Anraj incorrectly held that a
sale of a lottery ticket involved a sale of goods. There was no sale of goods within the
meaning of Sales Tax Acts of the different States but at the highest a transfer of an
actionable claim. The decision to the extent that it held otherwise is accordingly
overruled though prospectively with effect from the date of this judgment. ”
46. One of the submissions which has been pressed by Shri Srivastava is that the
observations made by the Constitution Bench in the above paragraphs that lottery is
an actionable claim is based on an obiter dicta since the question was not up for
consideration. He submits that Court was to consider as to whether lottery tickets are
goods or not within the meaning of Section 2(j) of Tamil Nadu General Sales Act,
1959 as amended. The definition of goods in Section 2(j) as noticed by the
Constitution Bench in paragraph 9 states that 'goods' means all kinds of movable
property (other than newspaper, actionable claims, stocks, shares and securities).
The exclusion of the actionable claims from the goods as enumerated in the definition
is also a part of the definition.
If a particular item is covered by exclusion it is obvious that it does not fall in the definition of the
goods. When the Constitution Bench came to the conclusion that the lottery is an actionable claim it
was considering the definition of 2(j) itself and what has been held by the Constitution Bench cannot
be held to be obiter dicta.
47. Explaining obiter dicta this Court in Municipal Corporation of Delhi vs. Gurnam Kau, 1989(1)
SCC 101, made following observation in paragraphs 10 and 11:
"10....The only thing in a judge's decision binding as an authority upon a subsequent
judge is the principle upon which the case was decided. Statements which are not
part of the ratio decidendi are distinguished as obiter dicta and and are not
authoritative. ....
11. Pronouncements of law, which are not part of the ratio decidendi are classed as
obiter dicta and are not authoritative. ....”
48. It cannot be said that the question as to whether lottery is a goods or actionable claim had not
arisen in the decision in Sunrise Associates. When an item was covered by excluded category, the
said conclusion could have been arisen only after consideration of the definition and the
exclusionary clause. We, thus, are not in agreement with the submission of the learned counsel for
the petitioner that the observations of the Constitution Bench holding lottery as actionable claim is
only obiter dicta and not binding. The Constitution Bench in Sunrise Associates has categorically
held that lottery is actionable claim after due consideration which is ratio of the judgment. When
Section 2(52) of Act, 2017 expanded the definition of goods by including actionable claim also, the
said definition in Section 2(52) is in the line with the Constitution Bench pronouncement in Sunrise
Associates and no exception can be taken to the definition of the goods as occurring in Section 2(52).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 18Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
49. We are of the view that definition of goods under Section 2(52) of the Act,2017 does not violate
any constitutional provision nor it is in conflict with the definition of goods given under Article
366(12). Article 366 clause(12) as observed contains an inclusive definition and the definition given
in Section 2(52) of Act, 2017 is not in conflict with definition given in Article 366(12). As noted
above the Parliament by the Constitution(One Hundred and First Amendment) Act, 2016 inserted
Article 246A. a special provision with respect to goods and services tax. The Parliament was fully
empowered to make laws with respect to goods and services tax. Article 246A begins with non
obstante clause that is “Notwithstanding anything contained in Articles 246 and 254”, Which
confers very wide power to make laws. The power to make laws as conferred by Article 246A fully
empowers the Parliament to make laws with respect to goods and services tax and expansive
definition of goods given in Section 2(52) cannot be said to be not in accord with the constitutional
provisions.
50. Shri Shrivastava with his usual ability and skill submits that Parliament does not enjoy an
absolute power to make an inclusive definition of something to be taxed, which is not taxable
otherwise. The power of legislature to lay definition has limitations and cannot include something
which cannot in rational sense be included. While goods and actionable claims are both different
concepts, lottery has no resemblance with either. The legislature can only provide an extended
meaning by inclusive definition only for preventing tax evasion. To support his submission, he has
relied on judgment of this Court in Bhopal Sugar Industries Ltd., M.P. And Anr. Vs. D.P. Dube, Sales
Tax Officer and Anr., (1964) 1 SCR
481. The facts of the case have been noticed by the Constitution Bench of this Court in following
words:
“By this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution it is claimed that the definition
of “retail sale” in Section 2(1) of the Act which seeks to render consumption by the
owner of motor-spirit liable to tax under the Act by virtue of Section 3 is beyond the
competence of the State Legislature and hence void and the order of the first
respondent seeking to impose liability upon the Company for payment of tax
infringes the fundamental rights of the Company under Article 19(1)
(f) and (g) of the Constitution.”
51. This Court held that consumption by an owner of goods in which he deals is not a
sale within the meaning of sale of goods. It was held that extended definition, which
includes consumption by a retail dealer of motor spirit or lubricants is beyond the
competence of the State legislature. Following was laid down by this Court:-
“Consumption by an owner of goods in which he deals is therefore not a sale within
the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act and therefore it is not “sale of goods” within the
meaning of Entry 54 List II Schedule VII of the Constitution. The legislative power
for levying tax on sale of goods being restricted to enacting legislation for levying tax
on transactions which conform to the definition of sale of goods within the meaning
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 19Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, the extended definition which includes consumption
by a retail dealer himself of motor spirit or lubricants sold to him for retail sale” is
beyond the competence of the State legislature. But the clause in the definition in,
Section (1) “and includes the consumption by a retail dealer himself or on his behalf
of motor spirit or lubricant to him for retail sale which is ultra vires the State
Legislature because of lack of competence under Entry 54 in List II Schedule VII of
the Constitution is saverable, from the rest of the definition, and that clause alone
must be declared invalid.”
52. In the above case, the Constitution Bench was considering the concept of “sale”
and the extended definition of sale by which consumption by owner himself was
treated to be sale was held ultra vires to the legislative competence of the State. The
present is a case where we are not dealing with concept of sale and further in the case
before us, it is the Parliament, which has enacted the Act, 2017 which has competence
to make a law imposing tax on goods and services.
53. We may notice another Constitution Bench Judgment of this Court in
Navinchandra Mafatlal Bombay Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay City, AIR
1955 SC
58. In the above case, challenge was made to Section 12-B of the Indian Income Tax
Act, 1922. It was contended that Section 12-B, which authorise the levy of tax on
capital gains was ultra vires to the central legislature. The Constitution Bench laid
down following in paragraph 5:-
“5. ………………………….If we hold, as we are asked to do, that the meaning of the word
“income” has become rigidly crystallized by reason of the judicial interpretation of
that word appearing in the Income Tax Act then logically no enlargement of the scope
of the Income Tax Act, by amendment or otherwise, will be permissible in future. A
conclusion so extravagant and astounding can scarcely be contemplated or
countenanced.
XXXXXXXXXX”
54. This Court further laid down that a word appearing in a Constitution Act, must
not be construed in any narrow and pedantic sense. Following was laid down in
paragraph 6:-
“6. It should be remembered that the question before us relates to the correct
interpretation of a word appearing in a Constitution Act which, as has been said,
must not be construed in any narrow and pedantic sense………………………”
55. Another judgment of Constitution Bench of this Court to be noticed is Navnitlal C.
Javeri Vs. K.K. Sen, Appellate, Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax, (1965) 1 SCR
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 20Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
909. In the above case, question arose regarding constitutionality of Section 12(1B)
read with Section 2(6A)(e) of Income Tax Act, 1922. It was contended before this
court that a loan advanced to a shareholder by the company cannot, in any legitimate
sense, be treated as his income; and so, the artificial manner in which such dividend
is ordered to be treated as income by the impugned provision is not justified. It is
true that this Court has laid down that Parliament cannot choose to tax as income an
item which in no rational sense can be regarded as a citizen’s income. Following was
observed:-
“This doctrine does not, however, mean that Parliament can choose to tax as income
an item which in no rational sense can be regarded as a citizen's income. The item
taxed should rationally be capable of being considered as the income of a citizen. But
in considering the question as to whether a particular item in the hands of a citizen
can be regarded as his income or not, it would be inappropriate to apply the tests
traditionally prescribed by the Income Tax Act as such.”
56. This Court held that legislature has not travelled beyond the legislative field while
enacting the impugned provision. Following was observed:-
“………………………There must no doubt be some rational connection between the item
taxed and the concept of income liberally construed. If the legislature realises that the
private controlled companies generally adopt the device of making advances or giving
loans to their shareholders with the object of evading the payment of tax, it can step
in to meet this mischief, and in that connection, it has created a fiction by which the
amount ostensibly and nominally advanced to a shareholder as a loan is treated in
reality for tax purposes as the payment of dividend to him. We have already
explained how a small number of shareholders controlling a private company adopt
this device. Having regard to the fact that the legislature was aware of such devices,
would it not be competent to the legislature to devise a fiction for treating the
ostensible loan as the receipt of dividend? In our opinion, it would be difficult to hold
that in making the fiction, the legislature has travelled beyond the legislative field
assigned to it by Entry 82 in List I.”
57. In view of what has been laid down by the Constitution Bench, as above, there has
to be a rational connection between the item taxed but it is well settled that with
regard to taxing policy of the legislature, the Courts have very limited role to play. It
is useful to refer the observations of this Court in Sri Krishna Das Vs. Town Area
Committee, Chirgaon, (1990) 3 SCC 645 wherein paragraph 31, following was
observed:-
“31. The contention that the tax is discriminatory in view of the exemptions granted
to some of the products and to those that enter the TAC by rail or motor transport is
equally untenable. It is for the legislature or the taxing authority to determine the
question of need, the policy and to select the goods or services for taxation. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 21Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
courts cannot review these decisions……………….”
58. We have already noted that under Article 246A notwithstanding anything
contained in Articles 246 and 254, Parliament has power to make laws with respect to
goods and services tax. Article 246A is a special provision with regard to goods and
services tax w.e.f. 16.09.2016, which special power has to be liberally construed
empowering the Parliament to make laws with respect to goods and services tax. The
submission of learned counsel for the petitioner is that actionable claim has been
artificially and with a view to assume the power to tax has been included in Section
2(52). The Constitution Bench of this Court in Sunrise Associates (supra) has held
that actionable claims are includible in the definition of goods and had actionable
claims were not includible there was no need for excluding them. The Constitution
Bench held “were actionable claims, etc., not otherwise includible in the definition of
“goods”, there was no need for excluding them. In other words, actionable claims are
“goods” but not for the purpose of Sales Tax Acts and but for this statutory exclusion,
an actionable claim would be “goods” or the subject-matter of ownership”.
59. Thus, in view of what has been said above by the Constitution Bench, the
submission of the petitioner that actionable claims have been artificially included in
the definition of goods cannot be accepted. The Constitution Bench has clearly laid
down that actionable claims are goods. We, thus, do not agree with the submission of
Shri Shrivastava that Parliament has exceeded its jurisdiction in including actionable
claims in the definition of “goods” under Section 2(52).
60. We, thus, answer Question Nos.II and III in the following manner:
Answer No.II
61. The inclusion of actionable claim in definition “goods” as given in Section 2(52) of
Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 is not contrary to the legal meaning of
goods and is neither illegal nor unconstitutional.
Answer NO.III
62. The Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in Sunrise Associates has laid down that lottery
is an actionable claim as proposition of law. The observation cannot be said to be obiter dicta.
Question No. IV
63. As noted above, another limb of attack mounted by Shri Shrivastava is on the ground of hostile
discrimination while taxing lottery, betting and gambling and excluding other actionable claims.
Reference is made to Item No.6 of Schedule III of Act, 2017. Schedule III begins with heading
“activities or transactions which shall be treated neither as supply of goods nor supply of services.
Item No.6 of Schedule III is as follows:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 22Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
“Item No.6 – Actionable claims other than lottery, betting and gambling.”
64. Submission is that assuming the lotteries to be actionable claims, the Act, 2017 suffers from a
hostile discrimination in first including actionable claims within the category of goods and then
excluding all actionable claims from supply of goods and creating a further exception of lottery,
betting and gambling in Schedule III. Further submission is that there is no intelligible differentia
for excluding lotteries, betting and gambling from the other actionable claims, nor does such
exclusion have any nexus with the purpose of the Act. In support of the above preposition, Shri
Shrivastava has relied on judgment of this Court in Ayurveda Pharmacy and Anr. Vs. State of Tamil
Nadu, (1989) 2 SCC 285. This Court in the above case laid down that when the commodities belong
to same class or category, there must be rational basis for discrimination between one commodity
and other for purpose of imposing the tax. In paragraph 6 of the judgment, following has been laid
down:-
6. ……………It is open to the legislature, or the State Government if it is authorised in
that behalf by the legislature, to select different rates of tax for different commodities.
But where the commodities belong to the same class or category, there must be a
rational basis for discriminating between one commodity and another for the
purpose of imposing tax. It is commonly known that considerations of economic
policy constitute a basis for levying different rates of sales tax. For instance, the
object may be to encourage a certain trade or industry in the context of the State
policy for economic growth, and a lower rate would be considered justified in the case
of such a commodity. There may be several such considerations bearing directly on
the choice of the rate of sales tax, and so long as there is good reason for making the
distinction from other commodities no complaint can be made. What the actual rate
should be is not a matter for the courts to determine generally, but where a
distinction is made between commodities falling in the same category a question
arises at once before a court whether there is justification for the
discrimination………………………”
65. Another judgment laying down the same preposition as relied by learned counsel for the
petitioner is State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors. Vs. Deepak Fertilizers & Petrochemical Corporation
Ltd., (2007) 10 SCC 342.
66. There can be no dispute to the above preposition laid down by this Court. The question to be
answered is as to whether there is any rational reason for taking out only three actionable claims,
i.e., lottery, betting and gambling while leaving other actionable claims from tax net.
67. Whether there is any rational basis for taking out only these three actionable claims is a question
to be answered, whether the legislature has created a hostile discrimination by taxing only these
three whereas leaving other actionable claims out of the tax net.
68. Even before enforcement of the Constitution of India, there were several legislations by different
States regulating lottery, betting and gambling. Before a Constitution bench of this court in State of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 23Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
Bombay Vs. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala and Anr., AIR 1957 SC 699 , this Court had occasion to
consider the nature of activities akin to lottery, betting and gambling. Bombay Lotteries and prize
Competition Control and Tax Act, 1948 was enacted to regulate the tax, lotteries and prize
competition. The petitioner, who was conducting and running the prize competition from State of
Mysore where entries were received from various parts of India including the State of Bombay had
challenged the Act, 1948 and the Rules namely Bombay Lotteries and Prize Competitions Control
and Tax Rules, 1952. The writ petition was allowed by the High Court, against which State of
Bombay had filed an appeal. The Constitution Bench held the activity of respondent as activity of
gambling nature. This Court laid down following in paragraphs 41 and 46:-
“41. It will be abundantly clear from the foregoing observations that the activities
which have been condemned in this country from ancient times appear to have been
equally discouraged and looked upon with disfavour in England, Scotland, the United
States of America and in Australia in the cases referred to above. We find it difficult
to accept the contention that those activities which encourage a spirit of reckless
propensity for making easy gain by lot or chance, which lead to the loss of the hard
earned money of the undiscerning and improvident common man and thereby lower
his standard of living and drive him into a chronic state of indebtedness and
eventually disrupt the peace and happiness of his humble home could possibly have
been intended by our Constitution makers to be raised to the status of trade,
commerce or intercourse and to be made the subject-matter of a fundamental right
guaranteed by Article 19(1)(g). We find it difficult to persuade ourselves that
gambling was ever intended to form any part of this ancient country's trade,
commerce or intercourse to be declared as free under Article 301. It is not our
purpose nor is it necessary for us in deciding this case to attempt an exhaustive
definition of the word “trade”, “business”, or “intercourse”. We are, however, clearly
of opinion that whatever else may or may not be regarded as falling within the
meaning of these words, gambling cannot certainly be taken as one of them. We are
convinced and satisfied that the real purpose of Articles 19(1)(g) and 301 could not
possibly have been to guarantee or declare the freedom of gambling. Gambling
activities from their very nature and in essence are extra- commercium although the
external forms, formalities and instruments of trade may be employed and they are
not protected either by Article 19(1)(g) or Article 301 of our Constitution.
46. For the reasons stated above, we have come to the conclusion that the impugned
law is a law with respect to betting and gambling under Entry 34 and the impugned
taxing section is a law with respect to tax on betting and gambling under Entry 62
and that it was within the legislative competence of the State Legislature to have
enacted it. There is sufficient territorial nexus to entitle the State Legislature to
collect the tax from the petitioners who carry on the prize competitions through the
medium of a newspaper printed and published outside the State of Bombay. The
prize competitions being of a gambling nature, they cannot be regarded as trade or
commerce and as such the petitioners cannot claim any fundamental right under
Article 19(1)(g) in respect of such competitions, nor are they entitled to the protection
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 24Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
of Article 301. The result, therefore, is that this appeal must be allowed and the
orders of the lower courts set aside and the petitions dismissed and we do so with
costs throughout. The state will get only one set of costs of hearing of 1956
throughout.”
69. In a later decision, Union of India and Ors. Vs. Martin Lottery Agencies Limited,
(2009) 12 SCC 209, this Court had occasion to consider levy of service tax on the
lottery tickets. This Court had held that law as it stands today recognises lottery to be
gambling, which is res extra commercium. In paragraph 17, following has been laid
down:-
“17. We fail to persuade ourselves to agree with the aforementioned submission. The
law, as it stands today (although it is possible that this Court in future may take a
different view), recognises lottery to be gambling. Gambling is res extra commercium
as has been held by this Court in State of Bombay v. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala [AIR
1957 SC 699] and B.R. Enterprises v. State of U.P. [(1999) 9 SCC 700]”
70. Lottery, betting and gambling are well known concepts and have been in practice
in this country since before independence and were regulated and taxed by different
legislations. When Act, 2017 defines the goods to include actionable claims and
included only three categories of actionable claims, i.e., lottery, betting and gambling
for purposes of levy of GST, it cannot be said that there was no rationale for including
these three actionable claims for tax purposes. Regulation including taxation in one
or other form on the activities namely lottery, betting and gambling has been in
existence since last several decades. When the parliament has included above three
for purpose of imposing GST and not taxed other actionable claims, it cannot be said
that there is no rationale or reason for taxing above three and leaving others.
71. It is a duty of the State to strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing
and protecting, as effectively as it may, a social order in which justice, social,
economic and political, shall inform all the institutions of the national life. The
Constitution Bench in State of Bombay Vs. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala and Anr. (supra)
has clearly stated that Constitution makers who set up an ideal welfare State have
never intended to elevate betting and gambling on the level of country's trade or
business or commerce. In this country, the aforesaid were never accorded recognition
of trade, business or commerce and were always regulated and taxing the lottery,
gambling and betting was with the objective as noted by the Constitution Bench in
the case of State of Bombay Vs. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala and Anr.
(supra), we, thus, do not accept the submission of the petitioner that there is any hostile
discrimination in taxing the lottery, betting and gambling and not taxing other actionable claims.
The rationale to tax the aforesaid is easily comprehensible as noted above. Hence, we do not find
any violation of Article 14 in Item No. 6 of Schedule III of the Act, 2017.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 25Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
Question No.5
72. The petitioner’s contention is that price money should be abated from the face value of the
lottery ticket for levy of GST. The prices are paid to the winner of the lottery ticket by the
distributer/agent. It has been submitted that in the earlier regime of service tax also for the
purposes of computing service tax the value of service tax was taken into account as the total face
value of the ticket sold minus the total cost of the ticket and the prize money paid by the distributor.
Further, service tax was levied at a miniscule rate of 0.82% and 1.2% as compared to the exorbitant
rate of 28% which is being charged now. The question to be answered is that while determining the
face value of the ticket for levy of tax the price money of the ticket is to be excluded. The reliance has
also been placed on the circular dated 14.02.2007 which provided that the value of taxable service
shall be taken into account at the total face value of the ticket sold minus (a) the total cost of the
ticket paid by the distributor to the State Government and
(b) price money paid by the distributer. Further, reliance has been placed on the Constitution Bench
judgment of this Court in M/s. Gannon Dunkerley and co. and others vs. State of Rajasthan and
others, 1993(1) SCC 364, where the Constitution Bench laid down that the value of the goods
involved in execution of a works contract on which tax is leviable must exclude the charges which
appertain to the contract for supply of labour and services. The reliance is placed on paragraph 47 of
the judgment which is to the following effect:
“45. Keeping in view the legal fiction introduced by the Forty Sixth Amendment
whereby the works contract which are entire and indivisible into one for sale of goods
and other for supply of labour and services, the value of the goods involved in the
execution of a works contract on which tax is leviable must exclude the charges which
appertain to the contract for supply of labour and services. This would mean that
labour charges for execution of works item no (i) amounts paid to a sub- contractor
for labour and services [item No. (ii), charges for planning, designing and architect's
fees [item No. (iii), charges for obtaining on hire or otherwise machinery and tools
used in the execution of a works contact [item No. (iv), and the cost of consumables
such as water, electricity, fuel etc. which are consumed in the process of execution of
a works contract item No. (v) and other similar expenses for labour and services will
have to be excluded as charges for supply of labour and services. ...”
73. We may first notice the statutory scheme under the Act, 2017 and Rules framed thereunder
regarding determination of value of supply. Section 15 of the Act deals with value of taxable supply.
Section 15 (1) to (4) which is relevant for the present case is as follows:
Section 15. (1) The value of a supply of goods or services or both shall be the
transaction value, which is the price actually paid or payable for the said supply of
goods or services or both where the supplier and the recipient of the supply are not
related and the price is the sole consideration for the supply.
(2) The value of supply shall include–––
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 26Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
(a) any taxes, duties, cesses, fees and charges levied under any law for the time being
in force other than this Act, the State Goods and Services Tax Act, the Union
Territory Goods and Services Tax Act and the Goods and Services Tax (Compensation
to States) Act, if charged separately by the supplier;
(b) any amount that the supplier is liable to pay in relation to such supply but which
has been incurred by the recipient of the supply and not included in the price actually
paid or payable for the goods or services or both;
(c) incidental expenses, including commission and packing, charged by the supplier
to the recipient of a supply and any amount charged for anything done by the
supplier in respect of the supply of goods or services or both at the time of, or before
delivery of goods or supply of services;
(d) interest or late fee or penalty for delayed payment of any consideration for any
supply; and
(e) subsidies directly linked to the price excluding subsidies provided by the Central
Government and State Governments.
Explanation.––For the purposes of this sub−section, the amount of subsidy shall be included in the
value of supply of the supplier who receives the subsidy.
(3) The value of the supply shall not include any discount which is given––
(a) before or at the time of the supply if such discount has been duly recorded in the invoice issued
in respect of such supply; and
(b) after the supply has been effected, if —(i) such discount is established in terms of an agreement
entered into at or before the time of such supply and specifically linked to relevant invoices; and
(ii) input tax credit as is attributable to the discount on the basis of document issued by the supplier
has been reversed by the recipient of the supply.
(4) Where the value of the supply of goods or services or both cannot be determined under sub−
section (1), the same shall be determined in such manner as may be prescribed.”
74. The Rules have been framed, namely, the Central Goods and Services Tax Rules, 2017 in which
Rules by notification dated 23.01.2018 Rule 31A has been inserted dealing with value of supply in
case of lottery, betting, gambling and horse racing. Article 31A as was inserted provides as follows:
“Section 31A. Value of supply in case of lottery, betting, gambling and horse racing. −
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the provisions of this Chapter, the value in
respect of supplies specified below shall be determined in the manner provided
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 27Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
hereinafter.
(2) (a) The value of supply of lottery run by State Governments shall be deemed to be
100/112 of the face value of ticket or of the price as notified in the Official Gazette by
the organising State, whichever is higher.
(b) The value of supply of lottery authorised by State Governments shall be deemed
to be 100/128 of the face value of ticket or of the price as notified in the Official
Gazette by the organising State, whichever is higher.
Explanation:– For the purposes of this sub− rule, the expressions−
(a) ―lottery run by State Governments means a lottery not allowed to be sold in any State other than
the organizing State;
(b) ―lottery authorised by State Governments(cid:136) means a lottery which is authorised to be sold in
State(s) other than the organising State also; and
(c) ―Organising State has the same meaning as assigned to it in clause (f) of sub−rule (1) of rule 2 of
the Lotteries (Regulation) Rules, 2010.
(3) The value of supply of actionable claim in the form of chance to win in betting, gambling or horse
racing in a race club shall be 100% of the face value of the bet or the amount paid into the
totalisator.”
75. Rule 31A has now been amended vide notification dated 02.03.2020 by which following sub-rule
(2) has been substituted:
“Sub-Rule (2). The value of supply of lottery shall be deemed to be 100/128 of the
face value of ticket or of the price as notified in the Official Gazette by the Organising
State, whichever is higher.”
76. We may first deal with submission of the petitioner based on circular dated
14.02.2007. Circular dated 14.02.2007 was issued when the service tax was levied on
distributor of paper lottery. The circular provided for determination of value of
taxable service by deducting total cost of ticket paid by the distributor and price
money paid by the distributor, that was regime when it was treated as business
auxilliary service rendered by distributor. The said circular has no relevance or
application after the 2017 enactment.
77. We may also refer to Constitution Bench judgment of Gannon Dankerley and
Co.(second) where this Court laid down that value of the goods involved in the
execution of the works contract on which tax is leviable must exclude the charges
which appertain to the contract for supply of labour and services. As noted above in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 28Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
paragraph 47 this Court noted items which were to be excluded while determining
the value of goods involved in the works contract. What was held by this Court in the
above case relates to works contract which judgment has no application on the issue
which has arisen before us that is abatement of price money while determining the
value of the lottery.
78. For determining the value of the lottery, now, there is statutory provision
contained in Section 15 read with Rule 31A as noted above. Section 15 of the Act, 2017
by sub-section (2) it is provided what shall be included in the value of supply. What
can be included in the value is enumerated in sub-clause (a) to (e) of sub-section (2)
of Section 15. Further, sub-
section (3) of Section 15 provides that what shall not be included in the value of the supply. When
there are specific statutory provisions enumerating what should be included in the value of the
supply and what shall not be included in the value of the supply we cannot accept the submission of
the petitioner that prize money is to be abated for determining the value of taxable supply. What is
the value of taxable supply is subject to the statutory provision which clearly regulates, which
provision has to be given its full effect and something which is not required to be excluded in the
value of taxable supply cannot be added by judicial interpretation.
79. Further, Rule 31A as noted above, sub-rule (2) as amended clearly provides that value of supply
shall be deemed to be 100/128 of the face value of ticket or of the prize as notified in the Official
Gazette by the Organising State, whichever is higher. Learned Additional Solicitor General has
explained the working of Rule 31A of Rules by giving an example:
“For example, if Rs. 100 is the face value of lottery ticket, 28% GST is levied only on
Rs.78.125[(100*28)/128]. GST amount will be 21.875. Therefore, Rs.100 includes
GST of 21.875 on the taxable value of Rs.78.125. This is a mechanism to split the face
value of Rs.100 in two parts (A and B). A is the transaction value. B is GST on A. The
formula as above is to come to A by reverse calculation.”
80. The value of taxable supply is a matter of statutory regulation and when the value is to be
transaction value which is to be determined as per Section 15 it is not permissible to compute the
value of taxable supply by excluding prize which has been contemplated in the statutory scheme.
When prize paid by the distributor/agent is not contemplated to be excluded from the value of
taxable supply, we are not persuaded to accept the submission of the petitioner that prize money
should be excluded for computing the taxable value of supply the prize money should be excluded.
We, thus, conclude that while determining the taxable value of supply the prize money is not to be
excluded for the purpose of levy of GST.
81. Learned counsel for the petitioner has also relied on various taxing statutes of other countries,
wherein the petitioner submits that prize money of the lottery ticket are not being computing for
levy of tax. He has referred to provisions of United Kingdom- Value Added Tax, 1994; Excise Tax Act
of Canada; Goods and Services Tax Act of Singapore; Goods and Services Act, 1985 of New Zealand
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/156665259/ 29Skill Lotto Solutions Pvt Ltd. vs Union Of India on 3 December, 2020
and Sri Lanka-Value Added Tax Act, 2002. When the levy of GST, determination of taxable value are
governed by the Parliamentary Act in this country, we are of the view that legislative scheme of other
countries may not be relevant for determining the issue which has been raised before us. The taxing
policy and the taxing statute of various countries are different which are in accordance with taxing
regime suitable and applicable in different countries. The issue which has been raised before us has
to be answered by looking into the statutory provisions of the Act, 2017 and the Rules framed
therein which govern the field.
82. In the foregoing discussion we are of the view that the petitioner is not entitled to reliefs as
claimed in the writ petition.
83. We may, however, notice that petitioner has prayed for grant of liberty of challenging the
notifications dated 21.02.2020/02.03.2020 by which rate of GST for lottery run by the State and
lottery organized by the State have been made the same, which notification has not been challenged
in the writ petition since the notifications were issued during the pendency of writ petition.
Petitioner has prayed that the said issue be left open, the notification having not been challenged in
the writ petition liberty be given to the petitioner to challenge the same in appropriate proceedings.
We accept the above prayer of the petitioner. The petitioner shall be at liberty to challenge the
notifications dated 21.02.2020/02.03.2020 (challenging the rate of levy tax uniformally at 28%)
separately in appropriate proceedings. Subject to liberty as above, the writ petition is dismissed.
