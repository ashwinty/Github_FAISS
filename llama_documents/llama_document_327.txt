JUDGMENT
This appeal is directed against the judgment and decree passed by the first appellate court in
A.S.No.307 of 2001 dated 31.12.2003 in interfering with the judgment and decree passed by the trial
court made in O.S.No.1262 of 1991 dated 23.08.2000 in partially decreeing the suit.
2. The appellant was the defendant and the respondent was the plaintiff before the trial court.
3. The case of the plaintiff as stated in the plaint would be as follows:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163872472/ 1L.C.Saptharishi vs E.D.Balasubramanian on 28 March, 2012
The suit site belongs to the plaintiff. On 29.11.1984, it was leased out to the defendant
for a period of five years for storing cylinders at Rs.1,500/- p.m. It was agreed to
renew the lease for further five years at the option of the plaintiff. In case the plaintiff
declines, the defendant has to vacate and hand over vacant possession. The plaintiff
wanted the property for his own use. Hence, on 29.11.1989, the request of the
defendant for renewal was turned down. Even though, at the request of the defendant
seven months time from 29.11.1989 was given to the defendant to vacate, however, at
the cost of Rs.2,500/- p.m. But from April 1990, the defendant had paid only
Rs.1,500/-p.m. On 05.06.1990, he had requested the plaintiff to renew the lease for
three years and collect the balance rent. The plaintiff did not agree for the same.
Again the defendant paid Rs.1,500/- per month. On 21.10.1990, by a lawyer notice,
the plaintiff terminated the tenancy and sought for vacant possession by the end of
28.11.1990 and also damages at Rs.4,000/- per month from November 1990 for use
and occupation. He did not vacate the property. On 21.11.1990, the defendant sent a
false reply. Thus, the plaintiff sought for recovery of vacant possession; Rs.3067/-
towards damages at the rate of Rs.4,000/- p.m for 23 days from 29.11.1990; and for
future damages at the said rate.
4. The case of the defendant as set out in the written statement would be as follows:-
On 29.11.1984, under an unregistered and insufficiently stamped lease deed the
defendant took lease of the site for five years with effect from 29.11.1984 at
Rs.1,500/- p.m. He built the superstructure. The plaintiff agreed for renewing the
lease for five years at Rs.2,500/- p.m till November 1992 and from December 1992 to
November 1994 at Rs.3000/- p.m. The defendant also gave a draft lease agreement.
The plaintiff not renewed the lease. He kept quite. However, from December 1989 till
March 1990, the defendant paid rent at Rs.2,500/- p.m believing that the plaintiff
will renew the lease. From April 1990, the defendant paid only Rs.1,500/- p.m since
the plaintiff withheld renewal of the lease. However, subsequently the defendant
started paying Rs.2,500/- p.m. The request for renewal was not turned down. The
renewal for three years nor permission for seven months was sought for. There is no
arrears of rent. The Notice to quit dated 21.12.1990 is not in accordance with Section
106 of the Transfer of Property Act. It is not valid and proper. On the request of the
defendant, the plaintiff levelled the ground for safety purposes. He had agreed to
complete it before January 1990. The defendant also removed the southern side fence
and reduced the expenses of the plaintiff. But, suddenly the plaintiff stopped the
levelling work. The defendant had put up superstructure at a cost of Rs.90,000/-
with the knowledge and permission of the plaintiff. Since the lease is unregistered,
the suit is not maintainable. The defendant prayed for dismissal of the suit.
5. The trial court framed necessary issues on the basis of the pleadings and entered trial. After
appraising the evidence adduced before it, it had come to the conclusion of dismissing the suit
except the prayer for payment of damages for use and occupation at Rs.4,000/- per month from the
date of the plaint.

6. Aggrieved by the judgment and decree passed by the trial court, the plaintiff preferred an appeal
before the first appellate court in A.S.No.307 of 2001. The first appellate court heard the arguments
of both sides and had come to the conclusion of setting aside the judgment and decree of the trial
court and thus, the suit was decreed for delivery of vacant possession and for damages at Rs.4000/-
per month for use and occupation from the date of suit till the date of delivery with proportionate
costs.
7. Against the judgment and decree passed by the first appellate court, the aggrieved defendant
preferred the present appeal.
8. On admission of the appeal, this Court has framed the following questions of law for
consideration in the Second Appeal:-
1) Section 3 of the Amendment of the T.P. Act applies only to suit or proceedings
which means either a suit for possession or ejectment or other eviction proceedings
does not include appeals. Whether applying the amended provisions to appeals by
lower appellate court is valid under law or not ?
2) In any event, without prejudice to the other grounds of appeals, it is also submitted
that the amended Section 3 insofar as it acts retrospectively to a limited extent is
unreasonable and arbitrary and consequently unconstitutional as much as it takes
away the vested rights accrued to the parties. There is no jurisdiction and rationale
for giving retrospective effect to the amended provision of Section 3. Therefore,
whether the lower appellate court was correct in applying this amended provisions
retrospectively to this case or not ?
3) Whether the amended provision under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act
is applicable to the present case retrospectively ?
4) Whether the tenant continues to be in premises after the expiry of lease period.
Whether the lower appellate court was correct in observing that the tenancy is not in
holding over ?
5) In the absence of an agreement, whether the lower appellate court is correct in
holding that the tenancy is not by month to month ?
9. Heard Mr.N.C.Ramesh, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of M/s.V.Rangarajan, learned
counsel for the appellant and Mr.V.Subramani, learned counsel appearing for the respondent.
10. The learned counsel for the appellant / defendant would submit in his argument that the first
appellate court had without any reasons interfered in the judgment of the trial court. He would
further submit that the lease in between the parties even though unregistered was admitted and
accordingly, it commenced from month to month and after the lapse of tenancy period, the tenant
continues to be in possession of the said property as tenant by holding over. He would further
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163872472/ 3L.C.Saptharishi vs E.D.Balasubramanian on 28 March, 2012
submit that the said tenancy was admittedly commencing from 29th of every English Calendar
month and was ending with 28th of the next succeeding month and accordingly, it commenced
firstly on 29.11.1984. He would further submit that the appellant / tenant continues to be in
possession of the suit property even after the expiry of lease period. He would also submit that the
lease existing in between the parties was said to have been terminated by the issuance of a notice
under Section 106 of Transfer of Property Act and it was not issued in accordance with the
provisions of Section 106 of Transfer of Property Act. He would further submit that the tenancy
being month to month, the ingredients of the said notice terminating the tenancy was not strictly
given in accordance with the provisions, viz., to terminate tenancy ending with the Calendar month
and 15 days time limit to vacate the premises. He would further submit that the tenancy was
terminated by the end of 29.11.1990 and it was not given as ending with the month of November. He
would further submit that the amendment of Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act through the
Amendment Act would not apply to the present case, since the tenancy was said to have been
terminated even prior to the implementation of the said amendment in the Act. He would also
submit that the said amendment was not retrospective, but was prospective nature. He would
further submit that the first appellate court had applied the amended provisions of Section 106 of
Transfer of Property Act and found that the tenancy was validly terminated, which are not correct,
since the unamended Section 106 of Transfer of Property Act is only applicable to the present case.
He would also submit in his argument that the vested right accrued to the appellant/tenant under
the provisions of Section 106 of Transfer of Property Act shall not be taken away by virtue of the
amendment of Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. He would cite a judgment of the Hon'ble
Apex Court reported in AIR 1965 SC 1970 (Amireddy Raja Gopala Rao and others ..vs. Amireddi
Sitharamamma and others) for the principle that any statute has to be interpreted so as to respect
the vested rights. He would, therefore, submit in his argument that the said amended provisions
would not apply to the present case in view of the transitory provisions laid down in the Amendment
Act. He would cite a judgment of this Court reported in 2008 (4) LW 486 (S.Samy ..vs.. Valliammal)
in support of his argument. He would also draw the attention of the Court to a judgment of this
Court reported in AIR 2009 NOC 2695 (MAD) (Mohamed Ismail and another ..vs.. Thiruthani
Lakshmi Ammal) in support of his case. He would also bring it to the notice of this Court a judgment
reported in AIR 2006 Bombay 321 (Allahabad Bank ..vs.. Prakash Shankar Wagh) for the same
principle. He would further submit in his arguments that the appellant / tenant had expended much
for keeping the cylinders in the tenanted premises by levelling the ground and the said circumstance
should also be considered while passing any order. He would further submit that the first appellate
court did not consider the effect of amendment made in Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act,
but had applied the said amendment to the present case and passed an order of ejectment, which is
not sustainable. Therefore, he would request the Court to interfere with the judgment and decree
passed by the first appellate court and to set aside the same and thereby, dismiss the suit filed by the
respondent / plaintiff. Thus, the Second Appeal may be allowed.
11. The learned counsel for the respondent/plaintiff would submit in his argument that the tenancy
admittedly commenced from 29.11.1984 and was ending with the next month viz., 28.12.1984 and
thereafter, continued ending with the 28th day of every next month and the notice to quit under
Section 106 of Transfer of Property Act was issued by the plaintiff with 15 days clear notice ending
with 28.11.1990 and the said notice was produced as Ex.A3, to which the defendant replied through
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163872472/ 4L.C.Saptharishi vs E.D.Balasubramanian on 28 March, 2012
Ex.A4. He would also submit that the reply in Ex.A4 dated 21.11.1990 would go to show that the
notice of termination in Ex.A3 was received sufficiently earlier on 31.10.1990 and more than 15 days
was available to vacate the premises by the end of 28.11.1990. He would also submit that the
defendant had admitted the commencement of tenancy by every 29th day of English Calendar
month and was ending with 28th day of next succeeding English Calendar month. He would further
submit that the original construction of Section 106 of Transfer of Property Act would envisage that
the notice to quit must be given by the end of the tenancy month with clear 15 days and therefore,
the notice sent in Ex.A3 was quite valid and the first appellate court had found so and set aside the
judgment of the trial court, which misconstrued the evidence and the provisions of Section 106 of
the Transfer of Property Act. He would also submit that even otherwise the amendment of Section
106 of the Transfer of Property Act would be helpful, since after amendment, the provision of
Section 106 of Transfer of Property Act has been relaxed by stating that for a lease of month to
month, termination may be done by issuing 15 days notice. He would also submit that there is no
necessity for the termination date shall be ending with the end of the tenancy month. He would also
submit that the argument advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant / tenant that the
amended Section 106 of Transfer of Property Act would not apply to the present case, is not correct
in this case and even otherwise, the said amended provision of Section 106 of the Transfer of
Property Act is applicable in view of the transitory provision in Section 3 of the Amendment Act. He
would further submit in his arguments that a close reading of the said provision in Section 3 of the
Act would show that the termination notice issued prior to the amendment can be made applicable
with the amended provisions of Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, if the suit filed thereon
is pending at the commencement of the Amendment Act. He would also submit that the judgments
cited by the learned counsel for the appellant would also be helpful to the plaintiff, since the suit as
well as the appeal suit pending before the first appellate court were in vogue on the date of
commencement of the Transfer of Property (Amendment) Act, 2002 (3 of 2003), viz., 31.12.2002.
He would also submit that the appeal suit is the continuance of the original suit and therefore, the
provisions in Section 3(a) of the Transfer of Property (Amendment) Act, 2002 (3 of 2003) would
apply to the present case. He would also submit that the improvement stated to have been effected
by the tenant in the premises would have no relevance in this case, since the tenant had used the
premises as a vacant site for storing the gas cylinders. He would also submit in his argument that
the finding of the first appellate court is perfectly in order and in accordance with law and there is
no necessity to interfere with the findings reached by the first appellate court. He would therefore,
request the Court to dismiss the Second Appeal.
12. I have given anxious thoughts to the arguments advanced on either side.
13. The suit has been filed for the following reliefs:-
a) to quit and deliver vacant possession of the suit property to the plaintiff;
b) directing the defendant to pay Rs.2933/- towards damages for use and occupation
from 29.11.1990 to 21.12.1990 for 23 days at the rate of Rs.4000/-;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163872472/ 5L.C.Saptharishi vs E.D.Balasubramanian on 28 March, 2012
c) to pay the damage for use and occupation at Rs.4000/- per month from the date of
plaint till the date of delivery of the possession of the suit property;
d) to pay the cost of the suit.
14. No doubt the suit was dismissed except for the relief of damages. At the time of disposal of the
suit on 23.08.2000, the Transfer of Property (Amendment) Act, 2002 (3 of 2003) was not in
existence and it was implemented on and from 31.12.2002. Therefore, the unamended provisions of
Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act was applied by the learned trial Judge and a decision was
reached. Thereafter, the appeal was filed by the plaintiff against the said judgment and decree, in
A.S.No.307 of 2001 and it was disposed only on 31.12.2003. In the meanwhile, the Transfer of
Property (Amendment) Act, 2002 (3 of 2003) to amend Section 106 of Transfer of Property Act
came into force on and from 31.12.2002. The first appellate court had considered the amendment of
Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act and had reversed the finding reached by the trial court
and thus, the suit was decreed.
15. According to the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant/tenant, the amended
provisions of Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act are not applicable to the present case. For
that, he has relied upon the judgment of this Court reported in 2008 (4) LW 486 cited supra and
AIR 2009 NOC 2695 (MAD) cited supra. However, he would also rely upon the judgment of the
Hon'ble Apex Court reported in AIR 1965 SC 1970 cited supra. The relevant passage relied upon by
the appellant would be as follows:-
"A statute has to be interpreted, if possible, so as to respect vested rights, and if the
words are open to another construction, such a construction should never be
adopted."
Relying upon the said judgment, it has been argued that the amendment of Section 106 of the
Transfer of Property Act cannot be taken as retrospective for the notices issued prior to the date of
amendment of the said provision. However, it was retracted by the learned counsel for the
respondent / plaintiff that the transitory provision in Section 3 of the Transfer of Property
(Amendment) Act, 2002 (3 of 2003) is very clear and therefore, the legislation would prevail when
specific provision has been made towards the application of Amendment Act.
16. This court had come to a conclusion in 2008 (4) LW 486 cited supra that the transitory
provisions are to be followed when the applicability of provisions of Section 106 of the Transfer of
Property Act is in dispute. For that, "Section 3 - Transitory Provision" has been extracted, which
would run as follows:-
"3. Transitory Provision :-
The provisions of Section 106 of the principal Act, as amended by Section 2, shall
apply to -
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163872472/ 6L.C.Saptharishi vs E.D.Balasubramanian on 28 March, 2012
(a) all notices in pursuance of which any suit or proceeding is pending at the
commencement of this Act; and
(b) all notices which have been issued before the commencement of this Act, but
where no suit or proceeding has been filed before such commencement".
According to the aforesaid provision, the notices sent prior to the amendment and if any suit is filed
on the basis of such notice and is pending at the commencement of the Amendment Act, Section
3(a) of the said Act which amended Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act shall apply. The said
provision would also mean that when the suit is pending at the time of implementation of the
Transfer of Property (Amendment) Act, 2002 (3 of 2003), the amended provision would apply.
17. As regards the present case, the notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act in Ex.A3
was issued on 21.10.1990 and it was received by the defendant on 31.10.1990, in which the
termination of lease was done by the end of tenancy month ending with 28.11.1990. Therefore, I
could see that 15 days notice has been clearly given from the date of receipt of the notice till the date
of termination viz., 28.11.1990.
18. The suit, even though, disposed of by the trial court on 23.08.2000, the appeal preferred by the
plaintiff in A.S.No.307 of 2001 was pending before the first appellate court on the date of
implementation of the said Act, viz., 31.12.2002. It is a settled law that when an appeal has been
filed against any judgment and decree passed in Original Suit, the said Original Suit is deemed to
have been pending as the appeal is nothing but an extension of the Original Suit. Therefore, it could
be easily construed that the suit was pending when the Amendment Act was enforced on 31.12.2002.
According to the transitory provision, the amended provision of Section 106 of Transfer of Property
Act is made applicable to the pending proceedings, namely, the appeal suit before the first appellate
court. Therefore, the argument advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant / tenant that the
amended provision of Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act would not apply to the present
case can not hold any water.
19. Even otherwise, if the amendment is not applied to the present case, the tenancy month as
agreed in between the parties would be commencing from 29.11.1984 and was ending with
28.12.1984 and thereafter to continue so on. This has been candidly admitted by the defendant even
in the grounds of this appeal. The original notice of termination in Ex.A3 was issued terminating the
tenancy by the end of 28.11.1990 with the demand to hand over vacant possession on 29.11.1990. No
doubt, the tenancy month in between the parties ends on 28th day of every English Calendar month
and therefore, the termination of tenancy ending with 28.11.1990 was quite valid. The
acknowledgement card produced in Ex.A5 was received by the defendant on 31.10.1990. It was also
replied by the defendant through Ex.A4 dated 21.11.1990. From the date of receipt of the said notice,
viz., 31.10.1990, there was more than 15 days to vacate the premises on 29.11.1990. Therefore, the
unamended provisions of Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act was also complied with by the
plaintiff. However, the trial court had deliberately misconstrued the said evidence and was reluctant
to decree the suit for ejectment. The first appellate court had promptly interfered with the mistake
committed by the trial court and had corrected it by decreeing the suit.

20. Viewed from any angle, I could see that the judgment and decree passed by the first appellate
court was delivered after considering the evidence and came to the conclusion in a correct
perspective. For the foregoing discussions, the questions of law framed are decided against the
appellant. Therefore, I do not find any reason to interfere with the judgment and decree passed by
the first appellate court.
21. For the foregoing discussion, I am of the considered view that the judgment and decree passed
by the first appellate court is not liable to be interfered and therefore, it is confirmed and the Second
Appeal preferred by the appellant / defendant is dismissed with costs. Time for vacating the
premises is four months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
