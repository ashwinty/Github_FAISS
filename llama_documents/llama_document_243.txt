OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.1 of 47
2. The facts leading to this petition are that on 11.11.2014, respondent, a partnership firm, a small
scale unit, registered with NSIC got a supply order from the Director General, CP Cell, Sena Bhawan
under the Ministry of Defence for fabricating and supplying 1,75,939 nos. of shirts men's cotton
Cellular 1973 pattern (modified) Khaki @ 168/- each for a total value of Rs. 2,95,57,752/-. In terms
of Clause 6 Part I of the supply order, respondent was required to submit 2 Nos. of shirts as advance
sample to the Controller, CQA (T & C), Kanpur within 45 days from the date of issue of supply order
for test and approval before commencing the bulk manufacturing of the shirts. In terms of Clause 1
(a) Part IV of the Supply order, it was also required to furnish a performance bank guarantee for a
sum equivalent to 10% of the value of the supply order within 30 days.
The respondent submitted two number of shirts as advance sample to the inspecting authority on
18.12.2014 but it could not furnish the performance bank guarantee within 30 days. It requested the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49965147/ 1Union Of India vs Sureka International on 14 July, 2022
petitioner vide letter dated 22.12.2014 to extend the date or deduct the amount from its first bill.
The petitioner instead vide letter dated 23.12.2014 issued a show cause notice directing the
respondent to furnish the guarantee by 31.12.2014 failing which, the supply order will be cancelled
at risk and cost of the respondent without any further notice and the amount is also likely to be
deducted from bills of other supply OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page
No.2 of 47 orders (if any) placed on its firm at the time of cancellation. In the meanwhile, inspecting
authority approved the sample. The respondent also furnished the guarantee on 16.05.2015 vide
FDR No. 586870 for Rs. 29,55,775/- drawn on Allahabad Bank, Kanpur, UP.
3. In terms of the supply order, petitioner was required to re-fix the delivery period but the
petitioner, instead vide letter dated 23.06.2015 with its copy to the Director General of Supplies and
Disposals and NSIC, alleged that the respondent has submitted a forged bank guarantee. NSIC on
receipt of the letter, also sought clarification on this issue vide letter dated 03.07.2015 which the
respondent responded vide letter dated 09.07.2015 explaining that the alleged forged bank
guarantee was never submitted by it. It was submitted that all the bank guarantees which are
submitted by them are forwarded with the forwarding letter signed by company's Managing Director
and none else. It would like to verify the signatures on the alleged bank guarantee forwarding letter.
It also enclosed certified copy of the Partnership Deed, Sales Tax Registration Certificate,
registration of commercial tax as well as the lease deed in the name of the respondent bearing the
signatures of the Managing Director. It was also stated that due to temporary absence of its
Managing Partner during the period, it could not counter/furnish timely contradiction to its letter
dated 09.03.2015 regarding alleged submission of bank guarantee. It OMP Comm No. 100/2020
UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.3 of 47 also requested the petitioner to provide the copy of
forged bank guarantee so that it could investigate on its own end but the petitioner did not respond
and forfeited the FDR.
4. Feeling aggrieved by the action of the petitioner in forfeiting Rs. 29,55,775/- which it had
deposited in lieu of PBG through FDR, it filed a writ petition in the Hon'ble High Court of
Allahabad, UP, which was disposed of vide order dated 04.08.2015 with the observations that the
findings of facts can only be recorded after oral and documentary evidence adduced by the parties
which is possible in a civil suit. The petitioner (respondent herein) may file a suit before the
appropriate forum for redressal of its grievances which it has raised in the writ petition. However, in
view of the arbitration clause, the petitioner (respondent herein) can always approach before the
respondents (petitioners herein) for settlement. The respondent then filed a Civil Suit no.
2336/2015 before the Civil Judge, Kanpur but it, on the advice of the counsel, withdrew it with
liberty to get the matter settled through arbitration. In the Civil Suit, it had filed an affidavit that it
has discussed the subject matter with the counsel of Union of India who advised him to solve the
disputes through arbitration to which, it has agreed which also has a reference in the order of the
Civil Judge dated 31.05.2018. The respondent before initiating the arbitration had also requested
the petitioner vide letter dated 03.10.2015 to withdraw the cancellation letter and re-fix the delivery
period.
OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.4 of 47 It thereafter, in terms of
Clause 3 of Part III of the Supply order, sent a legal notice dated 19.05.2017 to the petitioner either
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49965147/ 2Union Of India vs Sureka International on 14 July, 2022
to refund the amount or refer the dispute to arbitration. It was followed by a reminder dated
08.07.2015 but the petitioner neither refunded the amount nor referred the matter to arbitration.
The respondent then filed a petition under Section 11 of the Act for appointment of an arbitrator
which was allowed by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court vide order dated 20.03.2015. Sh. B.S Chumbak
was appointed as the Sole Arbitrator. He entered upon reference on 23.05.2019 and called upon the
parties to file their statements. The respondent filed statement of claim for refund of the amount of
FDR with interest alleging that it never backed out from its contractual commitments, it had
submitted the advance samples to the petitioner as per the contract which were duly approved by
the inspecting authority and that the petitioner was contractually bound to re-fix the delivery
period. It also clarified in its letter dated 25.06.2015 that it never submitted any forged bank
guarantee as alleged but the petitioner without any notice and without granting any opportunity of
hearing, debarred it for one year from participation in any tender in future vide letter dated
29.07.2015. It also cancelled the supply order alleging fraud on its part in terms of para 1 (a) of Part
IV of the supply order read with Part 6.12.1 (b) and 10.10.1 (b) of DPM-2009. It was stated that it
had deposited the guarantee in the form of FDR thus fulfilled its contractual obligation. Since
advance samples were OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.5 of 47
already approved, submission of bank guarantee no longer remained the essence of the contract.
There were no circumstances justifying for invoking Clause 1 (a) of Part IV of the contract. It was
stated that the petitioner should have waited for the outcome of the investigation qua the alleged
forged PBG and its action for banning it or cancelling the contract was premature and premeditated.
It was also stated that in terms of Section 15 and 16 of MSME Act, petitioner is liable to pay
compound interest on the amount illegally forfeited.
5. The petitioner in response to the claim petition, referred the terms and conditions contained in
part III and part IV of the supply order and alleged that the respondent did not deposit the PBG
within the time stipulated. It was stated that only on receipt of letters dated 10.12.2014 and
23.12.2014, respondent submitted the PBG dated 03.03.2015 which on scrutiny was found forged
and fake by the Bank Manager vide his letter dated 26.03.2015. In the meantime, respondent
furnished FDR of Allahabad Bank, Kanpur on 16.05.2015. It was stated that a complaint was lodged
at the police station Sansad Marg on 12.06.2015 and a letter dated 23.06.2015 was also sent to
DGQA, New Delhi to debar the respondent from further participating in the tender process and for
cancelling the supply order which was cancelled vide letter dated 30.06.2015. NSIC also de-listed
the respondent vide its letter dated 28.09.2015 for one year. It was alleged that the respondent
breached the terms OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.6 of 47 and
conditions of the supply order.
6. In rejoinder, it was submitted by the respondent that in a similar case of mattresses 'Kapok', there
were allegations of submission of fake and forged PBG and the petitioner later on had accepted the
FDR. It though cancelled the contract but released the FDR on the ground that it had no case to
forfeit FDR.
7. The arbitrator on the pleadings, framed the following issues.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49965147/ 3Union Of India vs Sureka International on 14 July, 2022
i. Whether Performance Bank Guarantee issued by Oriental Bank of Commerce, 914, The Mall,
Kanpur dated 03.03.2015 was forged, if so, its effect? OPR.
ii. Whether the claimant (respondent herein) is entitled for refund of the sum of Rs. 29,55,775/-
deposited by him towards Performance Bank Guarantee pursuant to the terms and conditions
mentioned in the contract executed between the claimant and the respondent (petitioner herein)?
OPD.
iii. Whether the respondent no.2 is entitled to forfeit a sum of Rs. 29,55,775/- deposited by the
claimant as Performance Bank Guarantee through the FDR dated 16.05.2015 vide receipt no.
586870 issued by Allahabad Bank, (70), 15/287, Civil Lines, Post Box No. 2, Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh?
OPR.
iv. Whether the claimant has breached the terms and OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha
International Page No.7 of 47 conditions of the contract, if so, its effect? OPR.
v. Whether the claimant is entitled to claim cost of proceedings and interest on the security amount
deposited by the claimant firm as Performance Bank Guarantee through the FDR?OPC.
vi. Whether the respondent has rightly cancelled the contract executed between the claimant and the
respondent? OPR.
vii. Relief.
8. Respondent examined Sh. Ashok Sureka as CW-1. Petitioner examined Lt. Col. Rajender Singh,
CP Cell as RW-1.
The arbitrator after hearing the parties, gave issue wise findings holding that the allegations of
criminal wrong or statutory violation would not detract the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal to
resolve a dispute arising out of a contractual relationship on the basis of jurisdiction conferred by
the arbitration clause provided in the supply order. He rejected the contention of the petitioner that
the issue involved in the matter is incapable of settlement through arbitration (issue no.1).
On issue no. 2, 3 and 4, he held that the respondent is entitled for the refund.
On issue no.6, he held that the act of the petitioner to cancel the supply order/contract on the face of
it appears to be premeditated, arbitrary, unlawful and not tenable in law. The OMP Comm No.
100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.8 of 47 petitioner failed to prove that it rightly
cancelled the contract.
On issue no.5, he discussed Section 31 (7) and 31 (A) of the Act and Section 15 and 16 of MSME Act,
2006 and held that the respondent being SSI Unit was unnecessarily put to litigation. It has not
violated any terms and conditions of the supply order rather, it was the petitioner who illegally
cancelled the contract on the non existing grounds and forfeited the amount of FDR.

9. The petitioner challenged the award alleging that the subject stores i.e. men's cotton shirts were
required for the troops/soldiers of the Indian Army i.e. Defence Forces for whom timely action was
the topmost priority. Any illegality/cancellation not only affects the ordinance department including
soldiers/troops but also affects the entire nation as the security of the Nation depends on them. It is
stated that the dispute in respect to forged and fabricated bank guarantee could only be decided by
recording oral/documentary evidence which was possible only in a civil suit and the arbitrator had
no jurisdiction to decide the said dispute which was also held by the Hon'ble High Court of
Allahabad, which order was not challenged by any of the parties. It is stated that the respondent had
filed the civil suit before the Civil Judge, Kanpur but it withdrew the suit and took recourse to the
arbitration, which is against the settled law and the directions contained in the writ petition. This
question was also raised by the petitioner before OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha
International Page No.9 of 47 the arbitrator that such like disputes cannot be referred to arbitration
referring the cases, A. Ayyasamy v/s A. Paramasivam and Others (2016) 10 SCC 386, Bharat
Rasiklal v/s Gautam Rasiklal, (2012) 2 SCC 144, Radhakrishnan v/s Maestro Engineers, 2010 1 SCC
72, Abdul Qadir v/s Madhav Prabhakar, AIR 1962 SC 406 and Oomor Sait HG v/s Asiam Sait, 2001
(3) CTC 269, but the arbitrator wrongly held that the allegation of criminal wrong or statutory
violation would not detract the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal to resolve a dispute arising out of
a contractual relationship on the basis of jurisdiction conferred by the arbitration clause provided in
the supply order.
10. It is stated that above finding is patently illegal being not only against the order of Hon'ble High
Court of Allahabad in the writ petition but also against the settled law of the land. The arbitrator
failed to explain how the act of the respondent amounts to the mere allegation of fraud. It is stated
that the petitioner had brought sufficient evidences qua the respondent having been committed the
criminal act of furnishing forged, fabricated and frivolous bank guarantee which is not only a crime
against the government including the soldiers/troops but also against the bank whose name was
used in the guarantee. It is stated that because of the criminal act, respondent was banned for a
period of one year from participating in the future tender enquiries. It is stated that the contract
cannot be OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.10 of 47
performed/concluded on the basis of forged and fabricated guarantee. When the bank guarantee
clause was agreed by the parties, then in the case of breach, whether or not actual loss or damage
was proved, the party was liable to pay the amount of the bank guarantee. It is stated that Section 74
of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 is applicable in the present case. The purpose of furnishing bank
guarantee is that the bank on behalf of the party undertakes/guarantees that in case, the goods are
not supplied as per the contract, the bank shall cover up the losses upto the maximum limit as
provided in the guarantee. It is stated that the contract was required to be executed in its letter &
spirit. It is stated that the fixed deposit was rightly forfeited by the petitioner as per the contract.
11. It is stated that the loss to the petitioner cannot be quantified and calculated in terms of the
money. The petitioner had no other option but to forfeit the bank guarantee in the form of FDR to
compensate to some extent. In a contract where bank guarantee clause was agreed as pre-estimated
loss to cover/compensate the actual losses, the petitioner is not required to prove the loss. Reference
is made of the case, ONGC v/s Saw Pipes Ltd, CA No. 7419 of 2001, Ministry of Defence,
Government of India v/s Cenrex Sp. Z.O.O and Ors, OMP NO. 408/2007, decided on 08.12.2015,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49965147/ 5Union Of India vs Sureka International on 14 July, 2022
Tamil Nadu Telecommunications v/s BSNL, OMP (Comm)- 430/2016 decided on 11.11.2016. It is
stated that in view of above OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.11 of
47 proposition of law, the respondent is not entitled to refund the sum deposited by it towards the
performance bank guarantee pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the supply order.
12. It is stated that the arbitrator instead making the parties clear about his fee increased his fee
gradually though he was supposed to charge as per law. Reference is made of the case Chandok
Machineries v/s SN Sunderson and Co, decided on 28.08.2018 in OMP (Comm) No. 321/2017.
13. Notice of the petition was given to the respondent. It filed the reply denying the averments made
in the petition.
14. I have heard ld. Counsel Sh. Ashish Kumar Sharma for the petitioner and Sh. Raghav Parwatiyar,
ld. Counsel for the respondent.
15. Ld. Counsel for the petitioner reiterated what has been stated in the petition. He contended that
the arbitrator could not have decided the forgery issue which was raised in the matter. The
respondent had submitted a forged and fabricated bank guarantee. On suspect, petitioner got the
bank guarantee verified from the bank which was found forged. It immediately wrote to the
respondent and lodged the police complaint. It cancelled the contract because the stores related to
the supply OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.12 of 47 for the
soldiers/troops. Ld. Counsel contended that in the writ petition, it was clearly held that the dispute
could only be decided by leading oral/documentary evidences in a civil suit. The respondent had
filed a civil suit but later, it withdrew the suit and invoked the arbitration. Ld. Counsel stated that
the bank guarantee was rightly forfeited following the terms and conditions contained in the supply
order.
16. Ld. Counsel contended that there is a patent illegality in the impugned award which needs be set
aside. Reference is made of the cases (supra) to contend that the complaint was lodged at the police
station Sansad Marg on 12.06.2015. After filing the complaint, several reminders/requests were
made to the police but petitioner did not get any response from there. Requests were also sent to the
Higher Authorities. Matter was also followed up with NSIC who de-listed the respondent for a
period of one year w.e.f. 28.09.2015. Ld. Counsel stated that later, the same material was purchased
by placing a supply order to another firm namely SR Enterprises under risk and purchase.
17. Ld. Counsel for the respondent per contra argued that the samples were submitted to the
petitioner within time as per Clause 6 part II of the supply order which samples were approved by
the Inspecting Authorities. It had furnished the bank guarantee in the form of FDR of the like
amount which OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.13 of 47 was duly
accepted by the petitioner on 16.05.2015 but the petitioner failed to re-fix delivery proved as per
Clause 3 part II of the supply order though it was duty bound. Ld. Counsel stated that the petitioner
failed to prove before the arbitrator that furnishing of PBG was the essence of contract or the
respondent had submitted the alleged forged PBG. Ld. Counsel stated that except filing a police
complaint, the petitioner did not pursue any action against the respondent with regard to alleged
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49965147/ 6Union Of India vs Sureka International on 14 July, 2022
forged PBG. Ld. Counsel stated that the objection is primarily based on the ground that arbitration
was not maintainable since there were allegations of forgery against the respondent. Ld. Counsel
contended that this ground was dealt/looked into by the Hon'ble High Court at the time of
appointing the arbitrator and therefore, the petitioner cannot be allowed to re-agitate this issue on
the principle of estoppal, waiver and acquiescence. Ld. Counsel stated that the petitioner never
objected the respondent from withdrawing the civil suit which was filed prior to the commencement
of the arbitral proceedings nor challenged the order of Hon'ble High Court in the Arb. Petition no.
696/17.
18. Ld. Counsel contended that submission of forged PBG by the respondent was merely an
allegation which had no substance. The respondent had denied having submitted the alleged forged
PBG. Further, petitioner has failed to prove that respondent had submitted the alleged forged PBG.
Ld. Counsel stated that the OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.14 of
47 dispute between the parties is of civil nature. The allegation of fraud imputed by the petitioner
does not make the contract void ab initio. Ld. Counsel referred the case of Vidya Drolia and Ors v/s
Durga Trading Corporation, C.A No. 2402 of 2019, decided on 14.12.2020 to contend that the
allegation can be made a subject matter of arbitration when it relates to a civil dispute subject to a
caveat that the fraud which vitiates and invalidates the arbitration clause is an aspect relating to
non-arbitrability. Ld. Counsel contended that neither DPM 2009 7.7.1 nor part 4 of the supply order
gives right to the petitioner to cancel the contract at the risk and expense of the respondent. In the
supply order, it was nowhere provided that due to non filing of PBG within the stipulated
period/extended period, the petitioner would forfeit the amount of the bank guarantee. Ld. Counsel
stated that the liquidated damage clause provides the circumstances under which PBG could be
encashed and in the clause, there is nothing to take the bond outside the usual commercial
understanding. It is provided in the article that if there is failure to deliver any installment of goods
within the date specified, the amount of PBG can be encashed/adjusted towards the losses suffered
by the petitioner. Since in the instant case, date of delivery was not re-fixed after the approval of the
samples so the factum of supplying the goods within the stipulated period never arose and therefore,
claim of damage/right of forfeiting the FDR never arose in favour of the petitioner. Ld. Counsel
referred sub clause of part III of the OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page
No.15 of 47 Supply order which provided that in the event of seller's failure to submit the
bond/guarantee/document as specified in the supply order, the buyer may at its discretion withhold
any payment until the completion of supply order or can deduct from the seller as agreed a
liquidated damage at 0.15% of the supply order price for the delayed/undelivered store for every
week of delay or part of a week subject to a maximum value of the liquidated damage being not more
than 10% of the value of the delayed stores. Ld. Counsel stated that sub clause 9 of Part III only
provides for the reasons for termination of the supply order and in no terms, for not furnishing the
PBG, the supply order could be cancelled/terminated. Ld. Counsel stated that vide letter dated
09.03.2015, petitioner had extended the period for furnishing the PBG. Ld. Counsel stated that
purpose of PBG as mentioned in the supply order was to supply the goods as per the contract. Ld.
Counsel stated that after the approval of samples, the respondent had furnished the amount of PBG
in the form of FDR which was duly accepted by the petitioner. It was therefore the duty of the
petitioner to re-fix the delivery period which it failed to do. Ld. Counsel stated that it is not the case
that the respondent failed to furnish the PBG within the specified time.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49965147/ 7Union Of India vs Sureka International on 14 July, 2022
19. Ld. Counsel stated that in the letter dated 09.03.2015, petitioner never informed the respondent
that the PBG was forged. It had merely said that PBG is not in accordance with OMP Comm No.
100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.16 of 47 the format and it suffers from
discrepancy. It was interalia stated that the bond is not as per the format, it does not bear any
number of issuing bank, it indicates two figures but the correct figure is Rs. 29,55,775/- etc. The
respondent vide letter dated 18.03.2015 submitted that it is ready to deposit the FDR of the amount.
Ld. Counsel stated that allegation of submission of forged PBG is a mere allegation and has no
serious implications in the interse relationship between the parties. Further, acceptance of FDR of
the like amount by the petitioner would operate as estoppal against the petitioner. Ld. Counsel
stated that the respondent never committed the breach and was entitled for the refund of the
security amount. Ld. Counsel stated that acceptance of FDR, extension of time for submission of
PBG and provision of penalty on failure to submit PBG would negate the contention that submission
of PBG on or before 23.12.2014 was the essence of the contract. Reference is made of the case, Hind
Constructions v/s State of Maharashtra, 1979 AIR 720 SC, to contend that whether time is the
essence of contract is a question of intention of the parties, to be gathered from the contract and the
provision for imposition of penalty and extension of time would militate such an inference.
20. Ld. Counsel stated that there is no infirmity/illegality in the impugned award.
21. I have given my thoughtful consideration to the rival OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs.
Surekha International Page No.17 of 47 contentions, perused the award, documents placed with the
award and the case laws (supra) referred by the parties.
Findings / adjudication:
22. The impugned award was passed on 13.05.2020. This petition under Section 34 of the Act has
been filed on 28.11.2020.
23. Section 34 (3) of the Act provides a limitation period of three months for filing objections against
an arbitral award. Proviso to Section 34 (3) of the Act provides an extended period of 30 days for
filing the application and the court has the discretion to condone the delay, provided sufficient cause
is shown by the party which prevented it from approaching the court in the limitation period of
three months. In the case of DDA v/s Durga Construction, (2013) SCC Online Del 4451, it was held
that although the courts have the jurisdiction to condone the delay, the approach in exercising such
jurisdiction cannot be liberal and the conduct of the applicant will have to be tested on the anvil of
whether the applicant acted with due diligence and dispatch. The applicant would have to show that
the delay was on account of reasons beyond the control of applicant and could not be avoided
despite all possible efforts by the applicant.
24. The proviso to Section 34 (3) of the Act is similar to that of Section 5 of the Limitation Act. It
also relates to extension of period of limitation. In the instant case, there is delay of about OMP
Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.18 of 47 four months in filing the
petition but the Supreme Court in suo moto petition vide Writ Petition No. 03/2020 has extended
the limitation keeping in view the situation arisen out of Covid-19 Pandemic in India, which is also
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49965147/ 8Union Of India vs Sureka International on 14 July, 2022
applicable in the arbitral proceedings,
25. In view of the directions issued by the Supreme Court, I am of the view that this petition is
maintainable.
26. Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act reads as:
"34.Application for setting aside arbitral award- (1)Recourse to a court against an
arbitral award may be made only by an application for setting aside such award in
accordance with sub-section (2) and sub- section (3). (2)An arbitral award may be set
aside by the court only if-
(a) the party making the application furnishes proof that-
(i) a party was under some incapacity, or
(ii) the arbitration agreement is not valid under the law to which the parties have
subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law for the time being in
force; or
(iii) the party making the application was not given proper notice of the appointment
of an arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings or was otherwise unable to present his
case; or
(iv) the arbitral award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within
the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond
the scope of the submission to arbitration;
Provided that, if the decisions on matters submitted to arbitration can be separated from those not
so submitted, only that part of the arbitral award which contains decisions on matters not submitted
to arbitration may be set aside; or
(v) the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the
agreement of the parties, unless such agreement was in conflict with a OMP Comm No. 100/2020
UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.19 of 47 provision of this Part from which the parties cannot
derogate, or, failing such agreement, was not in accordance with this Part; or
(b) the court finds that-
(i) the subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration under the law for the
time being in force, or
(ii) the arbitral award is in conflict with the public policy of India.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49965147/ 9Union Of India vs Sureka International on 14 July, 2022
Explanation- I For the avoidance of any doubt, it is clarified that an award is in conflict with the
public policy of India only if the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption
or was in violation of Section 75 or Section 81."
ii) It is in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law;
iii) It is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice.
Explanation-II- For the avoidance of doubt, the test as to whether there is a contravention with the
fundamental policy of Indian law shall not entail a review on the merits of the dispute.
[2 (A) An arbitral award arising out of arbitrations other than international commercial arbitrations,
may also be set aside by the court, if the court finds that the award is vitiated by patent illegality
appearing on the face of the award: Provided that an award shall not be set aside merely on the
ground of an erroneous application of the law or by reappreciation of evidence.
27. Normally, the general principles are that the decision of the Arbitrator unless there is an error
apparent on the face of the award which makes it unsustainable, is not to be set aside even if the
court as a court of law would come to a different conclu- sion on the same facts. The court cannot
reappraise the evi- dence and it is not open to the court to sit in appeal over the OMP Comm No.
100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.20 of 47 conclusion of the arbitrator. It is not
open to the court to set aside a finding of fact arrived at by the arbitrator and only grounds on which
the award can be cancelled are those men- tioned in the Arbitration Act. Where the arbitrator
assigns co- gent grounds and sufficient reasons and no error of law or mis- conduct is cited, the
award will not call for interference by the court in the exercise of the power vested in it.
28. In the case of Associate Builders v/s Delhi Development Au-
thority, (2015) 3 SCC 49, it was held that interference with an arbitral award is
permissible only when the findings of the arbi- trator are arbitrary, capricious or
perverse or when conscience of the Court is shocked or when illegality is not trivial
but goes to the root of the matter. The arbitrator is ultimately a master of the quantity
and quality of evidence while drawing the arbitral award. Patent illegality must go to
the root of the matter and cannot be of trivial nature.
29. In Ssangyong Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. vs. National Highways Authority of India Ltd.
2019 SCC OnLine SC 677, the Supreme Court has held that under Section 34 of the Act, a decision
which is perverse while no longer being a ground for challenge under public policy of India but
would certainly amount to a patent illegality appearing on the face of the award. A finding based on
the documents taken behind the OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page
No.21 of 47 back of the parties by the arbitrator would also qualify as a decision based on no
evidence inasmuch as such decision is not based on evidence led by the parties and therefore would
also have to be characterized as perverse.

30. It is not in dispute that the respondent, a small scale unit registered with NSIC got a supply
order from the petitioner for fabricating/supplying of 175939 no. of shirts for a total value of Rs,
2,95,57,752/-. In terms of Clause 6 Part 1 of the Supply order, it had submitted two shirts as advance
sample to the Controller CQA (TNC), Kanpur within 45 days from the date of issue of supply order
for test. The inspecting authority approved the sample and the petitioner had to re-fix the delivery
period.
31. As per Clause 1 (a) Part IV of the Supply order, the respondent was required to furnish a
performance guarantee by way of bank guarantee/FDR to conduct the business for a sum equal to
10% of the supply order i.e. Rs. 29,55,775/- value within 30 days of signing the supply order which
would be valid upto 60 days beyond the date of warranty. In the instant case, the respondent had
requested the petitioner vide letter dated 22.12.2014 to extend the date for furnishing the bank
guarantee which it could not furnish within the time specified or to deduct the amount of the bank
guarantee from its bill but the petitioner, issued a show cause notice dated 23.12.2014 to the
respondent OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.22 of 47 directing it
to furnish the guarantee by 31.12.2014 failing which, supply order will be cancelled at risk and cost
of the respondent without any further notice and the amount would be deducted from the bills of
other supply orders placed on its firm at the time of cancellation. From the show cause notice, it is
clear that the petitioner had extended the time for furnishing the performance guarantee upto
31.12.2014.
32. According to the petitioner, the respondent had submitted a forged and fabricated bank
guarantee which was also confirmed by the Bank Manager. The version of the respondent was that it
never submitted the alleged forged bank guarantee. It had requested the petitioner to provide the
copy of the forged bank guarantee so that, it could investigate at its end but the petitioner did not
respond to its request. It instead, cancelled the supply order alleging fraud on the part of the
respondent and informed the Director General of Supplies and NISC. Record reveals that NISC had
sought clarification from the respondent on this issue which it promptly responded reiterating what
it had explained to the petitioner. The petitioner then debarred the respondent for one year from
participating in any of its tender in future vide letter dated 29.07.2015. It also lodged criminal
complaint at the police station, Sansad Marg with regard to submission of alleged forged bank
guarantee.
33. In the instant case, the respondent on 16.05.2015, had OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs.
Surekha International Page No.23 of 47 submitted an FDR for a sum of Rs. 29,55,775/- which was
also accepted by the petitioner which it, encashed after the cancellation of the supply order on the
ground of alleged fraud. The respondent had challenged the action of the petitioner by filing a Writ
Petition before the Hon'ble High Court of Allahabad which writ was disposed of vide order dated
04.08.2015 with the observations that the findings of facts can only be recorded after oral and
documentary evidence adduced by the parties which is possible in a Civil Suit. However, in view of
the arbitration clause, respondent can always approach before the petitioner for settlement. The
respondent then filed a Civil Suit before the Civil Judge, Kanpur but it withdrew the suit finding that
the supply order consisted of an arbitration clause for resolution of dispute between the parties. It
had filed an affidavit before the Civil Court that it had discussed the subject matter with the counsel
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49965147/ 11Union Of India vs Sureka International on 14 July, 2022
of Union of India who advised him to solve the disputes through arbitration to which, it agreed. The
respondent in terms of Clause 3 Part III of the Supply order then sent a legal notice dated
19.05.2017 to the petitioner either to refund the amount forfeited or refer the dispute to arbitration
but the petitioner did not take any action. The respondent then got the arbitrator appointed from
the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi vide order dated 20.03.2015 by filing a petition under Section 11 of
the Act.
34. On issue no. 1, the petitioner in the objections filed under OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs.
Surekha International Page No.24 of 47 Section 34 of the Act, has contended that the dispute in
regard to forged/fabricated bank guarantee could only be decided in a civil suit and the arbitrator
had no jurisdiction to decide the dispute referring the order of Hon'ble High Court of Allahabad but
the arbitrator wrongly held that the allegation of criminal wrong/statutory violation would not
detract the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal to resolve a dispute arising out of a contractual
relationship on the basis of the jurisdiction conferred by the arbitration clause.
35. I may mention that this issue was also raised by the petitioner in the petition under Section 11 of
the Act for appointment of the arbitrator. Hon'ble High Court in its order dated 20.03.2019
referring the orders of Ld. Civil Judge dated 23.04.2018, 28.04.2018 and 28.05.2018 held that a
perusal of these orders shows that the petitioner (respondent herein) withdrew the suit action. The
withdrawal application was supported by an affidavit in which the petitioner indicated that having
confabulated with the counsel for the UOI, the petitioner came to the conclusion that the best cause
of action would be to withdraw the suit and proceed to take action under the arbitration agreement.
It was also observed in para 24 of the order that the writ court had indicated to the petitioner that he
should either take recourse to a suit or an arbitral process. The court had also considered the
contention of the counsel for the respondent (petitioner herein) that while in the suit, reliefs were
OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.25 of 47 sought with regard to
the cancellation of letter dated 30.06.2015 but at this juncture, the respondent seeks refund of its
security deposit and it does not seek a direction that a status quo ante be maintained. It was held
that given the circumstances, he allows the petition and appoints an arbitrator as there is no dispute
as to the existence of the arbitration agreement.
36. A perusal of the arbitral record shows that the respondent had filed a statement of claim, the
petitioner had filed the statement of defence to which, the respondent had filed the rejoinder. The
arbitrator on the pleadings of the parties, framed the issues. The parties tendered their evidence by
calling their witnesses and exhibiting the documents. The arbitrator had also given opportunities to
the parties to cross examine the witnesses as evident from the proceedings/order dated 16.11.2019.
In this case, the arbitrator had conducted the proceedings like a Civil Court. He after hearing the
parties, passed the award recording the contentions of the parties referring the case laws. I failed to
understand what more was to be done by the Civil Court which was not done by the arbitrator in the
present case. The dispute was only to the extent of refund of the FDR amount which was forfeited by
the petitioner after cancelling the supply order. It is well settled legal position that all disputes
arising out of an agreement shall be referred to the arbitrator and when the dispute is referrable to
the arbitrator, the parties cannot be compelled to take recourse of civil proceedings.

OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.26 of 47
37. It is to note that in this case, the petitioner had lodged a complaint at the police station, Sansad
Marg in regard to the forged bank guarantee. Surprisingly, it did not seriously follow up the
complaint nor tried to find out who prepared the forged bank guarantee or at whose instance, it was
prepared. It assumes importance because the respondent, on getting notice, had denied having
submitted any forged bank guarantee with the petitioner. It had also asked the petitioner to provide
its copy so that it could investigate on its own end but the petitioner did not respond.
38. In the impugned award, the Arbitrator had referred the case of A. Ayyasamy v/s A. Paramsivam
and ors (supra) where it was held that mere allegation of fraud simplicitor may not be a ground to
nullify the effect of arbitration agreement between the parties. It is only in those cases where the
court while dealing with Section 8 of the Act finds that there are very serious allegations of fraud
which make a virtual case of criminal offence or where the allegations of fraud are so complicated
that it becomes absolutely essential that such complex issues be decided only by the Civil Court on
appreciation of voluminous evidence that needs to be produced.
The arbitrator taking recourse of the case (supra), has held that where there is simple allegation of
fraud touching the internal affairs of the parties and it has no implication in the OMP Comm No.
100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.27 of 47 public domain, the arbitration clause
need not be avoided and parties can be relegated to arbitration. The arbitrator referred Section 16 of
the Act and Section 8 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, in para 59 of the award has held that the
letter dated 09.03.2015 exhibited as Ex. RW-1/G finds mention that the bank guarantee bond in
question is not as per the format as provided in 1 (a) Part 1 of the Supply order r/w DPM-15, it does
not bear the number of issuing bank and it indicates two figures i.e. Rs. 29,35,775/- and Rs.
29,55,775/-. He held that this clearly indicates that the bank guarantee bond on the face of it was not
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the supply order. Further, respondent was given
time to deposit the amount of PBG as per the format by 20.03.2015 stating that extra time period
taken for submission of PBG after due date i.e. 10.12.2014 will be deducted while re-fixing of BPC.
He observed that FDR for the said amount was subsequently accepted by the petitioner in lieu of the
PBG, thus the said action of the petitioner would amount to acceptance of the performance of the
reciprocal condition of the supply order as provided under Section 8 of the Indian Contract Act. He
observed that on the one hand, the petitioner vide letter dated 10.08.2015 Ex.CW-1/C13 has
admitted that the case of furnishing fake PBG is under investigation and action will be taken on the
outcome but on the other hand, it already took the action by cancelling the supply order vide letter
dated 30.06.2015 Ex.RW-1/M which on the face of it, appears to be OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI
Vs. Surekha International Page No.28 of 47 arbitrary and unlawful taken without providing an
opportunity of being heard. He observed that the petitioner failed to bring on record any further
action taken by the investigating authority pursuant to the filing of complaint regarding the alleged
forged bank guarantee to the P.S Sansad Marg Ex.RW-1/L. In para 59
(ix), he observed:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49965147/ 13Union Of India vs Sureka International on 14 July, 2022
" In case the respondents are satisfied that claimant firm furnished a forged PBG or
that not furnished the PBG within the time agreed between the both parties, it will be
entitled to initiate such action as is contemplated under the agreement like cancelling
the contract or deduct the amount of PBG from the amount of first consignment to be
supplied by the claimant firm. If in that process any dispute arose between the
claimant and respondent the same shall have to be referred to the arbitration as
contemplated under clause 3 part III of Supply Order dated 11.11.2014."
39. He held that considering the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on the subject,
Section 5, 16 and 34 of the Act coupled with the fact that opportunity of hearing was not granted to
the respondent before cancelling the contract/debarring it from participating in future tender
enquiries as held in the case Erusion Equipment and Chemical Ltd v/s State of Bengal, (1975) 1 SCC
70, it is a fit case to be tried and adjudicated by the arbitral tribunal.
40. I do not find any reason to interfere in said observations. It cannot be said that it suffer from
patent illegality or the arbitrator went beyond the contract. He has correctly interpreted the terms of
the contract and the law and rightly held that the OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha
International Page No.29 of 47 allegation of criminal wrong doing or of statutory violation would
not detract the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal to resolve a dispute arising out of contractual
relationship on the basis of jurisdiction conferred by the arbitration clause provided in the supply
order.
41. In this case, the arbitrator has conducted the proceedings like a Civil Court giving due
opportunities to the parties to file documents, lead evidences on the documents/pleadings and
thereafter, he decided the issues on merits. This issue was also dealt in detail by the Hon'ble Delhi
High Court in the petition under Section 11 of the Act at the time of appointment of the arbitrator. It
was held in the case of Vidya Drolia and ors v/s Durga Trading Corporation (supra) that allegations
of fraud can be made a subject matter of arbitration when they relate to a civil dispute subject to the
caveat that the fraud which would vitiate or invalidate the arbitration clause, is an aspect relating to
non-arbitrability. In this case, the dispute which has been raised by the petitioner relates to a civil
dispute and in view of the judgment in the case of Vidya Drolia (supra), the allegation of fraud as
raised by the petitioner can be made a subject matter of arbitration which the arbitrator has rightly
allowed while deciding issue no.1.
42. Qua the findings on issue no.2, 3 and 4, it is not in dispute that after the approval of samples, the
petitioner was required to OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.30 of
47 re-fix the delivery period so that respondent could commence bulk manufacturing of the shirts.
In this case, supply order was issued on 11.11.2014. The respondent had submitted two shirts as
advance sample for inspection on 18.12.2014 i.e. within the stipulated period. The samples were
approved by inspecting authority on 22.01.2015. The supply order was cancelled on 30.06.2015. The
alleged forged bank guarantee was submitted on 03.03.2015 though the performance bank
guarantee should have been submitted by the respondent within 30 days from the date of issue of
the supply order. It had requested to extend the date of submission of PBG which was allowed.
Finally, after reaffirmation of approval of the samples, the respondent furnished the PBG in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49965147/ 14Union Of India vs Sureka International on 14 July, 2022
form of FDR dated 16.05.2015 Ex.CW-1/C7.
43. Before adverting further, I would like to reproduce some of the relevant clauses of the supply
order:
Para 3 Part 1 (Delivery Period): 75939 numbers to be supplied within 5 months and
balance 1 lakh to be supplied within next months or earlier after approval of advance
samples and bulk order clearance by this office. However, this clause will be
applicable only after fulfiling the condition of para 6 of part II of the supply order.
Please note that contract can be cancelled unilaterally by the buyer in case, items are
not received within the contracted delivery period.
Extension of contracted delivery period will be at the sole discretion of buyer with application of LD
clause, denial OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.31 of 47 clause
and other applicable clauses. Any request for DP extension by the seller should reach the buyer
minimum 40 days prior to the expiry of delivery period/extended delivery period......The delay in
number of days by seller in making such a request will be deducted from the total administrative
delay taken by buyer for grant of delivery period extension while calculating liquidated damages.
Para 6 Part I (Advance Sample Clause): Two numbers shall be submitted to the controller CQA
(TNC) Kanpur within 45 days from the date of issue of supply order for tests and approval. If seller

submit the advance sample report within 30 days of receipt of the sample. Para 8 Part III
(Liquidated Damages): In the event of the seller failure to submit the bonds, guarantees and
documents, supply the stores/goods etc as specified in the supply order, the buyer may at his

the maximum value of the liquidated damages being not higher than 10% of the value of delayed
stores.
Para 9 Part III (Termination of Supply Order): The buyer shall have the right to terminate the
supply order in part or in full (a) if the delivery of the material is delayed for causes not attributable

International Page No.32 of 47 after the scheduled date of delivery, b) the seller is declared bankrupt
or become insolvent c) the delivery of material is delayed due to causes of force majuere for more

DPM 15 and Clause 2 part IV.
Para 11 Part IV (Risk and Expense Clause): a) If the stores or any installment is not delivered within
the time as specified, the buyer shall after granting the seller 45 days to cure the breach will be at

b)..............., c) in case of material breach that was not remedied within 45 days, buyer shall have the
right of first refusal to the seller with liberty to purchase/procure from any source as he thinks fit of
the same stores........
44. In the impugned award, the arbitrator had considered the contentions of the respondent that
after the approval of the advance samples, the petitioner was required to re-fix the delivery period to
commence bulk manufacturing of the shirts OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha
International Page No.33 of 47 which was never done and the supply order was cancelled; that by
submitting the samples and depositing the requisite performance security, respondent fulfilled its
part of the contractual obligations but the petitioner instead re-fixing the delivery period as
provided under Clause 3 Part II of the Supply order, arbitrarily/illegally cancelled the supply order
and debarred it from participating in future tender enquiries without following the procedure
established by law, although in another contract relating to mattresses, dated 01.12.2014, placed on
the respondent, where there were also the allegations of furnishing forged bank guarantee and
thereafter, the respondent had furnished the FDR, the FDR was discharged and released to the
respondent vide letter dated 24.11.2015 i.e. after the date of forfeiture of the amount of PBG in the
present case; that the acceptance of PBG in the form of FDR and re-approval of samples would have
the effect of waiver in view of Section 8 and 55 of the Indian Contract Act and law laid down in the
case of Hind Construction Contractors v/s State of Maharashtra (supra).
The arbitrator had also considered the contentions of the petitioner who had referred Section 73 and
74 of the Indian Contract Act that the purpose of furnishing bank guarantee is that the bank on
behalf of the firm undertakes that in case, the goods are not supplied within the contractual period,
the bank shall cover up the losses upto the maximum limit as provided in the contract. He also
considered the case laws i.e. ONGC v/s OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International
Page No.34 of 47 Saw Pipes Ltd (supra), Ministry of Defence v/s Cenrex SPZO.O & Ors (supra),
Tamilnadu Telecommuncation v/s BSNL (supra) which have also been referred in the present
petition.
45. After considering the contentions, the arbitrator discussed Section 8, Section 55 of the Indian
Contract Act and the case of Hind Construction Contractors (supra) and analyzed the terms and
conditions as contained in the supply order which provided that liquidated damages can be claimed
only in the event of the seller's failure to submit the bonds/supply of stores etc as specified in the
order. He held that in the clause 8 Part III, it is mentioned that buyer may at its discretion withhold
any payment until the completion of the supply/deduct the said sum from the bill of the seller. He
also referred the case of ONGC v/s Saw Pipes (supra), Ministry of Defence, Government of India v/s
Sunrex S.V (supra), Section 51, 52 and 54 of the Indian Contract Act and held that there are two
types of contracts, one where the actual loss can be calculated and even if there is a clause of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49965147/ 16Union Of India vs Sureka International on 14 July, 2022
liquidated damages, only actual loss should be granted subject to the upper limit as specified in the
liquidated damages clause under Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act, second where loss is caused
but cannot be quantified in view of the nature of the contract, then the court should allow the
enforcement of liquidated damages under Section 74 of the Indian Contract Act. He referred the
case of Tamilnadu Telecommunications v/s Bharat Sanchar Nigam OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI
Vs. Surekha International Page No.35 of 47 Limited (supra) and Clause 3 Part II, Sub-Clause 6 of
Part I, Sub Clause 2 of Part III, Clause 8 of Part III, Clause 9 of Part III, Clause 1(a) of Part IV,
Clause 5 of Part IV and held that the supply order was concluded between the parties. He held that
the time was not the essence for supplying the goods since as per Clause 2 of Part III, supply order
shall come into effect on the date of its acknowledgment by the seller and shall remain valid until
the completion of the obligations of the parties under the supply order. It was the duty of the
petitioner to re-fix the date of the delivery within the stipulated period after the approval of advance
sample and bulk order clearance by the office. In this case, the samples were approved on 21.01.2015
and reapproved on 13.05.2015. The petitioner was required to re-fix the delivery period which was
not done. The bank guarantee by way of FDR was deposited by the respondent on 16.05.2015.
46. In the instant case, terms and conditions of the supply order nowhere specify that in case, the
respondent fails to furnish the PBG within the specified time, the petitioner shall be entitled to
forfeit the bank guarantee. I am of the view that the arbitrator has rightly applied the principles laid
down in the case of Hind Construction Company (supra) that the cancellation of contract and
forfeiting the security deposit by the petitioner would amount to committing of breach of contract.
He has distinguished the case of ONGC v/s Saw Pipes Ltd (supra) OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI
Vs. Surekha International Page No.36 of 47 observing that in the present case, despite fulfiling the
terms and conditions by the respondent, the petitioner cancelled the supply order without re-fixing
the date of delivery of goods. The penalty clause provides to claim liquidated damages only on the
event of delayed supplies, goods not supplied within the stipulated time or the goods are not
supplied in accordance with the specifications. Only in those events, PBG could be adjusted for the
satisfaction of losses incurred by the petitioner. The arbitrator also distinguished the case of
Ministry of Defence (supra) and held that in the present case, the respondent was not given any
opportunity to supply the goods. He held that the clauses in the supply order pertaining to the
imposition of penalty and extension of time were never intended by the parties to be the essence of
the contract.
47. In the instant case, as evident from the record, the samples were sent within time. The petitioner
in terms of Clause 3 and 6 of Part II of the Supply Order was bound to re-fix the delivery period
which it did not. As per Clause 8 Part III, the performance bond was meant to secure delay in
delivery and other breach of terms and conditions of the contract and the bond could be encashed
only in certain circumstances. 30 days time for furnishing PBG was never intended by the parties to
be the essence of contract as the supply order provided for imposition of penalty and extension of
time. PBG amount deposited in the form of FDR on 16.05.2015 was accepted by OMP Comm No.
100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.37 of 47 the petitioner thus, it waived the
condition of furnishing PBG within 30 days by virtue of Section 8 and 55 of the Indian Contract Act.
The arbitrator has rightly held that the act of cancellation of contract, forfeiture of amount of FDR
and debarring the respondent from taking part in further tender enquiries is malafide, arbitrary and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49965147/ 17Union Of India vs Sureka International on 14 July, 2022
unlawful only on the ground of alleged forged PBG allegedly furnished by the respondent though the
petitioner has failed to lead any evidence that the alleged offence of forgery was committed by the
respondent. The arbitrator also referred the case of Matresses i.e. File No.
A/59590/DGOS/2012/Mttress Kapok/OS PIII/Proc Sec/2298 related to the same party where the
amount was released in the similar case.
48. A perusal of the note at page 142 Ex.RW-1/K1 reveals that the issue raised by the Ministry in the
present reference is similar as earlier examined by it in File No. A/59590/DGOS/2012/Mttress
Kapok/OS PIII/Proc Sec/2298 in case of M/s sureka International, Kanpur vide Note 40/ante dated
27.05.2015 where the Ministry has advised to take similar action in the present reference against
M/s Sureka International, Kanpur as suggested by them in the file (date of breach is 10.12.2014).
49. I failed to understand why the policy of pick and choose was adopted by the petitioner as in one
case, the amount was released but in the present case, the amount was realized.
OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.38 of 47
50. That being the position, I do not find any infirmity/illegality in the award whereby the arbitrator
has held that the petitioner failed to prove that it was entitled to forfeit the sum deposited by the
respondent as PBG through FDR dated 16.05.2015 or that the respondent committed the breach of
the terms and conditions of the contract rather, it has proved that it has complied with all the terms
and conditions mentioned in the supply order and further, in none of the clauses of the supply
order, it is mentioned that due to non filing of PBG within the stipulated period, the petitioner is
competent to forfeit the amount of bank guarantee in the absence of any accounting between the
parties to the commercial contract. There is nothing in the wording of liquidated damages clause to
take the bond outside the usual commercial understanding as to how a performance bond operates.
It is also provided in the article that if there is failure to deliver any installment of the goods by the
date specified, only on those events, the amount of PBG can be encashed or adjusted towards the
losses suffered by the petitioner but in this case, date of delivery is not refixed so, the factum of
supplying the goods within the stipulated time never arose. He has rightly held that the respondent
is entitled for the refund of the sum deposited by it by way of FDR towards BG in compliance of the
terms and conditions provided in the supply order.
OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.39 of 47
51. Though ld. Counsel has contended that later, the same material was purchased by placing a
supply order to another firm namely, SR Enterprises under risk and purchase but the arbitral record
or the award do not find a word that the supply was taken under the risk and purchase. For the sake
of arguments, even if we presume that supply was taken under risk and purchase but ld. Counsel has
not disclosed whether any loss or damages was suffered by the petitioner on this count.
Therefore,no benefit can be given to the petitioner. Admittedly, the supplies were for the
troops/defence persons but it is well settled law that parties are bound by the terms and conditions
of the contract/supply order and the arbitrator was required to confine himself within the terms
while passing the award.

52. On issue no.6, the arbitrator had considered the contention of the respondent that the supply
order was cancelled invoking Clause 1 (a) Part IV of the supply order r/w Clause 6.12.1 (b) and
10.10.1 (d) of DPM 2009 and in the said clauses, it is nowhere provided that supply order shall be
cancelled in case, PBG is not submitted within the specified date; that the date of furnishing PBG
was extended till 20.03.2022 vide letter dated 09.03.2015; that non-filing of PBG is not the ground
to cancel the supply order as the amount could be deducted even from the first bill to be raised by
the respondent; that after the samples were re-approved vide letter dated 13.05.2015; FDR
equivalent to the amount of PBG was furnished on 16.05.2015 which was OMP Comm No.
100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.40 of 47 accepted by the petitioner and therefore,
the extended date did not remain sacrosanct; that because of the extension, time did not become the
essence of the contract; that the petitioner after cancelling the supply order, vide letter dated
10.08.2015 Ex.CW-1/C13 had written that the case is under investigation and action shall be taken
as per outcome and has rightly held referring findings on issue no.2, 3 and 4, that the act of the
petitioner to cancel the supply order/contract appears to be pre- meditated, arbitrary and unlawful
and not tenable in law.
53. As evident from the record, there is no report qua the investigation of alleged submission of
forged and fabricated PBG by the respondent. No post decisional hearing qua the alleged forged
bank guarantee was given to the respondent which is against the principles of natural justice and
fair play as enshrined under Article 14 of the Constitution. I, therefore, find no substance in the
contention of the petitioner which does not require interference.
54. Now coming on issue no.5 i.e. cost of the proceedings and interest on the security amount, it is
true that the arbitrator is competent to award interest and cost as provided under Section 31 (7) of
the Act and as per Section 15 and 16 of the MSME Act, 2006, all the dues of MSME units have to be
cleared within 15 days lest the other party shall be liable to pay compound interest with monthly
rests on the amount from the OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.41
of 47 appointed date at three times of the bank rate notified by the Reserve Bank and that the
petitioner vide its letter dated 30.07.2015, had requested for the encashment of FDR which was
released on 28.08.2015 and the petition for appointing an arbitrator was disposed of vide order
dated 20.03.2019.
55. It is also true that the respondent is SSI Unit and the petitioner had received the amount on
28.08.2015 but there was dispute whether the said amount was rightly realized or not. Though the
arbitrator has given compound interest on the amount of FDR at 12% per annum with quarterly
rests w.e.f. 28.08.2015 till the realization of the amount but it is also expected that the interest must
be the prevailing rate of interest and reasonable looking into the issue involved in the present matter
and that the government agency was involved which did not realize the interest on the amount more
than the normal banking rates. It is well settled that the court has power to vary the rate of interest.
In the case of Vedanta Limited v/s Shenzhen Shandong Nuclear Power, Civil Appeal No. 10394 of
2018, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the courts may reduce the interest rate awarded by an
Arbitral Tribunal where such interest rate does not reflect the prevailing economic conditions or
where it is nor found reasonable, or promotes the interests of justice. I am of the view that interest
of justice would be made if the respondent is given simple interest @ 9% per annum w.e.f.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49965147/ 19Union Of India vs Sureka International on 14 July, 2022
28.08.2015 i.e. the day when the amount against the FDR was realized till the OMP Comm No.
100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.42 of 47 realization of the amount.
56. As regards, cost of litigation which the arbitrator has awarded cost of Rs. 1,00,000/-, it appears
to be on higher side. I reduce the cost from Rs. 1,00,000/- to Rs. 35000/-. As regards fee, the
arbitrator has rightly calculated the fees which does not call for interference.
57. In the case of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd Vs. Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt Ltd, 2019
SCC OnLine Del 6562, it was held that the care must be taken that the Court does not rewrite or
create a new contract or an award in which case it is impermissible to dissect and segregate.
Reference was made to Section 23 of the Contract Act. It was held that these principles can be
applied to an award after referring to the decision of the Supreme Court in J.C. Budhiraja Vs.
Chairman, Orissa Mining corporation Ltd, (2008) 2 SCC 444, wherein it was held that the entire
award need not be set aside and part of the award which is valid and separable can be upheld.
58. In view of the law laid in the case of DMRC (supra), where reliance was placed on the case J.C.
Buddhiraja (supra), I am of the opinion that the entire award need not be set aside and part of the
award which is valid and separable can be upheld.
Now to sum up:
OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.43 of 47
59. On a careful study of the award and the record, I find that Ld. Arbitrator has considered all the
relevant facts & circumstances and the case laws referred by the parties, he has given a logical
interpretation to the terms of the contract and arrived at the findings, which do not smack from
arbitrariness.
60. The Supreme Court in catena of judgments while deliberating on the doctrine of perversity has
held that a decision is perverse or irrational, if no reasonable person could have arrived at it in the
given set of facts and circumstances and where a finding is based on "no evidence" or if an Arbitral
Tribunal takes into account something irrelevant and "ignores vital evidence", such decisions would
necessarily be perverse. (H. B. Gandhi, Excise & Taxation Officer-Cum Assessing Authority Vs. Gopi
Nath & Sons, 1992 Supp (2) SCC 312(at P-317), Kuldeep Singh VS. Commissioner of Police (1999) 2
SCC 10, Patel Engineering Ltd Vs. North Eastem Electric Power Corporation Ltd, SLP (C) No.
3584-85 of 2020 and Dyna Technologies Pvt Ltd Vs. Crompton Greaves Ltd (2019) SCC OnLine SC
1656). The award could be set aside, if it is contrary to Fundamental Policy of Indian Law or the
interest of India or justice or morality or it is patently illegal or is contrary to the substantive
provisions of law and against the terms of the contract as held in the case of (Venture Global Engg.
Vs. Satyam Computers Service Ltd, (2008) 4 SCC 190, MMTC Ltd. Vs. M/s Vedanta Ltd, CA No.
1862/2014, Associated Builders Vs. Delhi Development OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha
International Page No.44 of 47 Authority, 2014 (4) Arb. LR 307 (SC) and Lifelong Meditech (P) Ltd
Vs. United India Insurance Co. Ltd, 2018 (1) Arb. LR 34 (Delhi). The findings of fact as well as of law
of the Arbitrator are ordinarily not amenable to interference under Section 34 & 37 of the Act as
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49965147/ 20Union Of India vs Sureka International on 14 July, 2022
held in the case of NHAI Vs. BSC-RBM-Pati Joint Venture, 2018 (1) Arb. LR 570 (Del). It is only
where the finding is either contrary to the terms of the contract between the parties or ex-facie
perverse that interference by the Court is necessary.
61. It is also settled that an interpretation placed on a contract is a matter within the jurisdiction of
the Arbitral Tribunal and even if an error exists, this is an error of fact within jurisdiction which
cannot be re-appreciated by the Court under Section 34 of the Act. Legal position is no more res
integra that the Arbitrator having been made the final Arbiter of resolution of dispute between the
parties, the award is not open to challenge on the ground that Arbitrator has reached at a wrong
conclusion. If we were to start analyzing the contract between the parties and interpreting the terms
and conditions thereof and which will necessarily have to be in the light of the contemporaneous
conduct of the parties, it will be nothing else than sitting in appeal over the arbitral award which is
not permissible. It is thus clear that the section 34 does not envisage every award to be challenged
but limits the challenge to only those awards which are against the public policy of India or are OMP
Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.45 of 47 patently illegal. The
expansive scope of challenge to an award under the ground of patent illegality as held in "ONGC v.
Saw Pipes Ltd" (2003) 5 SCC 705 is further reduced by the Supreme court in the recent judgment
titled Ssyangyong Engineering v. NHAI, 2019 SCC OnLine SC 677.
62. Having examined the various contentions of the petitioner on the touchstone of the parameters
of interference as explicitly laid down by the Supreme Court in several judgments referred to above,
I am of the view that the impugned Award, except the interest for pre-award period and cost, does
not suffer from any infirmity or error apparent on the face of record. It is not for this Court to sit in
appraisal of the evidence led before the learned Arbitrator and this Court will not open itself to the
task of being a judge on the evidence placed before the Arbitrator which was subject matter of
dispute. In the present case, the Arbitrator has deliberated on the issues under reference which were
within his competence and as per the agreement entered into between the parties. The Arbitrator
has duly explained the reasons for arriving at his decisions. There is nothing to indicate that award
is in conflict with the basic notions of justice and the fair play and fundamental policy of Indian law
or in contravention of the terms of the agreement or it lacks reasoning as pleaded in the petition.
OMP Comm No. 100/2020 UOI Vs. Surekha International Page No.46 of 47
63. In view of the foregoing discussions, impugned award is maintained except the interest and the
cost part and is rewritten as under:
The petitioners are directed to make the payments of Rs. 29,55,775/- with simple
interest @ 9% per annum w.e.f. 28.08.2015 till its realization and also to make the
additional payment of cost of litigation for a sum of Rs. 35000/- + the arbitrator's
fees i.e. Rs. 1,88,887/-, total amounting to Rs. 2,23,887/- with simple interest @ 9%
per annum w.e.f. date of passing of award till its realization.
64. The petition is disposed of accordingly. Parties are left to bear their own costs.
