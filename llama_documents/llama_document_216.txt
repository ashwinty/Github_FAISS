Judgment on: March 26th, 2008.
Jayanta Kumar Biswas, J: - The two petitioners in this writ petition dated February 14th, 2008
taken out under art.226 of the Constitution of India are seeking a writ of certiorari quashing (a) the
Consumer Case No.23 of 2006 that was allowed on contest by the Consumer Disputes Redressal
Forum, Abasbari, Tamluk, Purba Medinipur by its final order dated March 28th, 2007, and (b) the
Execution Case No.14 of 2007 initiated before the forum for execution of its order dated March
28th, 2007.
The consumer case was registered on the basis of a complaint under s.12 of the Consumer Protection
Act, 1986 lodged by the sixth respondent, Sri Nakul Chandra Sahu, with the forum in 2006. The first
and second among the five opposite parties in the complaint were Sri Bishnupada Barman and Sri
Bhakti Binod Samanta, the chairman and the secretary respectively of one Garh Moyna Samabay
Krishi Unnayan Samity Ltd., a co-operative society registered within the meaning of the provisions
of the West Bengal Co-operative Societies Act, 1983. It was alleged that the first and second opposite
parties in the complaint failed and neglected to pay the monies which had become payable once the
fixed deposits of the complainant matured. The first and second opposite parties in the complaint

contested the case by giving their version of the case in writing. They took the plea that in view of the
provisions in ss.95 and134 of the West Bengal Co- operative Societies Act, 1983 the forum had no
jurisdiction to entertain the complaint. By the order dated March 28th, 2007 the forum rejected the
plea and allowed the complaint. The first and second opposite parties therein were directed to pay
the amount with interest. Since the amount was not paid, the complainant lodged an execution
application on June 20th, 2007. Consequently the execution case was registered.
On receipt of notice of the complaint the opposite parties therein did not invite the forum to decide
the question of maintainability of the complaint as a preliminary issue. They rather decided to get
decision on the question at the time of final disposal of the case registered by the forum. They did
not lodge any appeal to the state commission, though in view of the provisions of s.15 of the
Consumer Protection Act, 1986 they were entitled to do that. Section 15 provides as follows:
"15. Appeal. - Any person aggrieved by an order made by the District Forum may prefer an appeal
against such order to the State Commission within a period of thirty days from the date of the order,
in such form and manner as may be prescribed:
Provided that the State Commission may entertain an appeal after the expiry of the said period of
thirty days if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing it within that period:
Provided further that no appeal by a person, who is required to pay any amount in terms of an order
of the District Forum, shall be entertained by the State Commission unless the appellant has
deposited in the prescribed manner fifty per cent of that amount or twenty-five thousand rupees,
whichever is less."
The petitioners participated in the execution case without raising the question of jurisdiction of the
forum to initiate it. Against the order made in the execution case their remedy, if any, was once
again before the state commission. They chose not to invoke the power of the state commission
conferred on it by s.17 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. Section 17(1) provides as follows:
"17. Jurisdiction of the State Commission. - (1) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the State
Commission shall have jurisdiction -
(a) to entertain -
(i) complaints where the value of the goods or services and compensation, if any,
claimed exceeds rupees twenty lakhs but does not exceed rupees one crore; and
(ii) appeals against the order of any District Forum within the State; and
(b) to call for the records and pass appropriate orders in any consumer dispute which
is pending before or has been decided by any District Forum within the State, where
it appears to the State Commission that such District Forum has exercised a
jurisdiction not vested in it bylaw, or has failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/148730858/ 2Garh-Moyna Samabay Krishi ... vs The State Of West Bengal & Ors on 26 March, 2008
has acted in exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity."
They did not approach the state commission, and instead approached the writ court. They are
contending that since the forum was lacking in the initial jurisdiction to entertain the complaint,
they are entitled to approach the writ court. The questions are whether the writ petition is
maintainable, and if maintainable, whether it should be entertained.
Mr De, counsel for the petitioners, relies on Anjan Choudhury v. Anandaneer Co-operative
Registered Housing Society & Ors., AIR 1990 Cal 380(SB); Haryana Seeds Development
Corporation Ltd. v. Sadhu & Anr.,(2005)3 SCC 198; SDO, Electricity & Anr. v. B.S. Lobana, (2005)6
SCC 280; and Kishore Lal v. Chairman, Employees' State Insurance Corporation, (2007)4 SCC 579.
Mr Haque, counsel for the state, has relied on Vikas Motors Ltd. v. Dr.P.K.Jain, (1999)6 SCC 548;
and Duncans Industries Ltd. v. Hindola Dutta Roy, 2006(2) CLJ (Cal) 165. Mr Mustafa is appearing
in a similar case which has been heard with this case, and he has relied on Surendra M. Mittal &
Anr. v. National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission & Anr., AIR 2008 Delhi 35(DB). It is to
be examined whether any of these authorities say anything regarding maintainability of a writ
petition under art.226 of the Constitution of India against an order made by a Consumer Disputes
Redressal Forum established under s.9 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. For convenience' sake
I propose to deal with the cited decisions in chronological order.
In the special bench decision in Anjan Choudhury v. Anandaneer Co- operative Registered Housing
Society & Ors., AIR 1990 Cal 380(SB) nothing connected with the Consumer Protection Act, 1986
was decided. There the question was whether in view of the provisions in s.134 of the West Bengal
Co- operative Societies Act, 1983, with a dispute covered by s.95 of that Act, one could approach the
civil court, and it was held in the negative. In sub-s.2 of s.134 of the West Bengal Co-operative
Societies Act, 1983 it has been provided that save as provided in the Act, no civil court or revenue
court shall have jurisdiction in regard to, inter alia, any dispute under s.95 to be referred to the
registrar.
In Vikas Motors Ltd. v. Dr. P.K.Jain, (1999)6 SCC 548 an order of the national commission was
questioned before the apex court by filing special leave petition and at that stage the appellant
therein raised the plea that the district forum had no territorial jurisdiction to entertain the
complaint. The plea was turned down by their Lordships on the ground that after participating in
the proceedings and being satisfied with the verdict regarding jurisdiction, the appellant in that case
was not entitled to raise the plea of jurisdiction before the apex court.
In Haryana Seeds Development Corporation Ltd. v. Sadhu & Anr.,(2005)3 SCC 198 also the matter
reached the apex court though special leave petition filed against an order of the national
commission. In that case one of the opposite parties in the complaint contended before the district
forum that on the facts the complaint was not maintainable against it, since, in so far as it was
concerned, the complainant was not a consumer. The party taking this point was incidentally a
co-operative society. Nothing was decided in that case regarding any right of a party to approach the
writ court against an order made by a district forum constituted under the Consumer Protection Act,
1986.

In SDO, Electricity & Anr. v. B.S. Lobana, (2005)6 SCC 280 as a matter of fact no law was declared
by their Lordships of the apex court. Their Lordships only said that instead of moving the district
forum Lobana should have moved an application under s.26(6) of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910.
In Duncans Industries Ltd. v. Hindola Dutta Roy, 2006(2) CLJ (Cal) 165 a single bench of this court
was deciding a civil revision application under art.227 of the Constitution of India, and in that
context it was held that remedy of the petitioner therein was under the provisions of the Consumer
Protection Act, 1986, and not under art.227. Incidentally his Lordship also referred to art.226 of the
Constitution of India, but there was no scope to examine such a question as has arisen in the present
case.
In Kishore Lal v. Chairman, Employees' State Insurance Corporation, (2007)4 SCC 579 one of the
questions their Lordships of the apex court were examining was whether s.74 read with s.75 of the
Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948 did oust the jurisdiction of the district forum over the subject
matter involved in that case. After considering the nature of the dispute, their Lordships held that in
that case the provisions of the Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948 did not oust the jurisdiction of
the forum established under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. There also the matter reached the
apex court from an order of the national commission made in the revision application filed by
Kishore Lal against the order of the state commission that had upheld the order of the district
forum.
In Surendra M. Mittal & Anr. v. National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission & Anr., AIR
2008 Delhi 35(DB) such a question as has arisen in the present case did not arise for consideration.
There questioning an order of the national commission Surendra filed a writ petition, which was
dismissed by a single bench and against which an appeal was lodged before the division bench of the
Delhi High Court. While dismissing the appeal on merits, their Lordships said that even if it was
conceded and accepted that an order passed by the national commission in a first appeal could be
made the subject matter of challenge in a writ court, Surendra's case was not one requiring exercise
of the writ powers. It is therefore evident that the authorities given to me do not provide the answer
to the question that has fallen for consideration in this case.
In my opinion, there is no reason to say that a writ petition under art.226 of the Constitution of
India is not at all maintainable against an order of a Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum
established under s.9 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. As is known, under art.226 a writ of
certiorari can be issued against any inferior court or quasi-judicial tribunal, authority, agency, or
body. The forum established under s.9 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is the lowest agency or
body in the hierarchical quasi-judicial machinery set up by the Act for speedy and simple redressal
of consumer disputes; it is a quasi- judicial body. I therefore hold that against an order of a district
forum a writ petition under art.226 can be filed before the high court. But then, I am of the firm
view that it is only in a very exceptional case that a writ petition against an order of a district forum
constituted under s.9 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 should be entertained by the high court.
It should be entertained only when the person approaching the writ court, for no fault of his own, is
deprived of the remedies of appeal and revision provided by the provisions of ss.15 and 17 of the
Consumer Protection Act, 1986.

The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is a special statute providing a three- level quasi-judicial
machinery for speedy and simple settlement of consumer disputes, the three agencies are competent
to entertain. Its s.3 provides that the provisions in it shall be in addition to and not in derogation of
the provisions of any other law for the time being in force. A party aggrieved by an order of a district
forum is entitled to lodge an appeal under s.15 with the state commission concerned. If the party
alleges lack of jurisdiction of the district forum, he can invoke the revisional jurisdiction of the state
commission especially conferred on it by the provisions of s.17. If it is held that generally against an
order of a district forum an aggrieved person is entitled to approach the writ court, then, in my view,
such a proposition is to bound to defeat the special purposes for which the Consumer Protection Act,
1986 has been enacted. Having regard to the nature and character of the remedies available under
ss.15 and 17 thereof, I do not think it will be appropriate to see them as mere alternative remedies.
Special revisional power has been conferred on the state commission to correct an error of
jurisdiction of the district forum without loss of any time. Unless it is shown that this remedy is
unavailable to one, in my opinion, one should not be permitted to approach the writ court under
art.226, even when it is alleged that the district forum has made the complained of order without
jurisdiction. In the absence of compelling circumstances the writ powers should not be exercised to
derail the proceedings initiated before the agencies. I therefore hold that it is only in an exceptional
case that one should be permitted to approach the writ court against an order of a district forum
established under s.9 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
In view of what I have said hereinbefore, I hold that this writ petition is maintainable. But then, the
question is whether there are any exceptional reasons for entertaining it. The only ground on which
the writ jurisdiction has been invoked is that the district forum had no jurisdiction to entertain the
complaint. This contention has been made by making reference to the provisions of ss.95 and 134 of
the West Bengal Co-operative Societies Act, 1983. The petitioners accepted the decision of the
district forum on the question of its jurisdiction to entertain the complaint. They did not lodge any
appeal and thus allowed the order of the district forum to attain finality in terms of the provisions in
s.24 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The order was made as back as March 28th, 2007. Not
only they did not lodge any appeal, they did not lodge any revision against the order of the district
forum made in the execution case as well. Although they were entitled to call upon the district forum
to decide the question of jurisdiction as a preliminary issue, they had never thought it appropriate to
do that. They were quite conscious of the prohibition put by s.134(2) only on the civil and revenue
courts. The forum, a quasi-judicial body, is just none of them. On these facts, I do not see any reason
to exercise my discretion in favour of entertaining the writ petition.
For these reasons, I dismiss the writ petition. There shall be no order for costs.
Urgent certified xerox copy of this order, if applied for, shall be supplied to the parties within three
days from the date of receipt of the file by the section concerned.
