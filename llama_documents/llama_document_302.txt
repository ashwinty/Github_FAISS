The said objection in question was resisted by contending that Ram Vilas was the real brother of
petitioner and was a co-sharer alongwith them as such bar contained under Section 49 of the Act
would not apply.
Faced with this situation, the Learned Single Judge, as important point of law has been raised that
would affect the public at large, made request for matter being placed before the Larger Bench and
Hon'ble the Chief Justice was requested for formation of Bench. The reference in question contains
following questions:-
"(i) Whether use of words "could or ought to have been taken" in latter part of Section
49 of the Act, compulsorily forces the co-sharers, who are living jointly, peacefully
and have no grievance against their father/brother/co-sharer, whose name is
recorded in representative capacity, or they were willing to live jointly, due to
situation of their family, i.e. (father and minor son), (mother and minor son),
(brother and minor brother) and (some co-sharer was student and had gone abroad
for study and fully depends upon other co-sharers) etc., to file an objection under
Section 9 of the Act for separation of his share?
(ii) Whether by operation of law, the parties can be thrown into litigation against
their will/need and by not raising claim to land or partition and separation of the
chak their right to property can be taken away in spite of protection available under
Article 19 (1) (f) and now Article 300-A of the Constitution?
(iii) Whether, in spite of well settled legal principle in respect of joint property, right
of a co-sharer will come to an end under Section 49 of the Act, on the notification
under Section 52, due to not claiming partition of his share and separate chak in his
name, although, there had been no ouster from joint property?"
This Bench thereafter has been constituted by the order of Hon'ble the Chief Justice to answer the
issues raised.
Heard Shri Anupam Kulshrestha, Advocate; Shri D.S.P. Singh, Advocate; Shri Abhijeet Mukherji,
Advocate; Shri C.B. Yadav, Senior Advocate assisted by Shri Shashank Sekhar Singh, Advocate
representing State; Shri A.P. Tiwari, Advocate; Shri Vinai Khare, Advocate; and all of them with the
best of preparation came forward to assist the Court so that correct preposition of law is settled in
reference of Section 49-Bar to Civil Courts Jurisdiction."

Explanation- For the purposes of sub-section (2) 'society' means a society registered under the
Societies Registration Act, 1860.
The provisions quoted above would go to show that a full-fledged mechanism has been set in place
for the abolition of zamindari system for tiller of the soil in the State of Uttar Pradesh and for the
acquisition of their rights, title and interest and to reform the law relating to land consequent upon
such acquisition, the way and manner in which the land in question was to be settled has clearly
been mentioned therein be it bhumidhar, be it sirdar, be it adivashi or assami of any land and to
continue to enjoy the land, and the way and manner in which bhumidhari rights would accrue
alongwith right to sell and with no right to sell has also been extensively dealt with. Apart from this
U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act. 1950 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) contains
provisions with heading 'transfers' from Sections 152 to 168. Section 152 of the Act provides that
interest of a bhumidhar with transferable rights shall, subject to the conditions hereinafter
contained, be transferable. Section 153 provides that interest of an asami shall not be transferable.
Section 154 contains restriction that no bhumidhar shall have the right to transfer by sale or gift, any
land other than tea gardens to any person where the transferee shall, as a result of such sale or gift,
became entitled to land which together with land, if any. held by his family will in the aggregate,
exceed 5.0586 hectares in Uttar Pradesh. Section 155 provides that no bhumidhar shall have the
right to mortgage any land belonging to him as such where possession of the mortgaged land is
transferred or is agreed to be transferred in future to the mortgagee as security for the money
advanced or to be advanced. The section contains prohibition that no bhumidhar shall have the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38040744/ 15Ram Briksha And Another vs Dy. Director Of Consolidation And 3 ... on 16 May, 2017
right to mortgage any land with possession. Section 156 contains provision with letting of land.
Section 157 pertains to lease by disabled person. Sections 157A and 157AA contain provisions
regarding restrictions on transfer of land by members of Scheduled Castes. With regard to
registration of lease. Section 158 contains following provisions :
"158. Registration of a lease.--Notwithstanding anything contained in the Transfer of
Property Act, 1882 (Act IV of 1882) or the Indian Registration Act, 1908 (Act XVI of
1908), a lease for a term exceeding one year or from year to year may be made either
by a registered instrument or in the prescribed manner."
The opening word of Section 164 provides, "Any transfer of any holding or part thereof made by a
bhumidhar by which possession is transferred to the transferee for the purpose
..,..........................................." The section uses word transfer of any holding. The word transfer has
not been defined in U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act or the Rules framed
thereunder. The word holding has also not been defined under the U.P. Zamindari Abolition and
Land Reforms Act but it adopts the definition of holding as given in U.P. Tenancy Act, 1939. by
virtue of Section 3 (26) of U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act. The word holding has
been defined in Section 3 (7) of U.P. Tenancy Act, 1939, as follows :
"holding" means a parcel or parcels of land held under one lease, engagement or
grant, or in the absence of such lease, engagement or grant under one tenure and in
the case of a 'thekadar includes the theka area ;"
Section 129 of U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act defines tenure which includes
bhumidhar with transferable rights and bhumidhar with non-transferable rights. The concept of
transferable rights is attached with tenures. As noted above, Sections 152 to 167 relate to transfers
and are provisions given under heading of word transfers. The words mortgage, sale, gift have been
referred to as Incidence of transfers in provisions of Sections 152 to 167. When the word transfer has
not been defined under the U.P.Z.A. and L.R. Act what is the importance and meaning of word
transfer has to be looked into. Section 156 (2) 'provides that word lease and its cognate expression
have the meaning assigned to them in the Transfer of Property Act. 1882. Section 156 (2) is quoted
below :
"156 (2) In this Chapter, the word "Lease" and its cognate expression have the
meaning assigned to them in the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (IV of 1882)."
U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, which is a special Act, in itself does not give any
special definition or meaning of word transfer, the word transfer as defined in Transfer of Property
Act has to be looked into. Section 5 of Transfer of Property Act. 1882. defines transfer of property.
Section 5 of Transfer of Property Act is quoted below :
"5. 'Transfer of properly' defined.--In the following sections 'transfer of properly'
means an acl by which a living person conveys property, in present or in future, to
one or more other living persons, or to himself and one or more other living persons ;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38040744/ 16Ram Briksha And Another vs Dy. Director Of Consolidation And 3 ... on 16 May, 2017
and "to transfer property" is to perform such act.
In this section "living person" includes a company or association or body of
individuals, whether incorporated or not. but nothing herein contained shall affect
any law for the time being in force relating to transfer of property to or by companies,
associations or bodies of individuals."
Transfer of holding as contemplated in U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act is transfer
of property. A parcel of land or part of land or land included in a tenure is undoubtedly a property.
Section 5 of Transfer of Property Act uses word 'convey'. The word convey has been defined in P.
Ramanatha Aiyar's Law Lexicon 2nd edition as :
"Convey" defined by Act 27 of 1866, Section 2.
CONVEY, to carry ; to bear ; to conduct ; to import ; to take to or from ; to transport ;
to carry or transport the thing to another person or place ; to assure ; to grant ; to
pass ; to pass a thing from one person to another as by deed, assignment or otherwise
; to transfer ; to transfer title of property.
1. To transport ; to take from one place to another (Section 282. I.P.C.) : 2. transfer
property by means of instrument and other formalities ; 3. to transport ; to
communicate."
Section 9 of Transfer of Property Act relates to oral transfer which provides that a transfer of
property may be made without writing in every case in which a writing is not expressly required by
law. Section 54 of Transfer of Properly Act defines tangible immovable property of the value of Rs.
100 and upwards that can be made only by registered instruments. Section 54 is quoted as below :
"54. "Sale" defined.--"Sale" is a transfer of ownership in exchange for a price paid or
promised or part-paid and part-promised.
Sale how made.--Such transfer, in the case of tangible immovable property of the
value of one hundred rupees and upwards, or in the case of a reversion or other
intangible thing, can be made only by a registered Instrument.
In the case of tangible immovable property of a value less than one hundred rupees,
such transfer may be made either by a registered instrument or by delivery of the
property.
Delivery of tangible immovable property takes place when the seller places the buyer,
or such person as he directs, in possession of the property.
Contract for sale.--A contract for the sale of immovable property is a contract that a
sale of such property shall take place on terms settled between the parties.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38040744/ 17Ram Briksha And Another vs Dy. Director Of Consolidation And 3 ... on 16 May, 2017
It does not, of itself, create any Interest in or charge on such property."
Section 58 of Transfer of Property Act defines mortgage, Section 58(a) defines as under :
"58. "Mortgage", "mortgagor", "mortgagee", "mortgage-money' and "mortgage-deed"
defined.--(a) A mortgage is the transfer of an interest in specific immovable property
for the purpose of securing the payment of money advanced or to be advanced by way
of loan, an existing or future debt, or the performance of an engagement which may
give rise to a pecuniary liability.
The transferor is called a mortgagor, the transferee a mortgagee ; the principal money
and interest of which payment is secured for the time being are called the
mortgage-money, and the instrument (if any) by which the transfer is effected is
called a mortgage-deed."
Section 59 provides that where principal money secured is one hundred rupees or upwards, a
mortgage other than a mortgage by deposit of title deeds can be effected only by a registered
instrument signed by the mortgagor. Section 59 is quoted as below :
"59. Mortgage when to be by assurance.--Where the principal money secured is one
hundred rupees or upwards, a mortgage other than a mortgage by deposit of title
deeds can be effected only by a registered instrument signed by the mortgagor and
attested by at least two witnesses.
Where the principal money secured is less than one hundred rupees, a mortgage may
be effected either by a registered instrument signed and attested as aforesaid or
(except in the case of a simple mortgage) by delivery of the property."
This Court in several decisions had applied the provisions of Transfer of Property Act with regard to
transfers made by bhumidhar under provisions of U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act.
In Jagat Narain v. Laljee and others, 1964 RD 331, question arose as to whether provisions of
Section 43 of Transfer of Property Act will be applicable to a transfer made by sirdar when
subsequently he acquired bhumidhari rights. This Court applied the provisions of Section 43 of
Transfer of Property Act in the aforesaid case. It was held in the aforesaid case that :
"It must, therefore, be held that if a person professed to transfer the interest of a
bhumidhar in a land in which he had only the non-transferable interest of a sirdar
but he subsequently acquires in the land the interest of a bhumidhar, the benefit of
the subsequent acquisition would go to the transferee, under Section 43 of the
Transfer of Property Act, and the subsequently acquired interest of a bhumidhar will
be deemed as having passed to the transferee under the transfer in his favour. Section
6 of the Transfer of Property Act cannot stand in the way of the applicability of
Section 43 of the Transfer of Property Act because these two provisions have different
spheres of operation and the question of conflict between them does not arise."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38040744/ 18Ram Briksha And Another vs Dy. Director Of Consolidation And 3 ... on 16 May, 2017
Thus, it is clear that the provisions of Transfer of Property Act are fully applicable while effecting a
transfer of holding by bhumidhar. In the Act, wherever it is mentioned that particular meaning
given in Transfer of Property Act or Indian Registration Act be not given to a transaction, specific
provision has been made in U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act. Reference has been
made to Section 158 of U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act which provides that lease
for a term exceeding one year or from year to year may be made either by a registered instrument or
in the prescribed manner. Section 158 of U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act has
overriding effects to the provisions of Transfer of Property Act and Indian Registration Act whereas
Section 107 of Transfer of Property Act provides that a lease of immovable property from year to
year, or for any term exceeding one year can be made only by the registered instrument. Section 158
clearly contemplates that applicability of Transfer of Property Act as well as Indian Registration Act
is not ruled out in application to U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act and the provisions
are overridden in specific case. Apart from Section 59 of Transfer of Property Act, Section 17 of
Indian Registration Act also provides that registration of instruments to value of more than 100
rupees or more of immovable property is required when such an instrument purports or operates to
create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish, whether in present or in future, any right, title or interest,
whether vested or contingent. Section 17(1) of Indian Registration Act is quoted below :
17. Documents of which registration is compulsory.--(1) The following documents
shall be registered if the property to which they relate is situate in a district in which,
and if they have been executed on or after the date on which, Act No. XVI of 1964, or
the Indian Registration Act. 1866. or the Indian Registration Act, 1871, or the Indian
Registration Act, 1877, or this Act came or comes into force, namely :
(a) instruments of gift of immovable properly ;
(b) other non-testamentary instruments which purport or operate, to create, declare,
assign, limit or extinguish, whether in present or in future, any right, title or interest,
whether vested or contingent, of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, to or
in immovable property ;
(c) non-testamentary instruments which acknowledge the receipt or payment of any
consideration on account of the creation, declaration, assignment, limitation or
extinction of any such right, title or interest ; and
(d) lease of immovable property from year to year, or for any term exceeding one
year, or reserving a yearly rent ;
(e) non-testamentary instruments transferring or assigning any decree or order of a
Court or any award when such decree or order or award purports or operates to
create, declare assign, limit or extinguish, whether in present or in further, any right,
title or interest, whether vested or contingent, of the value of one hundred rupees and
upwards, to or in immovable property :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38040744/ 19Ram Briksha And Another vs Dy. Director Of Consolidation And 3 ... on 16 May, 2017
Provided that the State Government may, by order published in the Official Gazette,
except from the operation of this sub-section any lease executed in any district, or
part of a district, the terms granted by which do not exceed five years and the annual
rents reserved by which do not exceed fifty rupees."
From the above discussions, it is clear that any transfer of any holding regarding an
amount of Rs. 100 or more can be only executed by registered documents. "Any
transfer of any holding" referred to under Section 164 of U.P. Zamindari Abolition
and Land Reforms Act refers to transfer of any interest in any holding if the value is
more than 100 rupees of immovable property, the transfer has to be effected in
accordance with law. No right or interest can pass in immovable property in a
manner contrary to provisions of Transfer of Property Act and Indian Registration
Act. The Division Bench of this Court in Mohd. Fasih v. Munir Khan, 1987 ALJ 617,
considered the scope and ambit of Section 164 of U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land
Reforms Act. The Division Bench held in paragraph 16 :
"16. Counsel for the respondents in this connection urged that in view of Section 164,
U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, the agreement in question would be
deemed to be a transfer inasmuch as it was admitted therein that possession over the
property in suit had been delivered to the respondents in pursuance of the said
agreement. According to him since possession over the property had been transferred
to the respondents in pursuance of the said agreement the agreement was for all
purposes a sale of the property. This submission also is on the face of it untenable.
Section 164, U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act. deals with transfer
with possession by a bhumidhar. It contemplates transfer of any holding or any part
thereof made by a bhumidhar by which possession is transferred to the transferee for
the purpose of securing any payment of money referred to in the said section. On the
face of it for the application of Section 164 transfer of possession alone is not
sufficient. What is required by the section is transfer of possession made in
pursuance of transfer of any holding or part thereof. Since an agreement of sale does
not have the effect of transferring any holding or part thereof even if possession was
transferred of the holding in pursuance of the said agreement it cannot be said that
the agreement amounted to a sale under Section 164. Moreover, Section 164
contemplates transfer by a bhumidhar."
The entire scheme detailed out above shows the property interest of a person in property alongwith
right conferred to transfer property.
The U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953 has been introduced with the objective to allot a
compact area to the tenure holders in place of their scattered plots with the view of land reforms so
that tenure holders may have their private source of irrigation at one place and also to save crops
etc. from boundary disputes.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38040744/ 20Ram Briksha And Another vs Dy. Director Of Consolidation And 3 ... on 16 May, 2017
Under U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act 1953, Consolidation means re-arrangement of holding in
a unit amongst several tenure-holders in such a way as to make their respective holding more
compact. Holding means a parcel or parcels of land held by one tenure by a tenure holder singly or
jointly with other tenure holders. Land means land held or occupied for purposes connected with
agriculture, horticulture and animal husbandry (including pisciculture and poultry farming) and
includes-(i) the site being part of holding, of a house or other similar structure; and (ii) trees, wells
and other improvements existing on the plots forming the holding. Tenure holder means a
bhumidhar with transferable rights or bhumidhar with non-transferable rights and includes (a) an
assami (b) a Government lessee or Government Grantee or (c) a co-operative farming society
satisfying such conditions as may be prescribed.
In the Act, as originally enacted, Section 12 made provision for filing of objections against the
statement of plots and tenure-holders prepared by the consolidation authorities and in sub-section
(4) of Section 12 it was prescribed that where the objection filed under subsection (1) involves a
question of title and such question has not already been determined by a competent court, the
Consolidation Officer shall refer the question for determination to the Arbitrator. Sub-section (5) of
Section 12 provided that all suits or proceedings in the Court of first instance or appeal in which a
question of title in relation to some land has been raised shall be stayed. Under subsection (6) Of
Section 12 finality was given to the decision of the Arbitrator under sub-section (4). Similarly
Section 20 made provision for filing of objections against statement of proposals prepared by the
consolidation authorities under Section 19 of the Act. Section 22 prescribed that where any objection
filed under Section 20 involves a question of title in or over land and such question has not already
been finally determined by a competent court, the Consolidation Officer shall refer it to the
Arbitrator for determination and all suits or proceedings of the first instance or appeal in which a
question of title in relation to the same had been raised shall be stayed and the decision of the
Arbitrator shall be final. There was a similar provision for reference to Arbitrator in Section 36.
These provisions indicate that initially the Act envisaged that questions of title, if not finally
determined by a competent court, shall, instead of being decided by the Courts, be decided by an
Arbitrator and the decision of the Arbitrator would be final. The inevitable conclusion was that the
determination of questions of title was withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the Courts.
Extensive amendments were made in the Act by the U .P. Consolidation of Holdings (Amendment)
Act, 1958 (U.P. Act No. 38 of 1958) whereby a number of sections including section 36, were deleted
and various provisions, including , sections 5, 7 to 12 and 22, were substituted. As a result of these
amendments the provisions with regard to Arbitration contained in Sections 12, 22 and 36 of the
original Act were removed. In sub-clause (i) of Clause (b) of Section 5, as substituted, it was
provided that all proceedings for correction of the records and all suits for declaration of rights and
interests over land, or for possession of land or for partition, pending before any authority or court,
whether of first instance, appeal, or reference, or revision, shall stand stayed, but without prejudice
to the rights of the persons affected to agitate the right or interest in dispute in the said proceeding
or suits before the consolidation authorities under and in accordance with the provisions of the Act
and the Rules made thereunder. In sub-clause (ii) of Clause (b) it was further provided that the
findings of consolidation authorities in proceedings under the Act in respect of such right or interest
in the land, shall be acceptable to the authority or court before whom the proceeding or suit was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38040744/ 21Ram Briksha And Another vs Dy. Director Of Consolidation And 3 ... on 16 May, 2017
pending which may, on communication thereof by the parties concerned, proceed with the
proceeding or suit, as the case may be.
Section 7 of the Act relates to revision of village map with a view to facilitate the revision of records
of each village or part thereof, and in the said direction the District Deputy Director of Consolidation
is obligated to get revised the village maps of such unit before the provisional Consolidation Scheme
for a unit is prepared. Sub-Section (1) of Section 8 deals with revision of field book and the correct
annual register; determination of valuations and shares in joint holding. The Deputy Director of
Consolidation, upon the revision of the map as envisaged under Section 7, subject to the provisions
contained and subject to procedure prescribed is obligated to get:
(i) revised, the field-book of the unit after field to field partal, and the current annual
register after its test and verification,
(ii) determined in consultation with Consolidation Committee, the valuation of (a)
each plot after taking into consideration its productivity, location and availability of
irrigation facility, if any; and (b) all trees, wells and other improvements existing in
the plots for the purposes of computing compensation therefor;
(iii) ascertained the share of each owner; if there be more owners than one, out of
valuation determined under sub-clause (b) of clause (ii) and
(iv) determined the shares of individual tenure holders in joint holding for the
purpose of effecting partition to ensure proper consolidation.
Sub-Section (2) of Section 8 obligates District Deputy Director of Consolidation to get prepared a
Khasra Chakbandi, in the form prescribed in respect of all the plots falling the unit as also statement
showing the mistakes, undisputed cases of succession and disputes discovered during the test and
verification of the annual register and in the course of field to field partal.
In Section 9 as substituted provision was made for issuing notice of the statement prepared under
Section 8 of the Act to tenure- holders concerned and to persons interested calling upon them to file
before him objections, if any, disputing the correctness or nature of the entries in the extracts and
pointing out of any omission therefrom. In Section 10 of the Act provision was made for
adjudication by the Consolidation Officer of the said objections in disputed cases. In Section 11
provision was made for appeal against the orders passed by the Assistant Consolidation Officer and
the Consolidation Officer under Sections 9 and 10. Section 12, as substituted, prescribed that all
matters relating to changes and transfers affecting any of the rights or interests recorded in the
revised records published under Section 1 1B for which a cause of action was non-existent when
proceedings under Sections 7 to 10 were started or were in progress may be raised before the
Assistant Consolidation Officer as and when they arise but not later than the date of notification
under Section 52 or under sub-section (1) of Section 6 and that the provisions of Sections 7 to II
shall mutatis mutandis, apply to the hearing and decision of any matter praised under Section (1) as
if it were a matter raised under the aforesaid Sections. The scheme of the above-mentioned
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38040744/ 22Ram Briksha And Another vs Dy. Director Of Consolidation And 3 ... on 16 May, 2017
amendments introduced in the Act by the Amendment Act of 1958 was to empower the
consolidation authorities to adjudicate on matters involving declaration of right and interests over
land or for possession of land or for partition and suits or proceedings in that regard pending before
any Court were to be stayed till such determination and after such determination. the Court was to
proceed with the said proceedings in the light of the findings of the consolidation authorities. In
other words the question as to title which were earlier required to be determined by arbitration were
to be adjudicated upon by the consolidation authorities under the Act. From the Statement of
Objects and Reasons for the Amendment Act of 1958 it appears that it become necessary to do away
with the provisions for arbitration because it used to cause great delay and in order to inspire
greater confidence in the people in the adjudication of rights of tenure- holders by consolidation
authorities provision was made for a Second Appeal against orders passed by the Consolidation
officer.
Further amendment was made in Section 5 of the Act by U.P. Act No. 21 of 1966 whereby clause (b)
of sub-section (1) of Section 5, as renumbered, was omitted and sub-section (2) was added in
Section 5. By clause (a) of the said sub- section (2) it has been provided that upon the publication of
the notification under sub-section (2) of Section 4 every proceeding for the correction of the records
and all suits and other proceedings in respect of declaration of rights and interests in any land lying
in the area, or for declaration or adjudication of any other right in regard to which proceedings can
or ought to be taken under the Act, pending before any Court or authority whether of the first
instance or of appeal, reference or revision, shall, on an order being passed in that behalf by the
Court or authority before whom such suit or proceeding is pending, stand abated. In clause (b) of
sub-section (2) of Section 5 it is further provided that such abatement shall be without prejudice to
the rights of the persons affected to agitate the right or interest in dispute in the said suit or
proceedings before the appropriate consolidation authorities under and in accordance with the
provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder. As a result of the said amendment which has
been introduced in Section 5 the right of the Courts to adjudicate in respect of declaration of rights
or interest in any land lying in the area for which the notification has been issued under Section 4(2)
or for declaration or adjudication of any other right in regard to which proceedings can or ought to
be taken under the Act has been completely taken away and the adjudication of these rights is to be
done by the consolidation authorities under and in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the
Rules made thereunder. Section 49 of the Act which bars the jurisdiction of the civil and revenue
Courts gives effect to the aforesaid provisions contained in Section 5(2) of the Act.
In order to answer the issues we will have to consider the provision, the scope and ambit of section
49 of the Act. The same provides for as follows:-
"49. Bar to civil jurisdiction-Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for
the time being in force, the declaration and adjudication of rights of tenure-holders in
respect of land lying in an area, for which a notification has been issued under
sub-section (2) of Section 4 or adjudication of any other right arising out of
consolidation proceedings and in regard to which a proceeding could or ought to have
been taken under this Act, shall be done in accordance with the provisions of this Act
and no civil or revenue court shall entertain any suit or proceeding with respect to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38040744/ 23Ram Briksha And Another vs Dy. Director Of Consolidation And 3 ... on 16 May, 2017
rights in such land or with respect to any other matters for which a proceeding could
or ought to have been taken under this Act."
From a bare perusal of the provisions of Section 49 of the Act it is evident that declaration and
adjudication of rights of tenure-holders in respect of land lying in an area for which a notification
has been issued under Section 4(2) and adjudication of any other right arising out of consolidation
proceedings and in regard to which a proceeding could or ought to have been taken under the Act,
had to be done in accordance with the provisions of the Act only and the jurisdiction of the civil or
revenue courts to entertain any suit or proceeding with respect to rights in such land or with respect
to any other matter for which a proceeding could or ought to have been taken under the Act, has
been taken away. The language used in Section 49 is of very wide amplitude and comprehensive.
Declaration and adjudication of rights of tenure-holders in respect of land lying in the area covered
by the notification under Section 4(2) of the Act and adjudication of any other right arising out of
consolidation proceedings and in regard to which a proceeding could or ought to have been taken
under the Act, would, on its face value, cover adjudication of questions as to title in respect of the
said lands. Such scheme of things also finds support from the other provisions of the Act and the
amendments that have been introduced therein.
As a result of these amendments civil and revenue Courts have no role in the matter of
determination of rights or interests in any land lying in the area for which notice has been issued
under Section 4(2) of the Act or for the declaration or adjudication of any other right in regard to
which proceedings can or ought to be taken under the Act.
The bar provided for under Section 49 of U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953 has been subject
matter of interpretation before the Apex Court time and again and in the case of Karbalai Begum vs.
Mohd. Sayeed and another AIR 1981 SC 77, a suit by a co-sharer to challenge deletion of her name in
joint Khewat in consolidation proceeding on the ground of fraud of other co-sharers in possession
has been held to be not barred under Section 49 of the Act and suit has been held to be maintainable
where dishonest cousins, looking after the lands of their brother's widow casted covetous eyes on
their sister-in-law's share with deplorable design seeking to deprive her of her legal share.
Apex Court in the case of Sita Ram vs. Chotta Bhonde AIR 1991 SC 249 elaborately considered
Section 49 of the Act 1953 and therein has held that the bar under Section 49 does not come into
play in context of consolidation proceedings itself, rather after the amendment in question has been
introduced declaration and adjudication of rights of tenure holders in respect of land lying in area
wherein notification has been issued under section 4(2) and adjudication of any other rights arising
out of consolidation proceedings in regard to which proceedings could or ought to have been
undertaken under the Act has to be done in accordance with the provisions of the Act only and the
jurisdiction of the Civil Courts or Revenue Courts to entertain any suit or proceedings with respect
to the rights in such land or with respect to any other land in which proceedings could or ought to
have been taken under the Act have been taken away. The claim set up by Respondent no.1 on the
basis that he is the son of Chota, brother of Nanhu and that the lands were recorded in the name of
Nanhu in representative capacity on behalf of himself and his other brothers fell within the ambit of
Section 5(2) had to be adjudicated by consolidation authorities, since it was matter falling within the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38040744/ 24Ram Briksha And Another vs Dy. Director Of Consolidation And 3 ... on 16 May, 2017
scope of adjudicatory functions assigned to consolidation authorities under the Act, the jurisdiction
of Civil Court to entertain the suit in respect of said matter was expressly barred by Section 49 of the
Act.
The language used in Section 49 is wide and comprehensive. Declaration and adjudication of rights
of tenure holders in respect of land lying in the area covered by notification under Section 4(2) of
the Act and adjudication of any other rights arising out of consolidation proceedings and in regard
to which proceedings could or ought to have been taken under the Act and would cover
interpretation of questions as to title in respect of the said lands.
Apex Court in the case of Narendra Singh and others vs. Jai Bhagwan AIR 2005 SC 582, followed
the dictum of Sita Ram (supra) while upholding the bar under Section 49 of U.P.C.H. Act by
mentioning that land being exclusively recorded in the name of the father, the sons who claim joint
ownership in the lands could and ought to have approached the authorities under the Act of 1953 for
getting them jointly recorded in revenue papers. Such proceedings for recording them as joint
owners having not been initiated under the 1953 Act, the High Court was right in invoking such a
plea in the suit in accordance with Section 49 of the Act. The argument that revenue entry in the
name of father should have been treated as in representative capacity for sons is misleading whether
the father was Karta and Manager of family and as such could be recorded in representative capacity
for all co-owners in the family was also a question of title which fell within exclusive jurisdiction of
authorities under the Act.
The object primarily appears to be allotting a compact area to the tenure holders in place of their
scattered plots and this much is also reflected that with the passage of time, the area of operation of
the aforementioned Act in question has been enhanced by providing that all such issues that can be
answered after notification has been issued under Section 4(2) in reference of adjudication of rights
arising out of consolidation proceedings be dealt with at one forum and declaration and
adjudication of rights of tenure holders in respect of land lying in the area covered by notification
under Section 4(2) of the Act and for adjudication of any other right arising out of consolidation
proceedings.
A Division Bench of our Court, in the case of Amar Singh vs. State of U.P. 2008 (104) RD 421, while
consider the issue as to whether suit filed was barred under Section 49 of the Act, held as follows:-
"The bar contained in Section 49 contemplates bar of entertainment of suit by a civil
or revenue court in respect of following:
(a) the declaration and adjudication of rights of tenure holders,
(b) adjudication of any other rights arising out of consolidation proceedings, and
(c) adjudication of any right in regard to which a proceeding could or ought to have
been taken under U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38040744/ 25Ram Briksha And Another vs Dy. Director Of Consolidation And 3 ... on 16 May, 2017
In view of the above, it is clear that any adjudication done with regard to land lying in the area in
which a notification under Section 4(2) of the U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953 has been
issued operates a bar of reagitating in any other revenue or civil Court. Second limb of Section also
creates a bar with regard to adjudication of any other right regarding which proceedings could or
ought to have been taken under U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953. The provision contains
the principles of res-judicata as well as principles of constructive res-judicata.
This Court in the case of Smt. Sudama v. Hansraj reported in 1981 R.D. 116 has again reiterated the
same view. The case of the appellant before the High Court was that defendant abused their position
in getting their name recorded as sole tenure holder by practising fraud on the plaintiff by
misrepresentation before the consolidation authorities. The court took the view that suit under
Section 229-B for declaration of the title was not barred. Following was observed by the Court:
"The revenue court while dealing with the suit for declaration can, on coming to the
finding that the entries made by the consolidation authorities were procured by fraud
and were wrong, declare the plaintiff's right as tenure holder and direct that the
entries be corrected accordingly."
Coming to the facts of the present case, the plaintiff's case was that the plot in dispute was
purchased through registered sale deed dated 17.3.1969 both by the plaintiff and defendant (writ
petitioner), who was co-sharer. The case of the plaintiff further was that it was the defendant
petitioner who was looking after the cases in the court and the plaintiff was living in forest being
Gaderiya looking after his goats, was duped by the defendant in removing his name from the
revenue record. The plaintiff has also claimed that after the sale deeds, both the parties came in
possession. A co-sharer who claim to be in possession of the property and his name being not
recorded in consolidation proceeding is not debarred from bringing a suit under Section 229-B for
correcting the entries and recording his name also if allegation is that his name was removed by
practising fraud on him. The judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Karbalai Begum and Smt.
Sudama (supra) fully supports the view taken by the courts below that suit is not barred under
Section 49 of the U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953.
There is one more aspect of the matter, which cannot be lost sight of. The plaintiff had come with
the case that both plaintiff and defendant purchased the property from a third person by a common
sale deed. The defendant vaguely denied the purchase of the property through sale deed but has not
come up with any case in the written statement as to what was the source of his title. The decision of
the trial court that since no case was filed in the consolidation court, the bar will not apply was not
sufficient to overrule the objection but the revisional court has considered the matter in detail and
has recorded positive finding that the name of the plaintiff was deleted by practising fraud on the
defendant hence, the bar of Section 49 will not apply. The suit is still pending adjudication before
the court below where final decision has to be taken after looking into the evidence and materials
which have come on the record. At the very out set, without even permitting the plaintiff to lead
evidence and to prove his case, throwing out the suit on the ground that the suit is barred by Section
49, is neither just nor legal. In view of the foregoing discussions, I do not find it a fit case for
interference in writ jurisdiction envisaged under Article 226 of the Constitution of India."

Section 49 of 1953 Act under the scheme of things provided for contemplates bar of entertainment
of suit by a Civil Court/Revenue Court in respect of right of tenure holder, however exception has
been carved out based on judicial pronouncement that when the name of a co-tenure holder could
not be recorded by practising fraud, the entries in consolidation proceeding can be challenged and
bar of Section 49 would not at all come into place since fraud vitiates even the most solemn
proceeding.
Once we have proceeded to examine the parameters of the provisions of Section 49 of the U.P.
Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953, the larger issue i.e. engaging our attention is as to whether an
incumbent, who otherwise has interest in property, looses his right in the property in question and
stands ousted from the property merely because he has not at all participated in the proceedings in
question.
In respect of right in land, the provisions of U.P. Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950
are self sufficient and the provisions of U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953 as already quoted
above had only limited role to play in respect to consolidation of agriculture holdings to facilitate
better quality of agriculture activities, whereas U.P. Act No.1 of 1951 deals with all aspects including
the acquisition of interest of intermediaries and its consequences, vesting of land for Gaon Sabha
and its superintendence, management of control of land etc by the Land Management Committee
and its tenural rights, classes of tenure, transfers, dissolution, division/ extension of rights, rent,
ejectment, conferment of rights etc. U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act at no point of time has ever
proceeded to deal with expansion of rights or with conferment of rights rather under the scheme of
things provided under U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, the existing rights over the land under
consolidation operation are only to be recognized under the provisions of U.P. Consolidation of
Holdings Act and nothing beyond the same. The U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act does not deal
with grant of authority to grant substantive rights to a tenure holder rather it is only empowered to
recognize the existing rights of tenure holder and in the said direction a full-fledged mechanism has
been provided for.
Landed property be it individually, jointly, or based on co-sharer confers rights over the property in
question and the said rights in question can be defeated or be taken away only in accordance with
law.
Apex Court in the case of N. Padmamma vs. S. Ramakrishna Reddy AIR 2008 SC 2834 held that a
right of property is a human right and also a constitutional right and the same cannot be taken away
except in accordance with law. Article 300-A of the Constitution protects such a right and as far as
U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953 is concerned, the purpose of the aforementioned Act is not
at all to divest an incumbent of such right keeping in view the provisions of Article 300-A of the
Constitution of India as its paramount object is to see that agricultural activity is to be carried out in
one area and in case at the point of time of constituting one compact are, in respect of one compact
area in case anyone has to raise any issue, he can come forward.
Apex Court, in the case of Rajiv Sarin vs. State of U.K. 2011 (8) SCC 708 while considering the
provisions of U.P.Z.A.L.R. Act alongwith K.U.Z.A.L.R. Act (Kumaun and Uttarakhand Zamindari
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38040744/ 27Ram Briksha And Another vs Dy. Director Of Consolidation And 3 ... on 16 May, 2017
Abolition and Land Reforms Act 1960) took the view where appellants' father had acquired in the
year 1945 propriety right in an estate which comprised of large tracts of forest spanning in and
around and where by Gazette notification dated 21.12.1977 under Section 4-A of K.U.Z.A.L.R. Act as
amended by U.P. Act No.15 of 1978, the rights, title and interest of hissedar in respect of forest land
situated in the specified areas ceased w.e.f. 01.01.1978 and the same were vested in the State
Government, qua the said forest land stand taken by the State that the right, title or interest of a
hissedar could be acquired without payment of compensation cannot be accepted as every hissedar
whose rights, title or interest are acquired under Section 4, shall be entitled to receive and paid
compensation. Said right has been recognised on the unveils of Article 300-A of the Constitution,
that ensures that persons should not be deprived of property save by authority of law. The scrutiny
of subject matter of U.P.C.H. Act clearly reflects that at no point of time endeavour under the said
Act has been to deprive a person of his property rather said legislation was directly linked with
agrarian reforms, an enactment under Schedule VII List II Entry 18 of "land".
Concious of this situation, mention has been made that right in the property in question is not at all
lost under the provisions of U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953, rather the forum to regain the
property in question is lost being barred by operation of law.
Once a right in property cannot be taken away except in accordance with law as Article 300-A of the
Constitution protects such right, in such a situation and in this background, the larger issue is that,
would in such a situation accepting for the purposes of case that the rights are there even then there
is loss of forum ?
At this juncture, the two Judgements of the Apex Court are being looked into.
Apex Court in the case of Amar Nath vs. Kewla Devi and another 2014 AIR SCW 3110 has clearly
ruled in reference of bar being placed under Section 49 of U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953
that where plaintiff claimed himself to be belonging to a common ancestor as defendant and then
order was passed against him by playing fraud and his right to be accorded as co-bhoomidhar in
revenue records cannot stand extinguished merely because he withdrew objection, the Apex Court
took the view that orders of consolidation officer suffers of legal malice as there is accepted
withdrawal of plaintiff's objection without examining evidence produced as to ownership of land
and bar under Section 49 has been held to be not attracted. Relevant extract of the said judgement
reads as follows:-
"We do not think it necessary to remit the matter back to the High Court for fresh
consideration. We feel it is sufficient to set aside the impugned judgment and uphold
the well-reasoned judgment of the first appellate court where it was held that the very
fact that the trial court held that it was proved that Amar Nath was s/o Vaij Nath
based on the evidence on record, then automatically the court should have given half
the portion of the disputed land to the appellant along with defendant no.1, Kewla
Devi. Instead, the trial court as well as the Consolidation Officer have passed
judgments that are bad in law as they have failed to see that the right of the appellant
cannot simply be extinguished because of the defendants' plea that he has entered
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38040744/ 28Ram Briksha And Another vs Dy. Director Of Consolidation And 3 ... on 16 May, 2017
into a compromise. The defendants have taken undue advantage of the appellant's
illiteracy and the Consolidation Officer has abdicated his role by allowing the
objection of the appellant to be withdrawn and by not examining whether or not the
appellant was indeed the S/o Vaij Nath who was the S/o Gaya. The order of the
Consolidation Officer is thus bad in law and it has resulted in a grave miscarriage of
justice. We think it fit to restore the judgment and decree passed by the first appellate
court wherein the court declared that the appellant, Amar Nath is S/o Vaij Nath who
was son of Gaya thereby holding that the order passed by the Consolidation Officer is
void and illegal and the trial court was wrong in not quashing the order of the
Consolidation Officer and that nowhere in the revenue record was his name recorded
and fraud was committed against him as defendant no.1, Kewla Devi has got her
name recorded in each and every revenue record. The judgment of the first appellate
court is legal and valid as it is fair and keeping with the principles of justice. The trial
court in its answer to issue nos. 1 and 10 has rightly held that Amar Nath is S/o Vaij
Nath who was undisputedly the son of Gaya and if that fact was proved, then we see
no reason why it was not directed for the appellant's name to be recorded in the
revenue records. The right of the appellant over the suit schedule property cannot be
extinguished simply because objection was withdrawn, over which there is a cloud of
doubt anyway and also, the appellant has pleaded that he had no idea about the order
of the Consolidation Officer in the first place. We find it highly likely that fraud was
committed on him by the defendants as well as the Consolidation Officer by not
recording his name in the revenue records as the defendants have taken undue
advantage of his illiteracy so that the whole property goes to the defendants.
10. Answer to point no.2:
The question whether the original suit of the appellant was barred under Section 49
of the UP Consolidation of Land Holdings Act and Section 331 of the UP Zamindari
Abolition and Land Reforms Act, we answer in the negative. The suit was not barred
under the aforesaid provisions as the UP Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act
has no jurisdiction to deal with the subject matter. On the issue of Section 49 of the
UP Consolidation of Land Holdings Act, we hold that the present case is not barred
under this section as it is a suit for possession of the suit schedule property based on
title, which is not within the jurisdiction of the authorities under the aforesaid Act. In
the case of Suba Singh v. Mahendra Singh & Ors., it was observed by this Court that
Section 49 does not bar jurisdiction of civil courts in matters of title to the land
stating that -
"9. ...The result is that the plea of bar of the civil courts' jurisdiction to investigate and
adjudicate upon the title to the land or the sonship of the plaintiff has no
substance...."
Therefore, since the present case too involves a question of ''sonship' of the plaintiff who is the
appellant herein, there is no bar to the jurisdiction of civil courts under Section 49 of the aforesaid
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38040744/ 29Ram Briksha And Another vs Dy. Director Of Consolidation And 3 ... on 16 May, 2017
Act, in deciding the question of the appellant's right to the land he has inherited from his father.
11. Answer to point nos.3 & 4:
The order of the Consolidation Officer dated14.2.1970 was obtained on the basis of
fraud by the defendants. We feel that the Consolidation Officer has also committed
fraud on the appellant, by accepting withdrawal of his objection and not going into
the issue of whether he is the s/o Vaij Nath or not, and therefore whether he is the
rightful heir, with a right in half-share of the disputed property. The Consolidation
Officer has not discharged his duties properly and keeping with law has not given
details of the objection or why the objection was not pressed by the appellant in his
order. He has permitted a gross miscarriage of justice to continue by recording of the
name of defendant no.1 as the only rightful heir to the land in dispute. In the case of
S. Partap Singh v. State of Punjab, Ayyangar J. in his portion of the judgment at para
6 has quoted Lord Denning (in the case Lazarus Estates Ltd. v. Beasley 1956 1 All ER
341 at p.345) stating:
"No judgment of a Court, no order of a Minister can be allowed to stand if it has been
obtained by fraud."
Apex Court in the case of N. Padmamma and others vs. S. Ramakrishna Reddy and others 2015 (1)
SCC 417 has taken the view that in property law right of one party cannot be defeated. Relevant
extract of the said judgments is as follows:-
"It is fairly well settled principle of law that the possession of a co-heir is in law
treated as possession of all the co-heirs. If one co-heir has come in possession of the
properties, it is presumed to be on the basis of a joint title. A co-heir in possession
cannot render its possession adverse to other co-heirs not in possession, merely by
any secret hostile animus on his own part, in derogation of the title of his other
co-heirs. Ouster of the other co-heirs must be evidenced by hostile title coupled by
exclusive possession and enjoyment of one of them to the knowledge of the other. See
Corea v. Appuhamy 1912 AC 230(PC).
Reference may also be made to the decision of this Court in P. Lakshmi Reddy v. L.
Lakshmi Reddy AIR 1957 SC 314 where this Court has succinctly summed up the
legal position as under:
"But it is well-settled that in order to establish adverse possession of one co-heir as
against another it is not enough to show that one out of them is in sole possession
and enjoyment of the profits of the properties. Ouster of the non-possessing co-heir
by the co-heir in possession who claims his possession to be adverse, should be made
out. The possession of one co-heir is considered, in law, as possession of all the
co-heirs. When one co-heir is found to be in possession of the properties it is
presumed to be on the basis of joint title. The coheir in possession cannot render his
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38040744/ 30Ram Briksha And Another vs Dy. Director Of Consolidation And 3 ... on 16 May, 2017
possession adverse to the other co-heir, not in possession. merely by any secret
hostile animus on his own part in derogation of the other co-heir's title. It is a settled
rule of law that as between co-heirs there must be evidence of open assertion of
hostile title, coupled with exclusive possession and enjoyment by one of them to the
knowledge of the other so as to constitute ouster."
On these parameters, the issues that have been raised before us are being considered and in our
considered opinion rights of the parties in a holding cannot be permitted to be defeated merely
because they have not at all participated in consolidation proceedings and as to whether the bar of
Section 49 of U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953 would be attracted or not would essentially
be a question of fact that can be answered on the basis of evidence adduced and to the said bar in
question exceptions have to be carved out wherein suit in question would be not barred and Section
49 of U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953 would not come into play where from the series of
documents and circumstances it is reflected that planned fraud has been made to delete the
plaintiffs name from the revenue records. From the record of the consolidations, it is clearly
reflected that neither the incumbent, who has proceeded to get his name recorded nor consolidation
authorities have proceeded to discharge their duties faithfully in consonance with the provisions of
U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act wherein the consolidation authorities are empowered to
ascertain the share of each owner if there be more owners than one and in case such an exercise has
not been undertaken, then it would be a case of legal malice and it cannot be ipso facto presumed
that there has been ouster from the property in question and in such a situation an incumbent, who
claims his right in the property in question has got every right to regain his property based on title
for the reason that the right has been sought to be defeated based on fraud and manipulation.
The provisions of Section 49 of U.P. Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953 in such backdrop would
not at all be attracted and the suit in question would not at all be prima facie barred where suit in
question is filed for possession of the suit property based on property interest. The reference is
answered as follows Issue No.I Whether use of words "could or ought to have been taken" in latter
part of Section 49 of the Act, compulsorily forces the co-sharers, who are living jointly, peacefully
and have no grievance against their father/brother/co-sharer, whose name is recorded in
representative capacity, or they were willing to live jointly, due to situation of their family, i.e.
(father and minor son), (mother and minor son), (brother and minor brother) and (some co-sharer
was student and had gone abroad for study and fully depends upon other co-sharers) etc., to file an
objection under Section 9 of the Act for separation of his share?
A. Because of the words "could or ought to have been taken" in latter part of Section 49 of the Act,
same does not compulsorily forces the co-sharers, who are living jointly, peacefully and have no
grievance against their father/brother/co-sharer whose name is recorded in representative capacity
or they were willing to live jointly due to situation of their family and who have not filed an objection
under Section 49 of the Act for separation of their share inasmuch as under the provisions of U.P.
Consolidation of Holdings Act, 1953, it is the statutory obligation cast upon the authorities and the
incumbent, who has been holding the property in question in the representative capacity to get the
records corrected and in case in designed manner the obligation in question has not been
discharged by Consolidation Authorities as well as by the incumbent holding the property in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/38040744/ 31Ram Briksha And Another vs Dy. Director Of Consolidation And 3 ... on 16 May, 2017
representative capacity, then in such a situation Section 49 of the Act would not at all be attracted
and such situation would be covered under the contingency of planned fraud to drop the name of
other co-sharers from the revenue records.
Issue No.II Whether by operation of law, the parties can be thrown into litigation against their
will/need and by not raising claim to land or partition and separation of the chak their right to
property can be taken away in spite of protection available under Article 19 (1) (f) and now Article
300-A of the Constitution?
A. The answer is that a party cannot be thrown in litigation against their will/need and by not
raising claim to land of partition and separation of chak, their rights to property cannot be taken
away under the protection provided for under Article 19(1)(f)/ Article 300-A of the Constitution of
India.
Issue No.III Whether, in spite of well settled legal principle in respect of joint property, right of a
co-sharer will come to an end under Section 49 of the Act, on the notification under Section 52, due
to not claiming partition of his share and separate chak in his name, although, there had been no
ouster from joint property?
A. The rights of the co-sharers will not at all come to an end under Section 49 of the Act, on the
notification under Section 52 due to not claiming partition of his share and separate chak in his
name and till there is no ouster from the joint property his right in the property will continue to
exist.
The reference is accordingly answered. The Writ Petition alongwith connected matters shall now be
placed before the appropriate Bench according to roster for disposal in light of this judgement.
