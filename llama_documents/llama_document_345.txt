whom it is made. It is not in dispute that only the firms were party to the contracts. It was
contended that Section 47 read with Section 49 of the Act will have bearing on the
proceedings inasmuch as, individuals are not party to the proceedings and therefore
foreign awards would not be binding on them.

appearing for the respondent that the damages would mean the damages immediate

such loss can be awarded as damages and nothing beyond loss. It was contended that it being back
to back contract which was known to the petitioner and not having gone in the
market cannot be permitted to profiteer as if they have suffered damage of the profit as well
and this fundamental basis can be considered only if the contract is performed. It was
therefore contended that these facts would shock the
conscience of the Court and it is against equity and fairness.
32. Relying upon the judgment of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court reported in 2015 Bombay

would not have made if the contract would have been executed. It was contended that
it is a penalty and therefore, this Court may not entertain these petitions on the

under section 49 of the Act and therefore, this Court may be pleased to reject these petitions.
36. Mr. Mehul S. Shah, learned Senior Counsel HC-NIC Page 16 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12
13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER appearing for the respective respondents has
taken this Court through the judgments of the Apex Court in Renu Sagar (supra) and
has contended as under −
37. That Sections 34 and 48 of the Act were similar and the judgments of the Apex Court in
Shri Lal Mahal Ltd. (supra) clarified the situation and provided for test and guide as
well as the parameters to be followed as to what would be
against public policy of Indian law, morality and justice.
38. It was further contended that looking at the awards as it is, it cannot be said
that the respondents are liable under damages and such damages could ever be
awarded. It was further contended that keeping in mind both rationality and principles of
damages, the impugned awards cannot be executed as the same are not accepted
by the Indian law and in the instant case, the test provided by the aforesaid judgments are
apparently not fulfilled and allowing the award as it is, it would be allowing unjust enrichment
of the award once it is deemed to be decree of this Court and that valid and germane defence is
available to the respondents before the awards are considered to be decree.
39. Referring to the emails, which in fact have been referred to by Mr. Soparkar, it was
contended that the actual loss is lesser than what is HC-NIC Page 17 of 96 Created On Sat

award of damages in such contract matter is to mitigate the loss and on facts, it has
been found that only deposits have been forfeited.
40. Relying upon the judgments of the Apex Court in the cases of Centrotrade Minerals & Metal
I n c . v . H i n d u s t a n C o p p e r L t d . , r e p o r t e d i n ( 2 0 1 7 ) 2
SCC 228, Maula Bux v. Union of India reported in (1969) 2 SCC 554 and Fateh Chand v.
Balkishan Dass reported in AIR 1963 SC 1405, Mr. Shah contended that no evidence is
led for actual loss. It was further contended by Mr. Shah,
learned counsel appearing for the respondent that it is not permissible for any judicial authority
t o a w a r d d a m a g e s b y j u s t a p p l y i n g s o m e m e a s u r e s
suggested by the claimants which may be applied for in given facts of the case that there
is definite pleading, evidence and finding. It was contended that if that is not so, the authority
h a s t o f i n d o u t a c t u a l d a m a g e s f r o m t h e f a c t s
resulting from the breach of the contract. It was therefore contended that this is not a fit case
for considering the impugned award as decree of this Court.
41. Mr. Rashesh S. Sanjanwala learned senior counsel assisted by Mr. Sahil M. Shah, learned
counsel has adopted the arguments adopted by Mr. Soparkar and Mr. Mehul Shah, learned
senior counsels appearing for the respective respondents.

42. The learned counsels appearing for the respective respondents have also further contended
that it is found from the record that there were 13 contracts for which notice for
arbitration has been given. It was further pointed out that pursuant to the said
notice, reference was so made and the Tribunal was constituted and the Tribunal has
proceeded only in reference to 9 cases and other cases are remaining. It was further
contended that the claims sought to be raised by similar companies are common, but
in five cases, it has come on record. It was further contended that the 14 cases
could have been simultaneously decided. It was contended
that there would have been all chances of award, which are likely to have contradictory findings
on merits as well as in law though arising from similar contract, stipulation and same date. It
was apprehended that there would be likelihood of contradiction on merits and in law. It
was further pointed out that the petitioner has sought for extension of time for
production of documents and therefore pursuant to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42103228/ 11Oci Corporation vs Kandla Export Corporation & 2 on 8 August, 2017
extension, if now these cases are taken up, the resultant effect in law would be that again there
would be contradictory findings and therefore, the present petitions are premature.
43. Mr. Mihir J. Thakore, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner in his further reply
has HC-NIC Page 19 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER
contended as under −
44. That prima facie, the awards are just and proper.
45. That the issues which are raised cannot be looked into.
46. Referring to the proposal e−mail dated 12.06.2012, 16.07.2012 as well as email
dated 21.07.2012, it was contended that there was no response.
47. Referring to the same from the awards in origin, it was contended that as noted by the Tribunal,
t h e p r o p o s a l s w e r e g i v e n t o r e s o l v e t h e m a t t e r
and it was contended that the Tribunal has read the same and that all such offers were
without prejudice offers to resolve the issue and the
same cannot be seen at the stage of enforcement of the award.

section 51(2) and 51(3) of the U.K. Sale of Goods Act, contended that the same has been considered
by the Tribunal as well as in the appeal award and even the aspect of actual loss in light of the
provision of section 51(3) has been considered by the Arbitral appellate Tribunal and
the same is overruled. Referring to para 10.15 of the award, Mr. Thakore contended that the aspect
of back to back contract is concluded by the Tribunal and the Tribunal has come to
the HC-NIC Page 20 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER
definite conclusion that the contract in question were not "inextricably linked"and that the case
is governed by section 51(3)of the U.K. Sale of Goods Act. It is further contended by Mr.
Thakore, learned counsel for the petitioner that these findings given by the Arbitration Tribunal as
well as the appellate Tribunal are given on interpretation of the facts under English law.
49. It was contended that as per the provisions of the Act and even as provided
under sections 28 and 48 of the Act, this Court cannot entail
review on merits and same is not contemplated by the Act and this Court also cannot challenge the

Mr. Thakore also relied upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the case of ONGC v. Saw
Pipes reported in 2003(5) SCC 705.
50. Mr. Thakore further contended that the issue of damages has been considered by the
Tribunal in detail as per the clauses. It was also further contended that section 69 of
the English Arbitration Act, 1996 provides for an appeal on the point of law and sub−section
(2) thereof provides for leave of the Court which prescribes
that appeal would be with the leave of the Court when it found that the award is obviously wrong. It

Queen's Division Bench of London High Court, the first question to be considered as per
the HC-NIC Page 21 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER
English law was whether requirement of sections 69(3)(a) & (b) are made out or not
and the Hon'ble Bench has come to the conclusion that the decision of the Board was not
obviously wrong. It was therefore contended that on such satisfaction only High Court
can deal with the matter.

conclusion the there are no special circumstances as to why section 51(3) of the UK Sale of Goods
Act should not be applied and the petitioner has lost market value of the goods. Referring to the
judgment of the review before the High Court as well as to the Court of appeal, it was contended by
Mr. Thakore that the proceedings ended in England.
52. Mr. Thakore contended that the judgment of the Apex Court in Saw Pipe (supra)
clarifies the distinct jurisdiction between sections 34 and
section 48 of the Act and the same is in context with the provisions of section 34 of the Act and
the Hon'ble Court was quite conscious of the fact that the judgment of three judges cannot
be overruled.

53. Referring to the judgment in the case of Renu Sagar (supra), Mr. Thakore
contended that the contention that the award is contrary to the
English law is not available. Mr. Thakore also further contended that whether section 51(2) of
the English law or 51(3) of the English law should be applied cannot be looked into by this
Court nor it would enable any party to argue the same. Referring further to the observations made
in the case of Renu Sagar (supra), it was contended that the argument that it is a case of
unjust enrichment is also not permissible. Mr. Thakore also contended that the parties have
agreed to English law and it is analysed accordingly.
54. Mr. Thakore contended that section 21 of the Arbitration Act is in part I of the
Act and applies only to domestic arbitration and international arbitration in India and
no exceptions are carved out in respect of foreign awards. Mr. Thakore further submitted

further contended that this Court cannot go into the correctness of the award and the

55. Mr. Thakore further contended that the other contentions raised as regards
profiteering that the Tribunal has given more than six times than
what is suffered by the petitioner and that the award is against the fundamental policy of Indian
law, morality and justice, is to be given a narrow meaning once the Tribunal has
correctly examined as per the English law and found that no further enquiry would be
necessary. It was therefore submitted that this Court may be
pleased to hold that the awards in question are enforceable and are not against the provisions of
section 48(2) of the Act and declare it to be decree of this Court.
56. Mr. Mihir Thakore, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has also relied upon the

57. It was further contended that even the reliance HC-NIC Page 24 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12
13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER placed upon the judgment of Bunge vs. Nidera of
the Queen's Bench was found by the Bench that the said case would not apply to the
arbitration proceedings before GAFTA. Referring to section 48(1)(a), 48(1)(b)(c)(d)(e) as
well as section 48(2)(a), section 48(2)(b) of the Act, it was
submitted that the scope of inquiry by this Court would not permit or allow a review on merits of
the dispute and the scope of inquiry on the ground of public policy under section 48 of the
Act in relation to foreign award is much narrower than public policy as contained under section 34
of the Act, which deals with domestic awards and not foreign awards.

the awards was induced by fraud or corruption or is violative of sections 75 or 81 of the Act, or the

basic notions of morality and justice can be reviewed by this Court. It was further submitted
that on the contrary, it has been provided that whether there is contravention in the
public policy in Indian shall not entail a review on the merits of the dispute. Thus, the
scope and purview of section 48 is very limited.

Ltd. reported in (2017) SCC Online Del. 7810 and other decisions of various High Court to buttress
his argument that mere violation of provision of Indian law would not amount to violation
of fundamental policy of India. It has been contended that the respondents have failed
to demonstrate that the awards amount to violation fundamental policy of India and
merely because the Tribunal has held that section 51(3) of the HC-NIC Page 27 of 96 Created On
Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER UK Sale of Goods Act applies, which
is a different measure of determination of loss, it cannot be said that the awards are

therefore, it was contended that the enforcement of the award would not be against the most basic
principles of justice and morality. The learned counsel for the petitioner has further relied
upon the judgments of the Bombay High Court as well as Delhi High Court in the case of
Etizen Bulk & Ashapura Minechem Ltd (2016(2) ArbLR 113(Bom), M/s. Lois Dreyfus
Commodities v. Sakuma Exports Ltd (2015 6 Bom CR 258), Sideralba S.P. A v. Shree

or unjust enrichment amounts to a review of the merits of the disputes and is beyond the scope of

13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER submitted by the learned counsel for the
petitioner that 9 Arbitration Awards are appropriate, just and proper and enforceable
under the Indian law.
67. Mr. Soparkar, learned counsel for the respondents has reiterated the arguments which were
already canvassed. Mr. Soparkar further contended that the present awards are not merely
v i o l a t i v e o f S e c t i o n 7 3 o f t h e I n d i a n C o n t r a c t A c t b u t i t i s
also such that it would shock the conscience of the Court and has given further example, which is
enumerated as below − If A agrees to sell the goods to B at Rs.95
and B would be selling it further to C, to make a profit of Rs.3 on it, and deposits
Rs.2 with C as security; then in the event of default by A, B ought to be awarded a
maximum compensation of Rs.5 (i.e. Rs. 3 towards loss of profit and Rs.2 towards
forfeiture of deposit by C). However, if B is awarded a compensation of Rs.105, by
calculating the difference between the market price (say Rs. 200 on the date of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42103228/ 16Oci Corporation vs Kandla Export Corporation & 2 on 8 August, 2017
default) and the contract price (i.e. Rs.95), the B would be making a colossal
profit out of the breach of contract by A, which cannot be permitted. Even if the contract
would have been performed by A, then B would have earned profit of Rs.3 and
not Rs.105. Grant of Rs.105 to B, would be something which would shock the conscience
of this Hon'ble Court and would be against the public policy of India.

limitation imposed by the legislature is not to enter into merits of the award. However, this
C o u r t h a s j u r i s d i c t i o n t o d e t e r m i n e w h e t h e r t h e
foreign award is violative of fundamental policy of India or not and further it was contended that

award by this Court and that this Court has jurisdiction to test the award on the ground of
morality and justice and this Court has to decide as to what would be just and moral.

(b) the enforcement of the award would be contrary to the public policy of India.
Explanation 1.--For the avoidance of any doubt, it is clarified that an award is in
conflict with the public policy of India, only if,−
(i)the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption or was in
violation of section 75 or section 81; or
(ii)it is in contravention with the fundamental policy of Indian law; or
(iii)it is in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or justice.
Explanation 2.− For the avoidance of doubt, the test as to whether there is a contravention
with the fundamental policy of Indian law shall not entail a review on the merits of the dispute.
(3) If an application for the setting aside or suspension of the award has been
made to a competent authority referred to in clause (e) of sub−section (1) the Court may, if it
considers it proper, adjourn the decision on the enforcement of the
award and may also, on the application of the party claiming enforcement of the award,
order the other party to give suitable security."

approached the Court of appeal in London against the order passed by the Hon'ble Queen's

Court of appeal in London refused the appeal against the order dated 14.07.2015 and also
disallowed the plea of the respondents to prefer an appeal before the
Supreme Court of United Kingdom.

76. It may be noted that section 47 lays down the procedural requirement, which the
party has applied for enforcement of a foreign award and such provision is based
upon Article IV of Newyork Convention. It also deserves to be noted that before effective

77. In light of the aforesaid therefore, it cannot be said that the conditions of the said sections are
not satisfied.

learned counsel appearing for the parties and on perusal of the record and proceedings as well as
the judgments which are relied upon by the learned counsel appearing for the
respective parties, it is an admitted position that the parties entered into a contract for
supply of Indian Rapeseed Meal and in the arbitration
clause, it is clearly provided that the seat of arbitration would be at London and it would
be according to the GAFTA 125 Arbitration Rules and the same would be governed by English law.
79. Both the sides have taken this Court to the relevant observations made by the
learned Arbitrators as well as Arbitral Board. The contention raised by the respondent
t h a t a c t u a l l o s s i s f a r l e s s t h a n w h a t i s g r a n t e d i s t o b e

entirely touches the merits of the case. As far as merits are concerned, the same cannot be re−

findings given are on interpretation of facts of the case and as per the English law and
this Court cannot review the same on merits and its validity cannot be examined by
this Court in these proceedings and thus, as per the agreement
between the parties, for applicability of English law, the same is analysed by the Courts in
England.
80. Therefore, in opinion of this Court, the awards in question which are foreign awards can

the Act that while examining whether there is contravention with the fundamental

contended that the High Court of Justice Queen's Division Commercial Court has not confirmed
the findings of the Tribunal as well as the arbitration appellate board, but has
refused leave as it was found that the Tribunal was not obviously wrong. At this juncture,
reference be made to the provisions of section 69 of the UK Arbitration Act, which provides
for leave to appeal. From bare reading of the order of the Queen's Bench Division Court of
appeal, it is observed that the awards were not obviously HC-NIC Page 39 of 96 Created

that the awards have not become final and thus, the appeal

per the English law the awards have become final. The facts clearly establish that the

8 2 . T h e o b j e c t i o n s r a i s e d b y t h e l e a r n e d c o u n s e l f o r
the respondents are on the following grounds in light of the provisions of section 48 of the Act−
1. That the impugned awards are against the fundamental public policy of Indian law.
2. The awards are in contravention to the public policy of Indian law.
3. That the awards are against the basic principles of morality and justice and are in
flagrant and gross breach of the same.
4. That it is such that it would shock the conscience of this Court.
5. That the awards are exhaustive in nature and no one can profit from breach of the contract and
is against the provisions of section 73 of the Indian Contract Act and violative of fundamental
policy of Indian law.
6. That the damages which are awarded are more HC-NIC Page 40 of 96 Created On Sat Aug

this group of petitions and as contended by the learned counsel appearing for the respondents in
particular, this Court is therefore called upon to examine on the aspect that the enforcement of
the awards in question would be contrary to public policy of India. It is also further
contended by the learned counsel for the respondents based upon the provisions of section
4 8 ( 2 ) E x p l a n a t i o n 1 c l a u s e ( 2 ) t h a t t h e i m p u g n e d
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42103228/ 23Oci Corporation vs Kandla Export Corporation & 2 on 8 August, 2017
awards are in contravention with the fundamental policy of India and clause (3), that it is
in conflict with basic notion of morality and justice. Section 48 came to be amended
and Explanations 1 and 2 as it stands today, have been substituted by Act 3 of 2016
w.e.f. 23.10.2015 and explanation 2 further provides that the test as to whether there
i s c o n t r a v e n t i o n w i t h t h e f u n d a m e n t a l p o l i c y o f
Indian law shall not entail a review on merits of the dispute.
84. The first limb of argument which is put forward by the learned counsel for the respondents is to
the effect that the impugned awards are contrary to the public policy of India. The basis
for HC-NIC Page 41 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER
that contention is that the awards prescribe for more than actual loss. It is also further
contended that the High Court of Justice Queen's Division Commercial Court has only refused
t o e n t e r t a i n t h e a p p e a l o n l y b y h o l d i n g t h a t t h e
view taken by the arbitral board is not obviously wrong. It is also contended that the
impugned awards are violative of Indian law inasmuch as
that against direct loss of 3 million dollars and total consequential loss of 5 million dollars for
14 contracts, the petitioner is being compensated by damages in sum of 13 million dollars
for 9 contracts and the same is fundamentally in violation of Indian jurisprudence
wherein compensation is always to make good damages suffered and not profiteering.
8 5 . I n f u r t h e r a n c e o f t h e s a i d c o n t e n t i o n i t i s a l s o
c o n t e n d e d b y t h e r e s p o n d e n t s t h a t i f t h e i m p u g n e d
awards are permitted to be implemented then the same would amount to unjust enrichment.
It was also further contended that though the petitioner has not gone to market, cannot be
permitted to profiteer and as it was back to back contract,
only loss of profit can be awarded and therefore, it is against the fundamental policy of
Indian law and also against morality and justice. The
respondents have also contended that it is also in breach of section 73 of the Indian
C o n t r a c t A c t a n d t h e r e f o r e i t i s i n v i o l a t i o n o f
fundamental policy of Indian law and the awards HC-NIC Page 42 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12
13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER are exhaustive in nature which would shock the
conscience of this Court. Relying upon the judgments which are dealt with in this judgment
separately, it is contended that it is not permissible for any judicial authority to award
d a m a g e s b y j u s t a p p l y i n g t h e s a m e m e a s u r e
suggested by the claimant which may be applied in given facts of case and in fact the actual
damages found on such appreciation of evidence only be granted.
86. Over and above, it is evident from the contentions which are raised by the
respondents that they have on basis of the findings arrived at by the Arbitration Tribunal as
well as appellate board, it is contended that the impugned awards are against the
fundamental policy of Indian law and therefore, are not
enforceable and cannot be deemed to be a decree of this Court and the petitions are
therefore required to be dismissed.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42103228/ 24Oci Corporation vs Kandla Export Corporation & 2 on 8 August, 2017
87. The aforesaid contentions are denied by the learned counsel for the petitioner and
i t i s c o n t e n d e d t h a t t h e s c o p e o f i n q u i r y u n d e r s e c t i o n
48 of the Act is limited and the same does not allow a review of the merits of the dispute. It
is also contended that mere violation of sections 73 and 74 of the Indian Contract Act would not
amount to violation of fundamental policy of Indian law. It is also contended that
the HC-NIC Page 43 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER
contentions raised by the respondents that the awards would allow unjust enrichment
and would allow review of the merits is wholly misplaced
and therefore, it is contended that 9 arbitration awards are appropriate, just and proper and
enforceable under Indian law. Thus, this Court cannot review the awards on merits.
8 8 . L e a r n e d c o u n s e l f o r t h e p e t i t i o n e r h a s r e l i e d
upon the judgment of the Apex Court rendered in the case of Fuerst Day Lawson Ltd. Vs.
Jindal Exports Ltd., reported in [(2001) 6 SCC 356], wherein the Apex Court in paragraphs
31 and 32 has observed thus:− "31. Prior to the enforcement of the Act,
the Law of Arbitration in this country was substantially contained in three enactments namely (1)
The Arbitration Act, 1940, (2) The Arbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act, 1937
and (3) The Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961. A
party holding a foreign award was required to take recourse to these enactments. Preamble
of the Act makes it abundantly clear that it aims at to consolidate and amend Indian
laws relating to domestic arbitration, international commercial arbitration and
enforcement of foreign arbitral awards. The object of the Act is to minimize supervisory role
of court and to give speedy justice. In this view, the stage
of approaching court for making award a rule of court as required in Arbitration Act,
1940 is dispensed with in the present Act. If the argument of the respondent is
accepted, one of the objects of the Act will be frustratedand defeated. Under the old Act,
after making award and prior to HC-NIC Page 44 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST
2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER execution, there was a procedure for filing
and making an award a rule of court i.e. a decree. Since the object of the act is to provide
speedy and alternative solution of the dispute, the same procedure cannot be insisted
under the new Act when it is advisedly eliminated. If separate proceedings are to be
taken, one for deciding the enforceability of a foreign award and the other thereafter
for execution, it would only contribute to protracting the litigation and adding to the
sufferings of a litigant in terms of money, time and energy. Avoiding such difficulties
is one of the objects of the Act as can be gathered from the scheme of the Act and
particularly looking to the provisions contained in Sections 46 to 49 in relation
to enforcement of foreign award. In para 40 of the Thyssen judgment already extracted
above, it is stated that as a matter of fact, there is not much difference between
the provisions of the 1961 Act and the Act in the matter of enforcement of foreign
award. The only difference as found is that while under the Foreign Award Act a decree
follows, under the new Act the foreign award is already stamped as the decree. Thus, in
our view, a party holding foreign award can apply for enforcement of it but the court
before taking further effective steps for the execution of the award has to proceed in
accordance with Sections 47 to 49. In one proceeding there may be different stages. In
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42103228/ 25Oci Corporation vs Kandla Export Corporation & 2 on 8 August, 2017
the first stage the Court may have to decide about the enforceability of the award having regard to
the requirement of the said provisions. Once the court decides that
foreign award is enforceable, it can proceed to take further effective steps for execution of
the same. There arises no question of making foreign award as a rule of court/decree again.
If the object and purpose can be served in the same
proceedings, in our view, there is no need to take two separate proceedings resulting HC-NIC
Page 45 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER in multiplicity of
litigation. It is also clear from objectives contained in para 4 of the St atement of Objects
a n d R e a s o n s , S e c t i o n s 4 7 t o 4 9 a n d S c h e m e o f t h e A c t t h a t
every final arbitral award is to be enforced as if it were a decree of the court. The
submission that the execution petition could not be permitted to convert as an application
under Section 47 is technical and is of no consequence in the view we have taken. In our
opinion, for enforcement of foreign award there is no need to take separate
proceedings, one for deciding the enforceability of the award to make rule of
the court or decree and the other to take up execution thereafter. In one proceeding, as
already stated above, the court enforcing a foreign award can deal with the entire
matter. Even otherwise, this procedure does not prejudice a party in the light of what is stated in
para 40 of the Thyssen judgment.
32. Part II of the Act relates to enforcement of certain foreign awards.
Chapter 1 of this Part deals with New York Convention Awards. Section 46 of the Act speaks
as to when a foreign award is binding. Section 47 states as to what evidence the
party applying for the enforcement of a foreign award should
produce before the court. Section 48 states as to the conditions for enforcement of foreign
awards. As per Section 49, if the Court is satisfied that a foreign award is enforceable under
this Chapter, the award shall be deemed to be a decree of that court and that court has to
proceed further to execute the foreign award as a decree of that court. If the
argument advanced on behalf of the respondent is accepted, the
very purpose of the Act in regard to speedy and effective execution of foreign award will be
defeated. Thus none of the contentions urged on behalf of the
respondent merit acceptance so as to uphold the impugned judgment and order. We have no
HC-NIC Page 46 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER
hesitation or impediment in concluding that the impugned judgment and order cannot be
sustained."
89. The Apex Court in the case of Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. (Supra), has observed thus:−
40. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the enforcement of the Arbitral award is not barred by
S. 7(1)(a)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act on the ground that Renusagar was unable to present
its case before the Arbitral Tribunal.
III. Objection to the Enforceability of the Award on the Ground that it is Contrary to
the Public Policy of the State of New York.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42103228/ 26Oci Corporation vs Kandla Export Corporation & 2 on 8 August, 2017
41. Shri Venugopal has urged that although under sub−clause (b) of clause (2) of Art. V of the
New York Convention the recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award can be refused if
the competent authority in the country where recognition and enforcement is sought finds
that the recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary
to the public policy of that country, i.e., the country where the award is sought to be enforced, a
departure has been made in S. 7(i)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act which
prescribes that the foreign award may not be enforced under the said Act if the Court
dealing with the case is satisfied that the enforcement of the award would be contrary to
public policy. The submission of Shri Venugopal is that in S. 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Act. the
Parliament has deliberately refrained from using the words "public policy of India"
which implies that the words "public policy" are not restricted to
the public policy of India but would cover the public policy of the country whose law governs the
contract or of the country of the place of arbitration and the enforcement of an award
would be refused if it is HC-NIC Page 47 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017
O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER contrary to such public policy. In this context Shri Venugopal
has invited our attention to the provisions of S. 7(1) of the Arbitration (Protocol and
Convention) Act, 1937 wherein the words used are "and
enforcement thereof must not be contrary to the public policy or law of india".
According to Shri Venugopal while under the 1937 Act, objections to enforcement are
limited to the public policy of India or law of India, there is no such limitation in S.
7(l)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act. Shri Venugopal has also placed reliance on the decision
of this Court in V/o Tractoroexport. Moscow v. Tarapore and Co., (1970) 3 SCR 53 : (AIR
1971 SC 1) wherein this Court has held that there was clear deviation from the rigid and
strict rule that the courts must stay a suit whenever an international commercial arbitration
as contemplated by the Protocol and the Conventions, was to take place and that it
was open to the legislature to deviate from the terms of the Protocol and the Convention and that
it appears to have given only a limited effect to the provisions of the 1958 Convention. We
find it difficult to accept this contention. It cannot be held that by
not using the words "Public policy of India"
and only using the words "public policy" in S. 7(l)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards
Act, Parliament intended to 'deviate from the provisions of the New York
Convention contained in Art. V(2)(b) which uses the words "public policy
of that country"
implying public policy of the country where recognition and enforcement is sought. That
Parliament did not intend to deviate from the terms of the New York Convention is
borne out by the amendment which was introduced in the Act by Act 47 of 1973
after the decision of this Court in Tractoroexport case (supra) whereby S. 3 was
substituted to bring it in accord with the provisions of the New York Convention. The
Foreign Awards Act has been enacted to give HC-NIC Page 48 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12
13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER effect to the New York Convention which seeks
to remedy the defects in the Geneva Convention of 1927 that hampered the speedy
settlement of disputes rough arbitration. The Foreign Awards Act therefore, intended
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42103228/ 27Oci Corporation vs Kandla Export Corporation & 2 on 8 August, 2017
to reduce the time taken in recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards. The New
York Contention seeks to achieve this objective by dispensing with the requirement
of the leave enforce the award by the Courts where the ward is made and thereby avoid the problem
of "double exequatur". It also restricts the cope of enquiry before the
Court enforcing he award by eliminating the requirement that he award should not be
contrary to the principals of the law of the country in which it sought to be relied upon.
Enlarging the field of enquiry to include public policy of the Courts whose
law governs the contract or oil he country of place of arbitration, would run counter
to the expressed intent of the legislation.
42. With regard to the provisions of the Arbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act,
937, it may be stated that S. 7(1) of the said Act, as originally enacted. read as under :
"7. Conditions For Enforcement of Foreign Awards. −(1) In order that a

or order its enforcement subject to the giving of such

43. By Indian Independence (Adaptation of Central Acts and Ordinances) Order 1948, the
words "British India" were substituted by the words "the Provinces", which words were
substituted by the words "the States" by the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950. By Part B
States (Laws) Act, 1951, the words "the States" were substituted by the word
"India". The aforesaid amendments introduced from time to time indicate that the words
"public policy" and "the law of India" are independent of each other and the words "public
policy" are not qualified by the words "of India" which follow the word "law"
because there was no separate public policy for each Province or State in India. This means
that even in the Protocol and Convention Act of 1937 the legislature had
used the words "Public Policy" only and by the said words it was intended to mean "the public
policy of India". The New York Convention has further curtailed the scope
of enquiry by excluding contravention of law of the Court in which the award is sought to be
enforced as a ground for refusing recognition and enforcement of a foreign award. The
words "law of India" have, therefore, been omitted in S. 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards
Act. It cannot, therefore, be said that by using the words "Public Policy" only S. 7(1)(b)(ii) of the.
Foreign Awards Act seeks to make a departure from the provisions contained in the
Protocol and Convention Act of 1937 and, by using the words "Public Policy". without any
qualification, Parliament intended to broaden the scope of enquiry so as to cover
public policy of other countries, i.e., the country whose law governs the contract or
the country of the place of arbitration. In the U.K., the Arbitration Act, 1975 has been
enacted to give effect to the provisions of HC-NIC Page 51 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST
2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER the New York Convention. Section 5(3) of the
said Act provides as under :
" E n f o r c e m e n t o f a C o n v e n t i o n a w a r d m a y a l s o
be refused if the award is in respect of a matter which is not capable of settlement by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42103228/ 29Oci Corporation vs Kandla Export Corporation & 2 on 8 August, 2017
arbitration, or if it would be contrary to public policy to enforce the award."
45. We are, therefore, of the view that the words "public policy" used in S. 7(l)(b)(ii) of the
Foreign Awards Act refer to the public policy of India and the recognition
and enforcement of the award of the Arbitral Tribunal cannot be questioned on the ground
that it is contrary to the public policy of the State of New York.
47. The need for applying the touchstone of public policy has been thus explained by Sir
William Holdsworth − "In fact, a body of law like the common law,
which has grown up gradually with the growth of the nation, necessarily acquires some
fixed principles, and if it is to maintain these principles it must be able, on the
ground of public policy or some other like ground, to suppress practices which, under ever
new disguises, seek to weaken or negative them". (History of English Law,
Vol. III p. 55).
48. Since the doctrine of public policy is somewhat open−textured and flexible, judges in England
have shown certain degree of reluctance to invoke it in domestic law. There are two
conflicting positions which are referred as the 'narrow view' and the 'broad view'.
According to the narrow view Courts cannot create new heads of public policy whereas
the broad view countenances judicial law making in this areas. (See
Chitty on Contracts, 26th Ed. Vol. I, para 1133, pp. 685−686). Similar is the trend of
the decision in India. In Gherulal Parakh v. Mahadeodas Maiya, 1959 Suppl (2) SCR 392:
(AIR 1959 SC 781) this Court favoured the HC-NIC Page 52 of 96 Created On
Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER narrow view when it said :
" ..........though the heads are not closed and though theoretically it may be
permissible to evolve a new head under exceptional circumstances of a
c h a n g i n g w o r l d , i t i s a d m i s s i b l e i n t h e i n t e r e s t o f
stability of society not to make any attempt to discover new heads in these
days" (p.
440) (of SCR) : (at p. 795 of AIR).
49. In later decisions this Court has, however, leaned towards the broad view. (See
Murlidhar Agarwal v. State of U.P. (1975) 1 SCR 575 at p. 584 : (AIR 1974 SC 1924 at p. 1930) :
Central Inland Water Transport Corporation v. Brojo Nath Ganguly (supra)
(1986 (2) SCR 278 at p. 373 : (AIR 1986 SC 1571 at p. 1612); Rattanchand Hira Chand v.
Askar Nawaz Jung (1991)3 SCC 67 at pp. 76−77 : (1991 AIR SCW 496 at pp. 502−03).
50. In the field of private international law, Courts refuse to apply a rule of
foreign law or recognise a foreign judgment or a foreign arbitral award if it is found that the same
is contrary to the public policy of the country in which it is sought to be invoked or
enforced. The English Courts follow the following principles:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42103228/ 30Oci Corporation vs Kandla Export Corporation & 2 on 8 August, 2017
" E x c e p t i o n a l l y , t h e E n g l i s h c o u r t w i l l n o t
e n f o r c e o r r e c o g n i s e a r i g h t c o n f e r r e d o r a
duty imposed by a foreign law where, on the facts of the particular case,
enforcement or, as the case may be, recognition, would be contrary to a
fundamental policy of English law. The Court has, therefore, refused in
certain cases to apply foreign law where to do so would in the particular
c i r c u m s t a n c e s b e c o n t r a r y t o t h e i n t e r e s t s
of the united Kingdom or contrary to justice or morality". (see Halsbury's Laws
of England, IV Ed., vol. 8, para 418).
57. In Deutsche Schachtbau−und Tiefbohrgesellschaft m.b.H. v. R.As al−
Khaimah National Oil Co. (1987) 2 All ER HC-NIC Page 53 of 96 Created On
Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER 769, decided by the Court
of Appeal. Sir John Donaldson M.R. has said :
"Consideration of public policy can never be exhaustively defined, hut they
should be approached with extreme caution. As Burrough
J. remarked in Richardson v. Mellish, (1824) 2 Bing 229 at 252, (1824−
34) All ER Rep 258 at 266. It is never argued at all but when
other points fail. It has to be shown that there is some element of illegality or that
the enforcement of the award would be clearly injurious to the public
good or, possibly, that enforcement would be wholly offensive to the
ordinary reasonable and fully informed member of the public on whose behalf
the powers of the State are exercised.
6 3 . I n v i e w o f t h e a b s e n c e o f a w o r k a b l e
definition of "international public policy"
we find it difficult to construe the expression "public policy" in Article V(2)
(b) of the New York Convention to mean international public policy. In our opinion the
said expression must be construed to mean the doctrine of public policy as
applied by the Courts in which the foreign award is sought to be enforced.
Consequently, the expression 'public policy' in Section 7(l)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards
Act means the doctrine of public policy as applied by the Courts in India. This raises
the question whether the narrower concept of public policy as applicable in the field of public
international law should be applied or the wider concept of public policy as
applicable in the field of municipal law.
65. This would imply that the defence of 'public policy which is permissible under S.
7(l)(b)(ii) should be construed narrowly. In this context, it would also be of relevance to mention
that under Article I(e) of the Geneva Convention Act of 1927, it is permissible to raise
objection to the enforcement of arbitral award on the ground HC-NIC Page 54 of 96 Created On
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42103228/ 31Oci Corporation vs Kandla Export Corporation & 2 on 8 August, 2017
Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER that the recognition or enforcement of
the award is contrary to the public policy or to the principles of the law of the country in
which it is sought to be relied upon. To the same effect is the provision in S. 7(1) of the Protocol
and Convention Act of 1937 which requires that the enforcement of the foreign award
must not be contrary to the public policy or the law of India. Since the
expression "public policy" covers the field not covered by the words "and the law of India"
which follow the said expression, contravention of law alone will not attract
the bar of public policy and something more than contravention of law is required.
66. Article V(2)(b) of the New York Convention of 1958 and Section 7 (l)(b)(ii)
of the Foreign Awards Act do not postulate refusal of recognition and enforcement of a foreign
award on the ground that it is contrary to the law of the country of enforcement and
the ground of challenge is confined to the recognition and enforcement
being contrary to the public policy of the country in which the award is set to be
enforced. There is nothing to indicate that the expression "public policy" in Article V(2)(b) of
the New York Convention and Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards
Act is not used in the same sense in which it was used in Article 1(c) of the Geneva
Convention of 1927 and Section 7(l) of the Protocol and Convention Act of 1937. This would
mean that "public policy" in Section 7(l)(b)(ii) has been used in a narrower sense and
in order to attract the bar of public policy the enforcement of the award must invoke
something more than the violation of the law of India. Since the Foreign Awards Act
is concerned with recognition and enforcement of foreign
awards which are governed by the principles of private international law, the expression "public
policy" in Section 7(l)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act must necessarily be HC-NIC Page
55 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER construed in the
sense the doctrine of public policy is applied in the field of
private international law. Applying the said criteria it must be held that the enforcement of
a foreign award would be refused on the ground that it is contrary to public policy if such
enforcement would be contrary to (i) fundamental policy of Indian
law or (ii) the interests of India or (iii) justice or morality.
99. In Indian law the principle of unjust enrichment finds recognition in the Indian
Contract Act, 1872 (Ss. 70 and 72).
100. We do not consider it necessary to go into the question whether the principle of unjust
enrichment is a part of the public policy of India since we are of the opinion that even if
it be assumed that unjust enrichment is contrary to public policy of
India, Renusagar cannot succeed because the unjust enrichment must relate to the
enforcement of the award and not to its merits in view of the limited scope of
enquiry in proceedings for the enforcement of a foreign award under the Foreign Awards Act.
The objections raised by Renusagar based on unjust enrichment do not relate to
the enforcement of the award because it is not the case of Renusagar that General Electric
has already received the amount awarded under the arbitration award and is seeking to
obtain enforcement of the award to obtain further payment and would thus be unjustly
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42103228/ 32Oci Corporation vs Kandla Export Corporation & 2 on 8 August, 2017
enriching itself. The objections about unjust enrichment raised by Renusagar
go to the merits of the award, that is, with regard to the quantum awarded by the and 7,
which is beyond the scope of the objections that can be raised u/S. 7(l)(b)
(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act. To hold otherwise would mean that in every case
where the arbitrators award an amount which is higher than the amount that should have been
awarded, the award would be open to HC-NIC Page 56 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18
IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER challenge on the ground of unjust
enrichment. Such a course is not permissible under the New York Convention and the
Foreign Awards Act. We have, however, examined the objections raised by Renusagar
relating to unjust enrichment even on merits and we are not satisfied that the amounts
awarded under items Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 7 are so excessive as to result in unjust
enrichment of General Electric."
90. Similarly, the Apex Court in the case of Shri Lal Mahal Ltd. (supra), has considered the
provisions of Section 48 of the Act in relation to foreign award and has observed thus:− "19.
Having regard to clause (b) of sub− section (2) of Section 48 of the 1996 Act, we shall
immediately examine what is the scope of enquiry before the court in which
foreign award, as defined in Section 44, is sought to be enforced. This has become
necessary as on behalf of the appellant it was vehemently contended that in light of the two
decisions of this Court in Saw Pipes1 and Phulchand Exports2, the Court can
refuse to enforce a foreign award if it is contrary to the contract between the parties
and/or is patently illegal. It was argued by Mr. Rohinton F. Nariman, learned senior counsel
for the appellant, that the expression "public policy of India" in
Section 48(2)(b) is an expression of wider import than the expression "public policy"
i n S e c t i o n 7 ( 1 ) ( b ) ( i i ) o f t h e F o r e i g n A w a r d s
(Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961. The expansive construction given by
this Court to the term "public policy of India" in Saw Pipes1 must also apply to
the use of the same term "public policy of India" in Section 48(2)(b).
20. Mr. Jayant K. Mehta, learned counsel HC-NIC Page 57 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12
13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER for the respondent, on the other hand, placed
heavy reliance upon the decision of this Court in Renusagar3 and submitted that what has
been stated by this Court while interpreting Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the
Foreign Awards Act in that case is equally applicable to Section 48(2)(b) of the 1996
Act and the expression 1 Oil and Natural Gas Corporation "public policy of India" in
Section 48(2)(b) must receive narrow meaning than Section 34. Saw Pipes1 never meant to give
wider meaning to the expression, "public policy of India" insofar as Section 48 was concerned.
According to Mr. Jayant K. Mehta, Phulchand Exports2 does not hold that all that is found
in paragraph 74 in Saw Pipes1 is applicable to Section 48(2)
(b). He argued that in any case both Saw Pipes1 and Phulchand Exports2 are decisions
by a two−Judge Bench of this Court whereas Renusagar3 is a decision of three−Judge
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42103228/ 33Oci Corporation vs Kandla Export Corporation & 2 on 8 August, 2017
Bench and if there is any inconsistency in the decisions of this Court in Saw Pipes1 and
Phulchand Exports2 on the one hand and Renusagar3 on the other, Renusagar3 must
prevail as this is a decision by the larger Bench.
21. The three decisions of this Court in Renusagar3, Saw Pipes and Phulchand Exports
need a careful and close examination by us. We shall first deal with Renusagar.
22. It is not necessary to narrate in detail the facts in Renusagar3 . Suffice it to say that
Arbitral Tribunal, GAFTA in Paris passed an award in favour of General Electric Company
(GEC) against Renusagar. GEC sought to enforce the award passed in
its favour by filing an arbitration petition under Section 5 of the Foreign Awards Act in the
Bombay High Court. Renusagar contested the proceedings for enforcement of the award filed
by GEC in the Bombay High Court on diverse grounds. Inter alia, one of the
objections raised by Renusagar was that the HC-NIC Page 58 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18
IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER enforcement of the award was contrary to the
public policy of India. The Single Judge of the Bombay High Court overruled the objections
of Renusagar. It was held that the award was enforceable and on that basis a decree in
terms of the award was drawn. Renusagar filed an intra−court appeal but that was
dismissed as not maintainable. It was from these orders that the matter reached this
Court. On behalf of the parties, multifold arguments were made. A three−Judge Bench
of this Court noticed diverse provisions, including Section 7(1)
(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act which provided that a foreign award may not be
enforced if the court dealing with the case was satisfied that the enforcement of the
award would be contrary to public policy.
23. Of the many questions framed for determination, the two questions under
consideration were; one, "Does Section 7(1)
(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act preclude enforcement of the award of the Arbitral
Tribunal, GAFTA for the reason that the said award is contrary to the public policy of
the State of New York?" and the other "what is meant by public policy in Section 7(1)(b)
(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act?". This Court held that the words "public policy" used in Section
7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act meant public policy of India. The argument that
the recognition and enforcement of the award of the Arbitral Tribunal, GAFTA can be
questioned on the ground that it is contrary to the public
policy of the State of New York was negated. A clear and fine distinction was drawn by
this Court while applying the rule of public policy between a matter governed by domestic laws
and a matter involving conflict of laws. It has been held in unambiguous terms that the
application of the doctrine of "public policy"in the field of conflict of laws is more
limited than that in the domestic law and the courts are slower to HC-NIC Page 59 of

cases involving a foreign element than when purely municipal legal issues are involved.

24. Explaining the concept of "public policy" vis−a−vis the enforcement of foreign
awards in Renusagar , this Court in paras 65 and 66 (pgs. 681− 682) of the Report stated:
65. This would imply that the defence of public policy which is
permissible under Section 7(1)(b)(ii) should be construed
narrowly. In this context, it would also be of relevance to mention that under
A r t i c l e I ( e ) o f t h e G e n e v a C o n v e n t i o n A c t o f 1 9 2 7 ,
i t i s p e r m i s s i b l e t o r a i s e o b j e c t i o n t o t h e
enforcement of arbitral award on the ground that the recognition or enforcement
o f t h e a w a r d i s c o n t r a r y t o t h e p u b l i c p o l i c y o r t o
the principles of the law of the country in which it is sought to be relied upon. To the
same effect is the provision in Section 7(1) of the Protocol & Convention Act
of 1937 which requires that the enforcement of the foreign award must not
be contrary to the public policy or the law of India. Since the
expression "public policy" covers the field not covered by the words "and the
law of India" which follow the said expression,
c o n t r a v e n t i o n o f l a w a l o n e w i l l n o t a t t r a c t
the bar of public policy and something more than contravention of law is required.
66. . . . . . . . . This would mean that "public policy" in Section 7(1)( b )( i i ) has
been used in a narrower sense and in order to attract the bar of public
policy the enforcement of the award must invoke
something more than the violation of the law of India. Since the Foreign
Awards Act is concerned with recognition and enforcement
o f f o r e i g n a w a r d s w h i c h a r e g o v e r n e d b y t h e
principles of private international law, the expression "public policy" in Section
7(1)
(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act must necessarily be construed in the
sense the HC-NIC Page 60 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017
O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER doctrine of public policy is applied in the
field of private international law. Applying the said criteria it must be held that the
e n f o r c e m e n t o f a f o r e i g n a w a r d w o u l d b e
refused on the ground that it is contrary to public policy if such enforcement
would be contrary to ( i ) fundamenta lpolicy of Indian law; or ( i i )
the interests of India; or ( ii i ) justice or morality.
25. In Saw Pipes1, the ambit and scope of the court's jurisdiction under Section 34 of the
1996 Act was under consideration. The issue was whether the court would have
jurisdiction under Section 34 to set aside an award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal,
GAFTA which was patently illegal or in contravention of the provisions of the 1996 Act or
any other substantive law governing the parties or was against the terms of the
contract. This Court considered the meaning that could be assigned to the phrase "public
policy of India" occurring in Section 34(2)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42103228/ 35Oci Corporation vs Kandla Export Corporation & 2 on 8 August, 2017
(b)(ii). Alive to the subtle distinction in the concept of 'enforcement of the award' and
'jurisdiction of the court in setting aside the award' and the decision of this Court in
Renusagar3, this Court held in Saw Pipes1 that the term "public policy of India" in Section
34 was required to be interpreted in the context of the
jurisdiction of the court where the validity of the award is challenged before it becomes
final and executable in contradistinction to the enforcement of an award after it becomes
final. Having that distinction in view, with regard to Section 34 this Court said that
the expression "public policy of India" was required to be given a wider meaning.
Accordingly, for the purposes of Section 34, this Court added a new category - patent
illegality - for setting aside the award. While adding this category for setting aside the
award on the ground of patent illegality, the Court clarified that
illegality must go to the root of the matter HC-NIC Page 61 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18
IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER and if the illegality is of trivial nature it cannot be held that
award is against public policy. Award could also be set aside
if it was so unfair and unreasonable that it shocks the conscience of the court.
26. From the discussion made by this Court in Saw Pipes in paragraph 18 of the Report, it can be
safely observed that while accepting the narrow meaning given to the
expression "public policy" in Renusagar3 in the matters of enforcement of foreign award, there
was departure from the said meaning for the purposes of the jurisdiction of the Court in
setting aside the award under Section 34.
27. In our view, what has been stated by this Court in Renusagar3 with reference to
Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act must equally apply to the ambit and
scope of Section 48(2)(b) of the 1996 Act. In Renusagar3 it has been expressly exposited that
the expression "public policy" in Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act refers to
t h e p u b l i c p o l i c y o f I n d i a . T h e e x p r e s s i o n " p u b l i c
policy" used in Section 7(1)(b)(ii) was held to mean "public policy of India". A distinction in
the rule of public policy between a matter governed by the domestic
law and a matter involving conflict of laws has been noticed in Renusagar. For all this
there is no reason why Renusagar should not apply as regards the scope of inquiry under Section
48(2)(b). Following Renusagar, we think that for the purposes of Section 48(2)
(b), the expression "public policy of India"
must be given narrow meaning and the enforcement of foreign award
would be refused on the ground that it is contrary to
public policy of India if it is covered by one of the three categories enumerated
in Renusagar3. Although the same expression 'public policy of India' is
used both in Section 34(2(b)(ii) and Section 48(2)(b) and HC-NIC Page 62 of 96
Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER
the concept of 'public policy in India' is same in nature in both the Sections but, in
o u r v i e w , i t s a p p l i c a t i o n d i f f e r s i n d e g r e e
i n s o f a r a s t h e s e t w o S e c t i o n s a r e c o n c e r n e d .
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42103228/ 36Oci Corporation vs Kandla Export Corporation & 2 on 8 August, 2017
The application of 'public policy of India' doctrine for the purposes of Section
48(2)
(b) is more limited than the application of the same expression in respect of
the domestic arbitral award.
28. We are not persuaded to accept the submission of Mr. Rohinton F. Nariman that
the expression "public policy of India" in Section 48(2)(b) is an expression of wider
import than the "public policy" in Section 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act. We have
no hesitation in holding that Renusagar3 must apply for the purposes of
Section 48(2)(b) of the 1996 Act. Insofar as the proceeding for setting aside an award under
Section 34 is concerned, the principles laid down in Saw Pipes1 would
govern the scope of such proceedings.
29. We accordingly hold that enforcement of foreign award would be refused under Section
48(2)(b) only if such enforcement would be contrary to (I) fundamental policy of Indian
law; or (2) the interests of India; or (3) justice or morality. The wider meaning given to the
expression "public policy of India"
occurring in Section 34(2)(b)(ii) in Saw Pipes1
is not applicable where objection is raised to the enforcement of the foreign
award under Section 48(2)(b).
30. It is true that in Phulchand Exports, a two−Judge Bench of this Court speaking
through one of us (R.M. Lodha, J.) accepted the submission made on behalf of the
appellant therein that the meaning given to the expression "public policy of India" in
Section 34 in Saw Pipes1 must be applied to the same expression occurring in Section
48(2)(b) of the 1996 Act. However, in what we have discussed above it must be held that HC-NIC
Page 63 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER
the statement in paragraph 16 of the Report that the expression "public policy of India
used in Section 48(2)(b) has to be given a wider meaning and the award could be set
aside, if it is patently illegal" does not lay down correct law and is overruled.
34. Mr. Rohinton F. Nariman vehemently contended that once parties had agreed that
certification by an inspecting agency would be final, it was not open to the Arbitral
Tribunal, GAFTA as well as Board of Appeal, to go behind that certificate and disregard it even if
the certificate was inaccurate (which was not the case). In this regard,
reliance was placed on two judgments of the English courts, namely, Agroexport and Alfred C.
Toepfer. He submitted that House of Lords in Gill & Duffus has affirmed the
decision in Alfred C. Toepfer. It was, thus, submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal, GAFTA and the
Board of Appeal having disregarded the finality of the certificate issued by S.G.S. India,
the awards were plainly contrary to contract and, therefore, not enforceable in India.

It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that it was not an issue in dispute and not the
buyers' case before the Arbitral Tribunal, GAFTA and/or the Board of Appeal that the
procedure adopted by SGS India was not in conformity with the contract. It was, therefore,
not open to the Board of Appeal to render a finding which went beyond the scope of the
buyers' very case.Accordingly, it was argued that the Board of Appeal dealt with the
questions not referred to it and which were never in dispute and, therefore, award
cannot be enforced because it is contrary to Section 48(1)(c) of the 1996 Act as well.
42. The challenge to the enforceability of the foreign awards passed by the Board of
Appeal is mainly laid by the sellers on the ground that the Board of Appeal has gone
beyond the terms of the contract by ignoring the certificate of quality obtained at the
HC-NIC Page 64 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER load port
from the buyers' nominated certifying agency, i.e., SGS India which was final under the
contract. The Board of Appeal, while dealing with the question
whether the SGS India certificate was issued by the contractual party and in contractual
form, noticed the clause in the contract in respect of quality and condition and it held
that SGS India was an acceptable certifying party under the contract. As regards the other
part of that clause that provided, "certificate and quality showed in the
certificate will be the result of an average samples taken jointly at port of loading by the
representatives of the sellers and the buyers", the Board of Appeal recorded its
finding as follows:
"The SGS India certificate shows that an inspection took place at the
suppliers godowns inland, and representative samples
taken. Sealed samples were inspected lotwise and the cargo meeting the
contractual specifications was allowed to be bagged for dispatch to Kandla.
Continuous supervision of loading into the vessel was also carried out at the
port. The samples drawn periodically were reduced and composite samples
were sealed; one sealed sample of each lot was handed over to the
supplier, one sealed sample of each lot was analysed by SGS and the remaining
samples were retained by SGS for a period of three months unless and until
instructions to the contrary were given.
The analysis section of the certificate states that "The above samples have
been analysed and the weighted average Pre−
shipment and Shipment results are as under:
We find that this procedure was not in conformity with the requirements
of the Contract, which required the result to be of
an average sample taken at port of loading, not the weighted average of pre−
shipment and shipment samples. Accordingly the HC-NIC Page 65 of 96 Created
On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER
certificate is uncontractual and its results are not final. In consequence the Board is
obliged to evaluate all the evidence presented, including the evidence of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42103228/ 38Oci Corporation vs Kandla Export Corporation & 2 on 8 August, 2017
t h e u n c o n t r a c t u a l S G S I n d i a c e r t i f i c a t e t o
decide whether or not the goods were of the contractual description, i.e. Durum
wheat Indian origin."
43. Thus, having held that SGS India was the contractual agency, the Board of Appeal
further held that the sellers failed to establish that the SGS India certificate was in
contractual form. Two fundamental flaws in the certification by SGS India were noted by the
Board of Appeal, one, SGS India's certification did not follow the contractual specified mode
of sampling and the other, the analysis done by SGS India was doubtful. The Board of
Appeal then sifted the documentary evidence let in by the parties and finally concluded
that wheat loaded on the vessel Haci Resit Kalkavan was soft
wheat and the sellers were in breach of the description condition of the contract.
44. It is pertinent to state that the sellers had challenged the award (no. 3782) passed by
the Board of Appeal in the High Court of Justice at London. The three decisions; (i)
Agroexport5 by Queen's Bench Division, (ii) Toepfer6 by Court of Appeal,
and (iii) Gill & Duffus7 by House of Lords, were holding the field at the time of
consideration of sellers' appeal by the High Court of Justice at London. In Agroexport , it has
been held that an award founded on evidence of analysis made other than in
accordance with contract terms cannot stand and deserves to be set aside as evidence
relied upon was inadmissible. The Court of Appeal in Toepfer has laid down that where
seller and buyer have agreed that a certificate at loading as to the quality of goods shall be
final and binding on them, the buyer will be precluded from recovering HC-NIC Page 66 of 96
Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER
damages from the seller, even if, the person giving the certificate has been negligent in making it.
Toepfer has been approved by the House of Lords in Gill & Duffus7. The High
Court of Justice at London can be assumed to have full knowledge of the legal position
exposited in Agroexport5 , Toepfer6 and Gill & Duffus7 yet it found no ground or
justification for setting aside the award (no. 3782) passed by the Board of Appeal. If
a ground supported by the decisions of that country was not good enough for setting
aside the award by the court competent to do so, a fortiori, such ground can hardly be a
good ground for refusing enforcement of the award. Accordingly, we are not persuaded to accept
the submission of Mr. Rohinton F. Nariman that Delhi High Court ought to have
refused to enforce the foreign awards as the Board of Appeal has wrongly rejected the
certificate of quality obtained from the buyers' nominated certifying agency and taken
into consideration inadmissible evidence in the nature of certificates
obtained by the buyers' for the purposes of forwarding contract.
43. Moreover, Section 48 of the 1996 Act does not give an opportunity to have a
'second look' at the foreign award in the award − enforcement stage. The scope of
inquiry under Section 48 does not permit review of the foreign award on merits.
Procedural defects (like taking into consideration inadmissible evidence or
ignoring/rejecting the evidence which may be of binding nature) in the course of foreign
arbitration do not lead necessarily to excuse an award from enforcement on the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42103228/ 39Oci Corporation vs Kandla Export Corporation & 2 on 8 August, 2017
ground of public policy.
47. While considering the enforceability of foreign awards, the court does not exercise appellate
jurisdiction over the foreign award nor does it enquire as to whether, while rendering
foreign award, some error HC-NIC Page 67 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017
O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER has been committed. Under Section 48(2)(b) the enforcement of
a foreign award can be refused only if such enforcement is found to be contrary to (1)
fundamental policy of Indian law; or (2) the interests of India; or (3) justice or morality.
The objections raised by the appellant do not fall in any of these categories and, therefore,
the foreign awards cannot be held to be contrary to public policy of India as contemplated
under Section 48(2)(b).
48. The contention of the learned senior counsel for the appellant that the Board of
Appeal dealt with the questions not referred to it and which were never in dispute and, therefore,
these awards cannot be enforced being contrary to Section 48(1)(c) is devoid of any
substance and is noted to be rejected."
91. On the aforesaid aspects, learned counsel for the petitioner has also relied upon the
following judgments of the Bombay High Court and Calcutta High Court :−
(i) Jaldhi Overseas Pvt. FZC V. Vinergy International Private Ltd. [2016 SCC Online

92. Learned counsel for the respondents has also relied upon the judgment passed in
the case of Hadley Vs. Baxendale [156 Eng. Rep. 145], and
contended that as there was back to back contract which was known to the parties, loss of profits
cannot be awarded as awarded by learned Tribunal. Firstly, the said aspect touches the

the scope of inquiry that this Court is entitled to make under Section 48 of the Act and secondly,
even if the awards in question are considered, there is finding of the fact that there was no
back to back contract and therefore, with respect to the said judgments, the same will have
no application to the facts of the case on hand. Learned counsel for the respondents

of Union of India & Ors. Vs. Sugauli Sugar Works (P) Ltd. [(1976) 93 SCC 32], and contended that,

and while awarding damages by breach of contract, the rule as to market price is intended to secure
only an indemnity to the purchaser. Even this aspect would touch the merits of the
awards in question and the facts of that case were different and distinct, whereas in
the case on hand, the awards being governed by the provisions of UK Sale of Goods Act
with respect the HC-NIC Page 69 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017

has also relied upon the judgment rendered in the case of Messrs. Trojan & Company Vs.
RM. N.N.Nagappa Chettiar [AIR 1953 SC 235] and has contended that in case of breach
of contract, measure of damages cannot be the amount of loss ultimately sustained by the
represented. In the case on hand, as stated hereinabove, the parties
had agreed for applicability of English law and the issues of quantum of damages that were
awarded by learned Arbitral Tribunal would not only touch the merits of the awards,
but the awards are passed as per the law applicable in England and therefore, the
aforesaid judgment also would not render any assistance to the case of the respondents.
94. Learned counsel for the respondents has also relied upon the judgment of Apex
Court in the case of Murlidhar Chiranjilal Vs. Harishchandra Dwarkadas & Anr. [AIR 1962
SC 366] and has contended that there is breach of Sections 73 and 74 of the Indian
Contract Act, as already held above, the case on hand is for enforcement of
foreign award and even if, there is any alleged breach of Indian Law, the same would not amount
to contravention of fundamental policy of Indian Law and hence, the said judgment would also not
HC-NIC Page 70 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER
apply to the facts of the present case.
95. The respondents have also relied upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the case
o f A s s o c i a t e B u i l d e r s ( s u p r a ) , w h e r e i n t h e A p e x
Court while considering the aspect of fundamental policy of Indian Law, interest of India, justice
and morality and patently illegal i.e contravention of substantial law of India and
contravention of arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and contravention of terms of
the contract, has observed thus:−
27. Coming to each of the heads contained in the Saw Pipes judgment, we will first
deal with the head "fundamental policy of Indian Law". It has already been seen from
the Renusagar judgment that violation of the Foreign Exchange Act and disregarding orders of
superior courts in India would be regarded as being contrary to the
fundamental policy of Indian law. To this it could be added that the binding effect of the
judgment of a superior court being disregarded would be equally violative of
the fundamental policy of Indian law.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42103228/ 41Oci Corporation vs Kandla Export Corporation & 2 on 8 August, 2017
28. In a recent judgment, ONGC Ltd. v. Western Geco International Ltd., 2014 (9) SCC
263, this Court added three other distinct and fundamental juristic principles which must
be understood as a part and parcel of the fundamental policy of Indian
law. The Court held− "35. What then would constitute the
"fundamental policy of Indian law" is the question. The decision in ONGC [ONGC Ltd.
v. Saw Pipes Ltd., (2003) 5 SCC 705] does not elaborate that aspect. Even so, the
expression must, in our opinion, include all such fundamental principles as HC-NIC Page 71 of
96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER providing a basis for
administration of justice and enforcement of law in this country. Without meaning to
exhaustively enumerate the purport of the expression "fundamental policy of Indian law",
we may refer to three distinct and fundamental juristic principles that must necessarily be
understood as a part and parcel of the fundamental policy of
Indian law. The first and foremost is the principle that in every determination whether by a
court or other authority that affects the rights of a citizen or leads to any civil
c o n s e q u e n c e s , t h e c o u r t o r a u t h o r i t y c o n c e r n e d i s b o u n d t o
adopt what is in legal parlance called a "judicial approach" in the matter. The
duty to adopt a judicial approach arises from the very nature of the power exercised by the
court or the authority does not have to be separately or additionally enjoined upon
the fora concerned. What must be remembered is that the importance of a judicial
approach in judicial and quasi−judicial determination lies in the fact that so long as
the court, tribunal or the authority exercising powers that affect
the rights or obligations of the parties before them shows fidelity to judicial approach, they
cannot act in an arbitrary, capricious or whimsical manner. Judicial approach ensures
that the authority acts bona fide and deals with the subject in a fair, reasonable and
objective manner and that its decision is not actuated by any extraneous consideration.
Judicial approach in that sense acts as a check against flaws and faults that can render the
decision of a court, tribunal or authority vulnerable to challenge.
38. Equally important and indeed fundamental to the policy of Indian law
is the principle that a court and so also HC-NIC Page 72 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST
2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER a quasijudicial authority must, while
determining the rights and obligations of parties before it, do so in accordance with the
principles of natural justice. Besides the celebrated audi alteram partem rule one of the
facets of the principles of natural justice is that the court/authority deciding the matter
must apply its mind to the attendant facts and circumstances while taking a view one way
or the other. Non−application of mind is a defect that is fatal to any
adjudication. Application of mind is best demonstrated by disclosure of the mind and
disclosure of mind is best done by recording reasons in support of the
decision which the court or authority is taking. The requirement that an adjudicatory
authority must apply its mind is, in that view, so deeply embedded in our jurisprudence that
it can be described as a fundamental policy of Indian law.
39. No less important is the principle now recognised as a salutary juristic
fundamental in administrative law that a decision which is perverse or so irrational that no
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42103228/ 42Oci Corporation vs Kandla Export Corporation & 2 on 8 August, 2017
reasonable person would have arrived at the same will not be sustained in a court of
law.
Perversity or irrationality of decisions is tested on the touchstone of Wednesbury principle
[Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corpn., (1948) 1 KB 223: (1947) 2
All ER 680 (CA)] of reasonableness. Decisions that fall short of the standards of
reasonableness are open to challenge in a court of law often in writ jurisdiction of the
superior courts but no less in statutory processes wherever the same are available.
40. It is neither necessary nor proper for us to attempt an exhaustive
enumeration of what would constitute the fundamental policy of Indian law nor is HC-NIC
Page 73 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER it possible to
place the expression in the straitjacket of a definition. What is
important in the context of the case at hand is that if on facts proved before them the
arbitrators fail to draw an inference which ought to have been drawn
or if they have drawn an inference which is on the face of it, untenable resulting in miscarriage
of justice, the adjudication even when made by an Arbitral Tribunal that enjoys
considerable latitude and play at the joints in making awards will be open to challenge and
may be cast away or modified depending upon whether the offending part is or is not
severable from the rest."
29. It is clear that the juristic principle of a "judicial approach" demands that a
decision be fair, reasonable and objective. On the obverse side, anything arbitrary and whimsical
would obviously not be a determination which would either be fair,
reasonable or objective.
Interest of India
35. The next ground on which an award may be set aside is that it is contrary to the
interest of India. Obviously, this concerns itself with India as a member of the world community
in its relations with foreign powers. As at present advised, we need not dilate on this aspect
as this ground may need to evolve on a case by case basis.
Justice
36. The third ground of public policy is, if an award is against justice or morality.
These are two different concepts in law. An award can be said to be against justice only
when it shocks the conscience of the court. An illustration of this can be given. A claimant
is content with restricting his claim, let us say to Rs. 30 lakhs in a
statement of claim before the arbitrator and HC-NIC Page 74 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18
IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER at no point does he seek to claim anything more. The arbitral
award ultimately awards him 45 lakhs without any acceptable reason or justification.
Obviously, this would shock the conscience of the court and the arbitral award would
be liable to be set aside on the ground that it is contrary to "justice".
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42103228/ 43Oci Corporation vs Kandla Export Corporation & 2 on 8 August, 2017
Morality
37. The other ground is of "morality". Just as the expression "public policy" also
occurs in Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, so does the expression "morality". Two illustrations
to the said section are interesting for they explain to us the scope of the expression "morality".
" ( j ) A , w h o i s B ' s M u k h t a r , p r o m i s e s t o
exercise his influence, as such, with B in favour of C, and C promises to pay
1,000 rupees to A. The agreement is void, because it is immoral. (k) A agrees
to let her daughter to hire to B for concubinage. The agreement is void,
because it is immoral, though the letting may not be punishable
under the Indian Penal Code (XLV of 1860)."
39. This Court has confined morality to sexual morality so far as section 23 of the Contract
Act is concerned, which in the context of an arbitral award would mean the enforcement of
an award say for specific performance of a contract involving
prostitution. "Morality" would, if it is to go beyond sexual morality necessarily cover
such agreements as are not illegal but would not be enforced given the prevailing mores of the
day. However, interference on this ground would also be only if something
shocks the court's conscience."
96. At the outset, it deserves to be noted that in the case of Associates Builders (supra), the case
b e f o r e t h e A p e x C o u r t w a s o f d o m e s t i c a w a r d a n d
the Apex Court has examined the aspect of award, which was contrary to the fundamental policy of
HC-NIC Page 75 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER
Indian Law or contrary to the Interest of India, contrary to Justice or Morality or was Patently
Illegal as provided under Section 34 of the Act, wherein the scope is wider than Section 48 of the
Act. It is not the case of the respondents that, the impugned awards are passed disregarding the
order of Superior Court in India. As per the facts revealed in the instant case, the parties
had agreed to the applicability of English law. All the parties were heard before the Arbitral
Tribunal as well as the appellate Board and in fact, the respondents carried the order
further before the Superior Courts in England and have failed. It is also not the case
of the respondents that principle of audi alteram partem has been breached. As held
hereinabove, in inquiry under Section 48 of the Act read with
Explanations 1 and 2 to Section 48 of the Act, the respondents have failed to establish that the
awards are in contravention with the fundamental policy of the Indian Law or that the same is in
conflict with basic notion of morality or justice. Explanation 2 of Section 48 plays a
vital role and is an important aspect which has to be borne in mind by this Court while examining
the foreign awards at the stage of enforcement. Thus, all the parties were heard at every stage,
more particularly the respondents cannot make any grievance that any ex parte award is

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42103228/ 44Oci Corporation vs Kandla Export Corporation & 2 on 8 August, 2017
has examined the domestic awards.

applicable i.e. UK Sale of Goods Act, even if the principle as held by the Apex Court in the case of
Associates Builder (supra), are applied, the grounds raised by the respondents do not
constitute even remotely that there is any contravention to the fundamental policy of India
or there is basic notion of morality or justice.
9 8 . H y p o t h e t i c a l e x a m p l e w h i c h w a s r e l i e d u p o n b y
learned counsel for the respondents may be good when Indian Law is to be applied and therefore,
in the instant case, it cannot be said that the impugned awards are against public policy of
India or that they are against the principles of morality and justice.
99. In the facts of this case, it cannot be said that the awards are such that it would shock
t h e c o n s c i e n c e o f t h e C o u r t a n d t h e p a r t i e s a r e b o u n d
by the agreement and the aspect whether it shocks conscience of the Court depends on the facts of
each case and when the parties had agreed for applicability of English Law and
Arbitration under the GAFTA Rules at London, the contention that the award is punitive
award cannot now be considered under Section 48 of the Act. The HC-NIC Page 77 of 96
Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER parties were aware about the
provisions of Section 51(1) and 51(3) of UK sale of Goods act which has been considered by
learned Arbitral Tribunal.
100. Learned counsel for the respondent has also relied upon the judgment of the Apex Court in the
case of Oil & natural Gas Corporation Ltd., [(2003) 5 SCC 705],
wherein the Apex Court has observed thus:− "12. Hence, the jurisdiction or the power of the
Arbitral Tribunal is prescribed under the Act and if the award is dehors the said
provisions, it would be, on the face of it, illegal. The decision of the Tribunal must be within the
bounds of its jurisdiction conferred under the Act or the contract. In exercising jurisdiction,
the Arbitral Tribunal cannot act in breach of some provision of substantive law or the
provisions of the Act.
13. The question, therefore, which requires consideration is whether the award could be
set aside, if the Arbitral Tribunal has not followed the mandatory procedure prescribed
under S. 24, 28 or 31(3), which affects the rights of the parties? Under sub−section (1)
(a) of S. 28 there is a mandate to the Arbitral Tribunal to decide the dispute in
accordance with the substantive law for the time being in force in India. Admittedly,
substantive law would include the Indian Contract Act, the Transfer of Property Act and
other such laws in force. Suppose, if the award is passed in violation of the
provisions of the Transfer of Property Act or in violation of the Indian Contract Act,
the question would be − whether such award could be set aside? Similarly, under sub−
section (3), Arbitral Tribunal is directed HC-NIC Page 78 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12
13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER to decide the dispute in accordance with the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42103228/ 45Oci Corporation vs Kandla Export Corporation & 2 on 8 August, 2017
terms of the contract and also after taking into account the usage of the trade applicable to
the transaction. If Arbitral Tribunal ignores the terms of the contract or usage of the trade
applicable to the transaction, whether the said award could be
interfered? Similarly, if the award is non− speaking one and is in violation of S.
31(3), can such award be set aside? In our view, reading S. 34 conjointly with other
provisions of the Act, it appears that the legislative intent could not be that if the
award is in contravention of the provisions of the Act, still however, it couldn't be
set aside by the Court. If it is held that such award could not be interfered, it would
be contrary to basic concept of justice. If the Arbitral Tribunal has not followed the mandatory
procedure prescribed under the Act, it would mean that it has acted beyond
its jurisdiction and thereby the award would be patently illegal which could be set aside
under S. 34.
15. Result is − if the award is contrary to the substantive provisions of law or the
provisions of the Act or against the terms of the contract, it would be patently
illegal, which could be interfered under S.
34. However, such failure of procedure should be patent affecting the rights of the parties.
16. The next clause which requires interpretation is Cl. (ii) of sub−section (2)(b) of S.
34 which inter alia provides that the Court may set aside arbitral award
if it is in conflict with the 'Public Policy of India.' The phrase 'Public Policy of
India' is not defined under the Act. Hence, the said term is required to be given
meaning in context and also considering the purpose of the section and scheme of the Act.
It has been repeatedly stated by various authorities that the expression 'public policy'
does not admit of precise HC-NIC Page 79 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017
O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER definition and may vary from generation to
generation and from time to time. Hence, the concept 'public policy' is considered to be vague,
susceptible to narrow or wider meaning depending upon the context in which
it is used. Lacking precedent the Court has to give its meaning in the light and principles
underlying the Arbitration Act, Contract Act and constitutional provisions.
18. Further, in Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. v. General Electric Co. (1994 Supp (1) SCC
644), this Court considered S. 7(1) of the Arbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act, 1937
which inter alia provided that a foreign award may not be enforced under the
said Act, if the Court dealing with the case is satisfied that the enforcement of the
award will be contrary to the public policy. After elaborate discussion, the Court
arrived at the conclusion that public policy comprehended in S. 7(1)(b)(ii) of the
Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961 is the 'Public Policy of India'
and does not cover the public policy of any other country. For giving meaning to the term
'Public Policy,' the Court observed thus :− "66. Article 5(2)(b) of the New York
Convention of 1958 and S. 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act do not postulate refusal
of recognition and enforcement of a foreign award on the ground that it is contrary to the law of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42103228/ 46Oci Corporation vs Kandla Export Corporation & 2 on 8 August, 2017
the country of enforcement and the ground of challenge is confined to the recognition and
enforcement being contrary to the public policy of the country in which the award is set to
be enforced. There is nothing to indicate that the expression
"public policy" in Art. 5(2)(b) of the New York Convention and S. 7(1)(b)(ii) of the
Foreign Awards Act is not used in the same sense in which it was used in Art. 1(c) of
the Geneva Convention of 1927 and S. 7(1) of the Protocol and Convention Act of 1937.
This would mean that "public policy" in S. HC-NIC Page 80 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18

order to attract to bar of public policy the enforcement of the award must invoke
something more than the violation of the law of India. Since the Foreign Awards Act
is concerned with recognition and enforcement of foreign
awards which are governed by the principles of private international law, the expression "public
policy" in S. 7(1)(b)(ii) of the Foreign Awards Act must necessarily be construed in the
sense the doctrine of public policy is applied in the field of
private international law. Applying the said criteria it must be held that the enforcement of
a foreign award would be refused on the ground that it is contrary to public policy
if such enforcement would be contrary to (i) fundamental policy of Indian law; or (ii) the
interests of India; or
(iii) justice or morality."
18. The Court finally held that :− "76. Keeping in view the aforesaid objects
underlying FERA and the principles governing enforcement of exchange control laws
followed in other countries, we are of the view that the provisions contained in FERA
have been enacted to safeguard the economic interests of India and any violation of the said
provisions would be contrary to the public policy of India as envisaged in S.
7(1)(b)(ii) of the Act."
20. Mr. Desai submitted that the narrow meaning given to the term 'public policy' in
Renusagar's case is in context of the fact that the question involved in the said
matter was with regard to the execution of the award which had attained finality. It
was not a case where validity of the award is challenged before a forum prescribed
under the Act. He submitted that the scheme of S. 34 which deals with setting aside the domestic
arbitral award and S. 48 which deals with enforcement of foreign award are HC-NIC Page 81
of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER
not identical. A foreign award by definition is subject to double exequatur. This is
recognised inter alia by S. 48(1) and there is no parallel provision to this clause in
S. 34. For this, he referred to Lord Mustill and Stewart C. Boyd QC's "Commercial
Arbitration" 2001 wherein (at page 90) it is stated as under :− "Mutual recognition of awards is
the glue which holds the international arbitrating community together, and this will
only be strong if the enforcing Court is willing to trust, as the convention assumes that they will
trust, the supervising authorities of the chosen venue. It follows that if, and to the extent
that the award has been struck down in the local Court it should be a matter of
theory and practice be treated when enforcement is sought as if to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/42103228/ 47Oci Corporation vs Kandla Export Corporation & 2 on 8 August, 2017
extent it did not exist."
21. He further submitted that in foreign arbitration, the award would be subject to being
set aside or suspended by the competent authority under the relevant law of that
country whereas in the domestic arbitration the only recourse is to S. 34. The aforesaid
submission of the learned senior counsel requires to be accepted. From the judgments
discussed above, it can be held that the term 'public policy of India'
is required to be interpreted in the context of the jurisdiction of the Court where the validity of
award is challenged before it becomes final and executable. The concept of enforcement of
the award after it becomes final is different and the jurisdiction of the Court at that stage
could be limited. Similar is the position with regard to the
execution of a decree. It is settled law as well as it is provided under Code of Civil
Procedure that once the decree has attained finality, in an execution proceeding, it may
be challenged only on limited grounds such as the decree being without jurisdiction or HC-NIC
Page 82 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER nullity. But in a
case where the judgment and decree is challenged before the appellate Court or the
Court exercising revisional jurisdiction, the jurisdiction of
such Court would be wider. Therefore, in a case where the validity of award is
challenged there is no necessity of giving a narrower meaning to the term 'public policy
of India.' On the contrary, wider meaning is required to be given so that the 'patently illegal award'
passed by the Arbitral Tribunal could be set aside. If narrow meaning as
contended by the learned senior counsel Mr. Dave is given, some of the provisions of the
Arbitration Act would become nugatory. Take for illustration a
case wherein there is a specific provision in the contract that for delayed payment of the amount
due and payable, no interest would be payable, still however, if the arbitrator has
passed an award granting interest, it would be against the terms of the contract and thereby
against the provision of S. 28(3) of the Act which specifically provides that "Arbitral
Tribunal shall decide in accordance with the terms of the contract." Further, where there
is a specific usage of the trade that if the payment is made beyond a period of one
month, then the party would be required to pay the said amount with interest at the rate of
15 per cent. Despite the evidence being produced on record for such usage, if the arbitrator
refuses to grant such interest on the ground of equity, such award would also be in
violation of sub−sections (2) and (3) of S. 28. Section 28(2)
specifically provides that arbitrator shall decide ex aequo et bono (according to what
is just and good) only if the parties have expressly authorised him to do so.
Similarly, if the award is patently against the statutory provisions of substantive law which is in
force in India or is passed without giving an opportunity of hearing to the parties as
provided under S. 24 or HC-NIC Page 83 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12 13:46:18 IST 2017
O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER without giving any reason in a case where
parties have not agreed that no reasons are to be recorded, it would be against the
statutory provisions. In all such cases, the award is required to be set aside on the
ground of 'patent illegality."

101. In the above cited judgment, the Apex Court has considered the aspect relating to enforcement
of domestic award as provided under Section 34 of the Act and hence, the same would not
be applicable to the case on hand.
102. Learned counsel for the respondents has also placed reliance on the following judgments :−
(i) Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Limited & Anr. Vs. Brojo Nath Ganguly

(iii) Gherulal Parakh Vs. Mahadeodas Maliya & Ors. [AIR 1959 SC 781].

Provisions of Section 48 of the Act materially corresponds to
Section 7 of the Foreign Awards Act. In the case on hand also, the parties agreed for
applicability of English Law and Arbitration HC-NIC Page 85 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12
13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER under the GAFTA Rules at London. The awards
clearly postulate that the Arbitral Tribunal and the Appellate Board have granted damages as per
t h e p r o v i s i o n s o f U K S a l e o f G o o d s A c t w h i l e
interpreting Sections 51(1) and 51 (3) of the UK Sale of Goods Act and therefore, the contention
raised by the respondents that the damages awarded by learned Tribunal is more than actual
loss and therefore, the same would amount to unjust enrichment, which in turn would
be in contravention of the fundamental policy of the
Indian Law and would mean that this Court has to go into the merits of the awards with regard to

following the ratio laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. (supra),
the same would be beyond the scope.
106. In the case on hand, it is an admitted position that the petitions relate to foreign

107. Following the ratio laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, Bombay High Court

this Court cannot adjudicate upon the merits of the case or to

section 48 of the Act does not give additional opportunity to have second look of the

award and this Court, therefore, is not empowered to look into the aspect whether the provisions of
Section 51(2) or Section 51 (3) of the UK Sale of Goods Act would apply and on that count,
it cannot be gainsaid that the same is in contravention with the fundamental policy of the
Indian Law or that it is against the morality and also that the same would shock the conscience of
this Court.

I n d i a n C o n t r a c t A c t a n d t h e r e f o r e , t h e s a m e w o u l d a m o u n t
to contravention of fundamental policy of Indian Law, deserves to be negatived. At this stage, it
would be appropriate to refer to the judgment of the Delhi High Court rendered in the case of Cruz
City Mauritius Holdings Vs. Unitech Ltd., [2017 SCC Online Del 7810], wherein it has
observed thus:− "96. It plainly follows from the above that a contravention of a provision of
law is insufficient to invoke the defence of public HC-NIC Page 88 of 96 Created On Sat Aug 12
13:46:18 IST 2017 O/IAAP/2/2017 ORDER policy when it becomes to enforcement of a foreign
award. Contravention of any provision of an enactment is not synonymous to contravention
of fundamental policy of Indian Law. The expression fundamental policy of Indian laws
refers to the principles and the legislative policy of
which Indian statutes and laws are founded. The expression "fundamental policy" connotes
the basic and substratal rationable, values and principles whcih form the bedrock of
laws in our country.
97. It is necessary to bear in mind that a foreign award may be based on foreign law, which may
be at variance with a corresponding Indian statute. And, if the expression "fundamental
policy of Indian law" is considered as a reference to a
provision of the Indian statue, as is sought to be contended on behalf of Unitech, the
basic purpose of the New York Convention to enforce foreign awards would stand frustrated.
One of the principal objective of the New York Convention is to ensure enforcement of
awards notwithstanding that the awards are not rendered in conformity to the national laws.
Thus, the objections to enforcement on the ground of public policy
must be such that offend the core values of a member state's national policy and which it
cannot be expected to compromise. The expression "fundamental policy of law" must
be interpreted in that perspective and must mean only the fundamental and substratal
legislative policy and not a provision of any enactment.

99. The explanations to section 48(2) of the Act as amended introduced by the

one; second, interest of India is no longer included in the scope of public policy; and third, it has
been expressly provided, although the same was authoritatively settled by the Supreme
Court in Renusagar Power Co. Ltd. V. Central Electric Co. That examiantion of whether the
arbitral award offends the Fundamental policy of Indian
Law, does not entail a review on merits."

arbitral board and confirmed in appeal under the GAFTA Rules and the leave to appeal was
not granted. Having accepted the applicability of English law, the awards are based on
the provisions of English law, i.e., UK Sale of Goods Act. The contention that the actual loss is less
than the damages which is awarded by the arbitrator is a matter of fact and the
merits which are considered by the arbitrator as per the English law and further by the
English courts taking into consideration the provisions of the
UK Sale of Goods Act. Therefore, the contention that the awards in question are in contravention
with section 73 of the Contract Act would not take the case of the respondents any
further. Considering the binding decision of the Apex
Court in the case of Renu Sagar (supra) and Shri Lal Mahal Ltd. (supra), the award of damages as
