CIVIL REVISION PETITION NO.4066 OF 2016
ORDER:
This revision under Article 227 of Constitution of India is filed to set aside the order dated
08.02.2016 passed in I.A.No.686 of 2014 in O.S.No.182 of 2005 by the XIV Additional Chief Judge
(Fast Track Court), City Civil Court, Hyderabad, prayed to allow I.A.No.686 of 2014 rejecting the
plaint in O.S.No.182 of 2005.
The petitioner/defendant in suit filed I.A.No.686 of 2014 under Order VII Rule 11 read with Section
151 of Code of Civil Procedure (for short, hereinafter, referred to as C.P.C.) to reject the plaint in
O.S.No.182 of 2005 pending on the file of XIV Additional Chief Judge (Fast Track Court), City Civil
Court, Hyderabad on various grounds.
The main and very first requirement of law to file a suit for Specific Performance of an agreement of
sale is that there should be a valid agreement of sale in view of A.P. State amendment by
incorporating clause (g) to Section 17 (1) of the Registration Act, 1908, with effect from 01.04.1999.
As per the said amendment all agreements of sale of immovable property worth more than Rs.100/-
compulsorily be registered. As the immovable property involved in the agreement of sale dated
06.06.2003 is worth more than Rs.100/-, the said agreement of sale is invalid for want of
registration. The said unregistered agreement of sale will not affect transfer of any immovable
property and on that ground alone the plaint is liable to be rejected. When there is no chance of
succeeding in the plaint and the same is without merits, the suit cannot be continued and the trial
Court by exercising power under Order VII Rule 11 of C.P.C. can reject the plaint and prayed for
rejection of the plaint in O.S.No.182 of 2005.
The respondent plaintiff filed counter raising several contentions. The respondent plaintiff mainly
contending that the agreement of sale is enforceable under law and the plaintiff is entitled to
maintain the suit. Under law, there is no bar to file suit for Specific Performance of a contract based
on unregistered document. Section 49 of the Registration Act, 1908 enables a party to use the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133044387/ 2R.Suresh Babu vs G.Rajalingam And 2 Others on 30 November, 2016
unregistered agreement for the purpose of specific performance of the contract. Therefore, the suit
is not barred by any law to invoke the jurisdiction under Order VII Rule 11 (d) of C.P.C. to reject the
plaint and that the suit is maintainable, prayed for dismissal of the petition.
The trial Court upon hearing both the counsel, passed the order under challenge, dated 08.02.2016
in I.A.No.686 of 2014 in O.S.No.182 of 2005 rejecting the contention of the defendant on the ground
that the agreement is admissible in law and the suit for specific performance is maintainable based
on unregistered agreement of sale and thereby the plaint cannot be rejected by exercising the power
under Order VII Rule 11 (a) or (d) of C.P.C.
Aggrieved by the order and decreetal order passed by the trial Court referred supra, the present
revision is filed almost reiterating the grounds urged before the trial Court and pointed out that the
trial Court did not exercise the jurisdiction under Order VII Rule 11 (a) or (d) of C.P.C. and when the
agreement itself is invalid, which would not affect the immovable property in view of the bar under
Section 17 (1) (g) of the Registration Act, as amended by Andhra Pradesh Act 4 of 1999 with effect
from 01.04.1999. The trial Court has not followed the proviso to Section 49 of the Registration Act,
the law laid down by the Apex Court in S.Kaladevi v. V.R.Somasundaram and others cannot be
applied to the present facts of the case since it is based on the law prevailing in Tamilnadu State and
the application of law laid down by Apex Court pertaining to Tamilnadu is an error apparent on the
face of the record. The trial Court did not consider the amendment to Section 17 (1) (g) of the
Registration Act by A.P. Act 4 of 1999 with effect from 01.04.1999 and prayed to set aside the
impugned order passed by the trial Court.
During hearing Sri J.V.Suryanarayana, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of Sri M.Mohan
Rao, learned counsel for the revision petitioner defendant No.1 mainly concentrated on validity and
enforceability of unregistered agreement of sale executed within the State of Andhra Pradesh.
Learned senior counsel further contended that in view of amendment to Section 17 (1) (g) of the
Registration Act by A.P. Act 4 of 1999 with effect from 01.04.1999, the agreement itself is not
enforceable for want of registration. When the agreement itself is not valid for want of registration,
continuation of proceedings in the suit is nothing but abuse of process of law and when there is a
direct bar for affecting transfer of immovable property, the suit cannot be decreed and thereby it
would fall within the ambit of Order VII Rule 11 (d) of C.P.C., which permits that when the suit is
barred by any other law, the plaint can be rejected by exercising jurisdiction under Order VII Rule 11
(d) of C.P.C. Similarly, the claim of the defendant would fall within the ambit of Order VII Rule 11
(a) or (d) of C.P.C., which deals with rejection of plaint, where the plaint does not disclose the cause
of action and since the cause of action mentioned in the plaint is not valid in view of non registration
of the agreement of sale dated 06.06.2003, which is the document sued upon, the plaint shall be
rejected. It is further contended that the trial Court did not consider the law in proper perspective
with reference to amendment to Section 17 (1) (g) of the Registration Act by A.P. Act 4 of 1999 with
effect from 01.04.1999 and committed serious error, which calls for interference of this Court by
exercising jurisdiction under Article 227 of Constitution of India and drawn the attention of this
Court to several judgments of Apex Court and other Courts to substantiate his contention and
prayed to allow the revision setting aside the order passed by the trial Court in I.A.No.686 of 2014 in
O.S.No.182 of 2005 and allow the same and reject the plaint.

Though notice was ordered in the revision and served on the advocate appearing for the respondents
before the trial Court, none put up appearance on behalf of the respondent plaintiff.
Considering the order passed by the trial Court and the arguments advanced by the learned counsel
for the revision petitioner, the nature of the suit document with reference to provisions of Indian
Registration Act including amendment to Section 17 (1) (g) of the Registration Act by A.P. Act 4 of
1999 with effect from 01.04.1999, the point that arises for consideration is as follows:
Whether the plaint in O.S.No.182 of 2005 is liable to be rejected on the ground that
the document sued upon i.e. agreement of sale dated 06.06.2003 in a suit for specific
performance would not affect the immovable property in view of Section 17 (1) (g) of
the Registration Act as amended by A.P. Act 4 of 1999, if so, the order passed by the
trial Court be sustained?
P O I N T:
The defendant in O.S.No.182 of 2005 filed a petition under Order VII Rule 11 (a) and
(d) of C.P.C., which deals with the rejection of plaint when the plaint does not
disclose cause of action and when the claim is barred by any other law.
The suit was filed for specific performance of agreement of sale under the provisions
of Specific Relief Act to compel the petitioner/defendant No.1 to perform his
obligation under unregistered agreement of sale. The main contention of the
petitioner is that the unregistered agreement of sale is invalid document, which
would not affect the immovable property and that apart as per A.P. amendment to
Registration Act, the agreement is a compulsorily registerable document under
Clause (g) of Section 17 (1) of Registration Act, which reads thus:
17. Documents of which registration is compulsory :-
(1) The following documents shall be registered, if the property to which they relate is
situate in a district in which, and if they have been executed on or after the date on
which, Act No.XVI of 1864, or the Indian Registration Act, 1866, or the Indian
Registration Act, 1871, or the Indian Registration Act, 1877, or this Act came or comes
into force, namely :--
(g) agreement of sale of immovable property of the value of one hundred rupees and
upwards :] Provided that the State Government may, by order published in the
Official Gazette, exempt from the operation of this sub-section any leases executed in
any district, or part of a district, the terms granted by which do not exceed five years
and the annual rents reserved by which do not exceed fifty rupees.
In the absence of registration of agreement of sale, no decree can be passed for specific performance.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133044387/ 4R.Suresh Babu vs G.Rajalingam And 2 Others on 30 November, 2016
Learned Senior Counsel would contend that the proviso to Section 49 says that unregistered
document affecting immovable property and required by this Act, or the Transfer of Property Act,
1882 to be registered may be received as evidence of a contract in a suit for specific performance
under Chapter II of the Specific Relief Act. Though it is in the nature of exception, but the language
used in the proviso that unregistered document affecting immovable property and required by this
Act indicates that when the suit is based on unregistered document affecting immovable property,
which is compulsorily registerable document, the same can be received as evidence in a suit for
specific performance. If proviso to Section 49 of Registration Act is read in conjunction with Section
17 (1) (g) of the Act, it is clear that unregistered agreement of sale of immovable property of value of
Rs.100/- or more can be received as evidence of contract. But such document is invalid according to
the contention of the learned counsel for the revision petitioner and thereby no decree can be
passed.
In support of his contention he placed reliance on the law declared by the Apex Court, this Court
and other High Courts in various judgments, which are 15 in number and the law declared therein
will be discussed at appropriate place to avoid repetition.
The main endeavour of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that when the suit is filed based on
compulsorily registerable document affecting immovable property but not registered, the suit
cannot be decreed since the transaction itself is invalid, but the trial Court did not consider this
contention in proper perspective with reference to provisions of Indian Registration Act including
amendment to Section 17 (1) (g) of the Registration Act by A.P. Act 4 of 1999 and committed an
error, hence the plaint is liable to be rejected on this ground.
Order VII Rule 11 (a) of C.P.C. conferred power on the Court to reject the plaint when it does not
disclose a cause of action.
It is settled proposition of law that the defence of the defendant cannot be looked into while
considering an application under Order VII Rule 11 of C.P.C. and the Court has to consider the entire
allegations made in the plaint and come to conclusion whether the plaint discloses any cause of
action for the suit.
Learned Counsel for the revision petitioner with regard to cause of action, drawn the attention of
this Court to a judgment of the Apex Court rendered in The Church of Christ Charitable Trust and
Educational Charitable Society, represented by its Chairman v. Ponniamman Educational Trust
represented by its Chairperson/ Managing Trustee The Apex Court in the above judgment
elaborately dealt with the power of the Court to reject the plaint under Order VII Rules 11 and 14 of
C.P.C. relying on several judgments of the Apex Court rendered in Saleem Bhai and Ors. v. State of
Maharashtra and Ors. , Raptakos Brett and Co.Ltd. v. Ganesh Property , Mayar (H.K.) Ltd. and Ors.
v. Owners and Parties, Vessel M.V.Fortune Express and Ors. and T.Arivandandam v. T.V.Satyapal
and Anr. and on the strength of the above judgments, it is concluded that the Court has to take into
consideration total allegations made in the plaint and decide whether the plaint discloses cause of
action for filing the suit.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133044387/ 5R.Suresh Babu vs G.Rajalingam And 2 Others on 30 November, 2016
In the facts of the above judgment, in a suit for specific performance, the defendant filed application
for rejection of plaint under Order VII Rule 11 of C.P.C. on the ground that the plaint does not
disclose cause of action. The single Judge of the High Court rejected the plaint insofar as the 1st
defendant is concerned and directed that the suit can be proceeded against the 2nd defendant, while
rejecting the application for interim injunction and amendment of the plaint. Thereupon the order
was challenged by the plaintiff before the Division Bench, on that the Division Bench by its order
while dismissing the appeals against the order rejecting the applications for amendment and for
interim injunction, allowed the appeal against the rejection of the plaint. Aggrieved by the same, the
1st defendant therein approached the Apex Court by filing appeal by way of Special Leave Petition,
the Apex Court concluded that when the plaint does not disclose cause of action, the same shall be
rejected.
The law declared by various High Courts is that Order VII Rule 11 of C.P.C. makes it clear that the
relevant facts which need to be looked into for deciding an application thereunder are the averments
in the plaint. The trial Court can exercise the power under Order VII Rule 11 of C.P.C. at any stage of
the suit i.e. before registering the plaint or after issuing summons to the defendant at any time
before the conclusion of the trial. For the purposes of deciding an application under Clauses (a) and
(d) of Rule 11 of Order VII Code of Civil Procedure, the averments in the plaint are germane; the
pleas taken by the defendant in the written statement would be wholly irrelevant to decide the
application filed under Order VII Rule 11 of C.P.C. But curiously in T.Arivandandam v. T.V.Satyapal
and Anr. (referred supra) the Apex Court has held as follows:
5. ...The learned Munsif must remember that if on a meaningful - for formal - reading of the plaint it
is manifestly vexatious, and meritless, in the sense of not disclosing a clear right to sue, he should
exercise his power under Order VII, Rule 11 Code of Civil Procedure taking care to see that the
ground mentioned therein is fulfilled. and if clever drafting has created the illusion of a cause of
action nip it in the bud at the first hearing by examining the party searchingly under Order X, Code
of Civil Procedure An activist Judge is the answer to irresponsible law suits. The trial Courts would
insist imperatively on examining the party at the first hearing so that bogus litigation can be shot
down at the earliest stage. The Penal Code is also resourceful enough to meet such men, (Cr.XI) and
must be triggered against them....
It is clear that if the allegations are vexatious and meritless and not disclosing a clear right or
material(s) to sue, it is the duty of the trial Judge to exercise his power under Order VII Rule 11. If
clever drafting has created the illusion of a cause of action as observed by Krishna Iyer J., in the
above referred decision, it should be nipped in the bud at the first hearing by examining the parties
under Order X of the Code.
To apply the principle laid down in T.Arivandandam v. T.V.Satyapal and Anr. (referred supra), the
Court can reject the plaint only at the time of first hearing by examining the parties under Order X
of C.P.C. but not based on application filed under Order VII Rule 11 of C.P.C. Therefore, it is
obligatory on the part of the Court to find out whether the allegations made in the plaint would give
raise to any cause of action or plaint discloses any cause of action for the suit.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133044387/ 6R.Suresh Babu vs G.Rajalingam And 2 Others on 30 November, 2016
What is cause of action, is again a question to be decided and in the same judgment the Apex Court
relied on judgment rendered in A.B.C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. and Anr. v. A.P. Agencies, Salem wherein
the word cause of action is defined as follows:
Cause of action is a bundle of facts which taken with the law applicable to them gives
the Plaintiff a right to relief against the Defendant. It must include some act done by
the Defendant since in the absence of such an act no cause of action can possibly
accrue.
In Bloom Dekor Ltd. v. Subhash Himatlal Desai and Ors. the word cause of action is
defined as follows:
Cause of action means every fact, which, if traversed, it would be necessary for the
Plaintiff to prove in order to support his right to a judgment of the Court.
Here, the plaint disclosed the acts done by the plaintiff/respondent No.1 and
defendant/revision petitioner, which form the basis for filing the suit based on
unregistered agreement of sale and refusal to execute registered the sale deed etc.
would form the basis for claiming the relief in the suit. The plaint, which is filed along
with the present revision discloses that on 06.06.2003 the plaintiff and defendant
entered into agreement of sale to purchase the schedule property, thereafter on
04.06.2005 the plaintiff approached the defendant and requested to receive the
balance sale consideration and to execute the registered sale deed in his favour, the
defendant made false statement that he would execute the sale deed within a short
time. Thereafter, the plaintiff came to know that the defendant started negotiating
with the 3rd parties to sell the suit schedule property and refused to execute the
registered sale deed in favour of the plaintiff by receiving balance sale consideration.
So, the facts pleaded in the plaint discloses the acts done by both the parties to the
suit including refusal to execute the registered sale deed by receiving balance sale
consideration in terms of unregistered agreement of sale that gave raise to cause of
action i.e. right to relief in the plaint. Therefore, the plaint disclosed cause of action,
but the contention of the revision petitioner is that the plaint shall be rejected since it
does not disclose valid or true cause of action and such contention cannot be
accepted as it is against the purport of the judgment of the Apex Court referred supra
regarding the definition of cause of action and validity or genuineness of cause of
action cannot be decided at the threshold while deciding a petition under Order VII
Rule 11 (a) of C.P.C.
Learned counsel for the revision petitioner mainly contended that the unregistered agreement of
sale would not affect the immovable property; thereby based on unregistered agreement of sale, suit
for specific performance cannot be decreed since it is invalid and ineffective transaction and placed
reliance on Kalathooru Raghavareddi v. Kalathooru Venkatareddi and Ors. and M.Venkataratnam
and Anr. v. M.Chelamayya and Anr. . In Kalathooru Raghavareddi v. Kalathooru Venkatareddi and
Ors. (referred supra) a suit for declaration of tile was filed based on unregistered document, whereas
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133044387/ 7R.Suresh Babu vs G.Rajalingam And 2 Others on 30 November, 2016
in M.Venkataratnam and Anr. v. M.Chelamayya and Anr. (referred supra) an arbitration award was
sought to be executed to claim title over the property, but the Court declined to pass such decree
since the transaction covered by unregistered agreement of sale is invalid and inoperative and that
would not create any title/ conveying title from the vendor to the vendee. But the fact situation in
the above said two judgments is different and has no application to the facts of the present case.
However, in the said two judgments, this Court held as follows:
A combined reading of S.17 and S.49, Registration Act clearly shown that an
unregistered partition deed or an award cannot affect any immovable property
comprised therein. It is not a question of admissibility of a document. The
non-registration invalidates the transaction altogether. When an invalid document is
specifically relied upon by the plaintiff and when it is found in favour of the
defendants, the fact that the execution of the invalid document was admitted cannot,
by any process of reasoning, validate the invalid document. The decisions relied upon
by the learned counsel are beside the point.
Learned counsel for the revision petitioner further drawn the attention of this Court
to another judgment of Apex Court rendered in K.B.Saha and Sons Pvt. Ltd. v.
Development Consultant Ltd. , wherein the Apex Court discussed about the effect of
unregistered lease agreement in a suit filed for declaration of title and permanent
injunction based on unregistered lease deed. The Apex Court held that the lease
agreement, being an unregistered document, could not be used to establish that the
suit premises was let out to the respondent only for the purpose of occupation of its
employee Mr.Keshab Das and the members of his family for their residential purpose
and for no other purpose.
Even from the principle laid down in the above judgment, it is clear that the
unregistered lease deed, which is required to be registered can only be used for the
purpose of proving occupation of employee and not for any other purpose since such
agreement is admissible in evidence in view of proviso to Section 49 of Registration
Act for collateral purpose. But here the fact situation is totally different, but the
principle laid down therein is only to the effect that unregistered document would not
affect immovable property and cannot be used to claim title to the property. In
K.B.Saha and Sons Pvt. Ltd. v. Development Consultant Ltd. the Apex Court laid
down the following principles:
1. A document required to be registered, if unregistered is not admissible into
evidence under Section 49 of the Registration Act.
2. Such unregistered document can however be used as an evidence of collateral
purpose as provided in the Proviso to Section 49 of the Registration Act.
3. A collateral transaction must be independent of, or divisible from, the transaction
to effect which the law required registration.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133044387/ 8R.Suresh Babu vs G.Rajalingam And 2 Others on 30 November, 2016
4. A collateral transaction must be a transaction not itself required to be effected by a
registered document, that is, a transaction creating, etc. any right, title or interest in
Immovable property of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards.
5. If a document is inadmissible in evidence for want of registration, none of its terms
can be admitted in evidence and that to use a document for the purpose of proving an
important clause would not be using it as a collateral purpose.
Similarly in K.Ramamoorthi v. C.Surendranatha Reddy this Court considered the admissibility of
unregistered document and adverted to the pleas of the defendant in paragraph No.15 that
unregistered draft lease agreement was inadmissible for want of registration under Section 49 of the
Registration Act. In view of such plea this Court placed reliance on M/s. Sms Tea Estates P. Ltd v
M/s. Chandmari Tea Co.P.Ltd. , wherein it is held as follows:
Section 49 makes it clear that a document which is compulsorily registrable, if not
registered, will not affect the immovable property comprised therein in any manner.
It will also not be received as evidence of any transaction affecting such property,
except for two limited purposes. First is as evidence of a contract in a suit for specific
performance. Second is as evidence of any collateral transaction which by itself is not
required to be effected by registered instrument. A collateral transaction is not the
transaction affecting the immovable property, but a transaction which is incidentally
connected with that transaction. The question is whether a provision for arbitration
in an unregistered document (which is compulsorily registrable) is a collateral
transaction, in respect of which such unregistered document can be received as
evidence under the proviso to section 49 of the Registration Act.
This Court also adverted to another judgment of Apex Court rendered in Bondar
Singh and others v. Nihal Singh and others , wherein the Apex Court held that
unregistered document though admitted into evidence would not affect the
immovable property. The Court finally laid down the following guidelines:
i) A document, which is compulsorily registrable, but not registered, cannot be
received as evidence of any transaction affecting such property or conferring such
power. The phrase "affecting the immovable property" needs to be understood in the
light of the provisions of Section 17 (b) of the Registration Act, which would mean
that any instrument which creates, declares, assigns, limits or extinguishes a right to
immovable property, affects the immovable property.
ii) The restriction imposed under Section 49 of the Registration Act is confined to the
use of the document to affect the immovable property and to use the document as
evidence of a transaction affecting the immovable property.
iii) If the object in putting the document in evidence does not fall within the two
purposes mentioned in (ii) supra, the document cannot be excluded from evidence
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133044387/ 9R.Suresh Babu vs G.Rajalingam And 2 Others on 30 November, 2016
altogether.
iv) A collateral transaction must be independent of or divisible from a transaction to
affect the property i.e., a transaction creating any right, title or interest in the
immovable property of the value of rupees hundred and upwards.
v) The phrase "collateral purpose" is with reference to the transaction and not to the
relief claimed in the suit.
vi) The proviso to Section 49 of the Registration Act does not speak of collateral
purpose but of collateral transaction i.e., one collateral to the transaction affecting
immovable property by reason of which registration is necessary, rather than one
collateral to the document.
vii) Whether a transaction is collateral or not needs to be decided on the nature,
purpose and recitals of the document.
Having culled out the legal propositions, the discussion on this issue will be incomplete if a few
illustrations as to what constitutes collateral transaction are not enumerated as given out in
Radhomal Alumal v K.B. Allah Baksh Khan Haji Muhammad Umar and another AIR (29) 1942 Sind
27 and other Judgments. They are as under:
a) If a lessor sues his lessee for rent on an unregistered lease which has expired at the
date of the suit, he cannot succeed for two reasons, namely, that the lease which is
registrable is unregistered and that the period of lease has expired on the date of
filing of the suit. However, such a lease deed can be relied upon by the plaintiff in a
suit for possession filed after expiry of the lease to prove the nature of the defendant's
possession.
b) An unregistered mortgage deed requiring registration may be received as evidence
to prove the money debt, provided, the mortgage deed contains a personal covenant
by the mortgagor to pay (See: Queen-Empress v Rama Tevan ('92) 15 Mad. 253, P.V.
M.Kunhu Moidu v T. Madhava Menon ('09) 32 Mad. 410 and Vani v Bani ('96) 20
Bom. 553).
c) In an unregistered agreement dealing with the right to share in certain lands and
also to a share in a cash allowance, the party is entitled to sue on the document in
respect of movable property (Hanmantapparao v Ramabai Hanmant('19) 6 : AIR
1919 Bom. 38 : 21 Bom. L.R.716).
d) An unregistered deed of gift requiring registration under Section 17 of the

reference to it the character of the possession of the person who held the land and
who claimed it, not by virtue of deed of gift but by setting up the plea of adverse

(Emphasis is brought out) Learned counsel for the revision petitioner further drawn the attention of
this Court to a judgment of Calcutta High Court rendered in Pieco Electronics and Electricals Ltd. v.
Smt.Tribeni Devi , in which a suit is filed for ejectment based on unregistered sale deed and the
Division Bench of Calcutta High Court held that the unregistered deed can at best be looked into for
ascertaining the commencement of possession, rate of rent or similar other purposes which are
collateral to the principal transaction. This should be the true import of the proviso to Section 49,
Indian Registration Act, 1908. It could never have been the intention of the Legislature that under
the first part of the section, Court should discard an unregistered document for want of registration
and at the same time under the camouflage of the proviso, Court should be permitted to look into
and rely upon all the terms of the inoperative document which do form the integral parts of the
principal transaction.
The Allahabad High Court in Surendra Kumar v. Amarjeet Singh and Ors. had an occasion to deal
with similar question in a suit for specific performance based on unregistered document with
reference to Section 17 (2) (v) and 49 (as amended in U.P. in 1976) of Registration Act and U.P.
Amendment Act 57 of 1976 held as follows:
By the amendment Act 57 of 1976, as applicable in the State of U. P., in Clause (b) of
Section 49, the words "confer any power to adopt or" has been substituted with the
words "confer any power or create any right or relationship, or" and in the proviso,
the words "as evidence of contract in a suit for specific performance under Chapter II
of the Specific Relief Act 1877, or"
has been omitted.
The result of this amendment is that, prior to 1.1.77, an unregistered document
affecting immovable property could be enforced in a suit for specific performance of a
contract, but after the amendment of Section 49 of the Registration Act w.e.f. 1.1.77,
an unregistered document could not be enforced in a suit for specific performance of
a contract.
The facts of the above judgment are distinguishable from the facts of the present
case. In the State of Andhra Pradesh Section 17 (1) (g) of Registration Act was added
by A.P. Act 4 of 1999 making agreement of sale is compulsorily registerable
document, but Section 49 of Registration Act was not appropriately amended like
Uttar Pradesh State amendment referred supra, but in section 49 of the Registration
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133044387/ 11R.Suresh Babu vs G.Rajalingam And 2 Others on 30 November, 2016
Act, in the proviso, the words, figures and letter or as evidence of part performance of
a contract for the purposes of section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of
1882 .)," are omitted by the Registration and other Related Laws (Amendment) Act,
2001 Act No.48 OF 2001 [24th September, 2001]. Thus, the proviso permitting to
receive unregistered agreement of sale as evidence of contract in a suit for specific
performance under chapter II of Specific Relief Act remained intact in the State of
Andhra Pradesh. If the similar amendment like Utter Pradesh State amendment to
Section 49 of Registration Act by way of State Amendment, unregistered agreement
of sale cannot be taken as evidence of contract in a suit for specific performance the
principle laid down by Allahabad High Court can be applied. But obviously for
different reasons, the proviso to Section 49 of Registration Act was not suitably
amended even after amending the Section 17 by A.P. Act 4 of 1999. Consequently, the
principle laid down in the above judgment of Allahabad High Court cannot be
applied.
The Apex Court in Man Kaur (Dead) by L.Rs. v. Hartar Singh Sangha while deciding
appeal against the decree in a suit for specific performance laid down law as to when
the relief of specific performance can be granted and discussed what are the
requirements to grant decree of specific performance and held that plaintiff to seek
specific performance of a contract of sale relating to immovable property, and for a
court to grant such specific performance, it is not necessary that the contract should
contain a specific provision that in the event of breach, the aggrieved party will be
entitled to specific performance. The Act makes it clear that if the legal requirements
for seeking specific enforcement of a contract are made out, specific performance
could be enforced as provided in the Act even in the absence of a specific term for
specific performance in the contract. It is evident from Section 23 of the Act that even
where the agreement of sale contains only a provision for payment of damages or
liquidated damages in case of breach and does not contain any provision for specific
performance, the party in breach cannot contend that in view of specific provision for
payment of damages, and in the absence of a provision for specific performance, the
court cannot grant specific performance. But where the provision naming an amount
to be paid in case of breach is intended to give to the party in default an option to pay
money in lieu of specific performance, then specific performance may not be
permissible.
In view of the principles laid down in the above judgment, to succeed in a suit for
specific performance, the plaintiff has to prove: (a) that a valid agreement of sale was
entered by the defendant in his favour and the terms thereof; (b) that the defendant
committed breach of the contract; and (c) that he was always ready and willing to
perform his part of the obligations in terms of the contract.
Taking advantage of the first requirement referred above, learned counsel for the
revision petitioner would contend that the basic requirement for grant of specific
performance is that there shall be valid agreement of sale between the plaintiff and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133044387/ 12R.Suresh Babu vs G.Rajalingam And 2 Others on 30 November, 2016
defendant.
Here, except non registration as required under Section 17 (1) (g) of Registration Act
as amended by A.P. Act 4 of 1999 no other contention was raised regarding invalidity
of the agreement.
By applying the principles laid down in the above judgment, the agreement of sale is not suffering
from any defect except non- registration, prima facie, but such document can be received as
evidence of contract in a suit for specific performance in view of the proviso to Section 49 of
Registration Act. Therefore, for limited purpose i.e. for filing the suit for specific performance the
agreement of sale is valid in the absence of any legal infirmity in the agreement of sale.
Consequently, the agreement as on today in a suit for specific performance can be received as
evidence of contract.
Learned counsel for the revision petitioner further drawn the attention of this Court to a judgment
of the Apex Court rendered in Satish Chand Makhan and others v. Govardhan Das Byas and others ,
wherein it is held that the proviso to Section 49 was however not applicable in the present case
inasmuch as the terms of a lease are not a "collateral purpose" within its meaning. It follows that the
unregistered draft lease agreement Ex. B-2 was inadmissible in evidence to prove the transaction of
lease. It was also ineffectual to create a valid lease for a renewed term of nine years for want of
registration as required under Section 17 (1) (d) of the Registration Act.
Division Bench of High Court of Madras in Manicka Goundan v. Elumalai Goundan held that a rule
of evidence cannot certainly enlarge or after substantive law. A rule of evidence cannot confer rights
if there are none under the general law. The only thing which follows from the proviso is that if a suit
for specific performance is maintainable, then in such a suit an unregistered document can be
received in evidence. But whether a suit for specific performance would or would not lie in given
circumstances must be decided on other considerations and on legal principles.
Bombay High Court in Association of Commerce House Block Owners Ltd. v. Vishandas Samaldas
held that the Maharashtra Ownership Flats (Amendment) Act 1963 mandates registration of
agreement and in view of Section 4 thereof registration of document is mandatory and the subject
document is unregistered one, the plaintiff is not entitled for relief of specific performance. But the
principle laid down in the above judgment cannot be applied to the present case for the simple
reason that the suit filed before the trial court is not based on any state enactment, where document
is compulsorily registerable except as required under Section 17 (1) (g) of the Registration Act as
amended by A.P.Act 4 of 1999.
In Gadiraju Sanyasi Raju v. Kandula Kamappadu and Ors. the full bench of this Court had an
occasion to deal with effect of non-registration of lease, which falls within the ambit of Section 17 (1)
(d) of the Act and this Court opined as follows:
The question however remains as to whether it is saved by the proviso to Sec. 49 of
the Indian Registration Act which is in these terms;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133044387/ 13R.Suresh Babu vs G.Rajalingam And 2 Others on 30 November, 2016
"Provided that an unregistered document affecting immovable property and required
by this Act or the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, to be registered may be received as
evidence of a contract in a suit for specific performance under Chapter II of the
Specific Relief Act, 1877, or as evidence of part performance of a contract for the
purpose of Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, or as evidence of any
collateral transaction not required to be effected by registered instrument."
This also Court also opined that Sections 12 and 27 (A) of Specific Relief Act, 1877 deals with
enforcement of contract of lease of special character subject to certain specified limitations and
when Section 27 (A) is exhaustive of all claims of specific performance based on written contracts,
the suit for specific performance cannot be decreed for non-registration.
Thus, in all the judgments it is held that when the agreement is invalid or inoperative, the suit
cannot be decreed.
Learned counsel for the revision petitioner drawn the attention of this Court to certain provisions of
Specific Relief Act and Section 27 A deals with Specific performance in case of part performance of
contract of lease, but the present suit is governed by chapter 2 of Specific Relief Act, hence Section
27 (A) has no application to the present facts of the case since it relates to enforcement of agreement
of lease.
Keeping in mind, the law declared by various Courts, based on state amendments to Registration
Act. In view of the specific contention urged before this Court, it is necessary to advert to Sections 17
& 49 of A.P. Amendment Act and examine the issue.
Section 17 of A.P. State Amendment Act reads as follows:
In section 17,--
(a) in sub-section (1),--
(i) for clause (d) the following shall be substituted, namely:-- "(d) leases of
immovable property;"
(ii) after clause (e) but before the proviso, the following clauses shall be inserted,
namely:--
"(f) any decree or order or award or a copy thereof passed by a civil court on consent
of the defendants or on circumstantial evidence but not on the basis of any
instrument which is admissible in evidence under section 35 of the Indian Stamp Act,
1899 (2 of 1899), such as registered title deed produced by the plaintiff where such
decree or order or award purports or operate to create, declare, assign, limit,
extinguish whether in present or in future any right, title or interest whether vested
or contingent of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards to or in immovable
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133044387/ 14R.Suresh Babu vs G.Rajalingam And 2 Others on 30 November, 2016
property; and
(g) agreement of sale of immovable property of the value of one hundred rupee and
upwards;"
(b) in sub-section (2),--
(i) in clause (v), for the words "any document not in itself creating", the words "any
document except an agreement of sale as mentioned in clause (g) of sub-section (1)
not in itself creating", shall be substituted,
(ii) in clause (vi), for the words "any decree or order of a court", the words "any
decree or order of a court, not being a decree or order or award falling under clause
(f) of sub-section (1)", shall be substituted,
(iii) the Explanation shall be omitted.
[vide Andhra Pradesh Act 4 of 1999 w.e.f. 1-4-1999} Similarly, Section 49 of the Registration Act
reads as under:
Section 49 - Effect of non-registration of documents required to be registered 1[or by
any provision of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of 1882)], to be registered
shall--
1[Provided that an unregistered document affecting immovable property and
required by this Act or the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of 1882), to be registered
may be received as evidence of a contract in a suit for specific performance under
Chapter II of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 (3 of 1877)2,3[***] or as evidence of any
collateral transaction not required to be effected by registered instrument.] Though,
Section 17(1)(g) is added to A.P. Amendment Act 4 of 1999 with effect from
01.04.1999, subsection (2) clause (v) was not suitably amended. Clause (v) of
subsection (2) of Section 17 spelt out that any document other than the documents
specified in sub-section (1A) except a document in clause 1 (g) (A.P. Amendment) not
itself creating, declaring, assigning, limiting or extinguishing any right, title or
interest of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards to or in immovable
property, but merely creating a right to obtain another document which will, when
executed, create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish any such right, title or interest is
exempted from application of Section 17(1).
The language used in Clause (v) of Sub-Section 2 clearly indicates that if the
agreement of sale in clause (g) of Section 17 (1) is not itself creating, declaring,
assigning, limiting or extinguishing any right, title or interest in the immovable
property of value of more than one hundred rupees, is exempted from application of
Section 17(1) of Registration Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133044387/ 15R.Suresh Babu vs G.Rajalingam And 2 Others on 30 November, 2016
Even after the Central Amendment to the Act, except clause
(g), the entire section remains as it is. Therefore, the agreement of sale whereby the
vendor agreed to execute another document to create, declare, assign, limit or
extinguish any right in the immovable property. In such a case, Section 17(1)(g) has
no application.
As per subsection (2) Clause (v) it is clear that agreement of sale which is not creating, declaring,
assigning, limiting or extinguishing any right, title or interest in immovable property of the value of
more than one hundred rupees, but agreed to create right by execution of regular registered
document, is exempted from application of Section 17(1)(g). If, the agreement itself creates an
interests in the immovable property, for instance, a general power of attorney-cum-agreement of
sale which is covered by Section 202 of Indian Contract Act is compulsorily registerable document,
since such agency is coupled with interest. But, agreement or contract of sale of immovable property
would not create any interest or extinguish the right in immovable property, is not required to be
compulsorily registerable.
Curiously, the State Amendment did not disturb Section 49 of the Registration Act by way of any
amendment and it remained undisturbed even after amending Section 17(1)(g) and Section 17(2)
clause (v). If the same is taken into consideration, the agreement of sale would fall within
explanation 2 under the proviso i.e. transfer of unregistered document affecting immovable property
and required by this Act or Transfer of Property Act to be registered, may be received as evidence of
contract in a suit for specific performance under Chapter II of Specific Relief Act. The proviso to
Section 49 was amended by Central Act 48 of 2001 with effect from 24.09.2001 omitted the
following words.
As the evidence of part performance of contract for the purpose of Section 53-A of Transfer of
Property Act, This amendment did not change the position relating to unregistered agreement of
sale which is required to be registered under Registration Act or Transfer of Property Act, as
evidence of contract in a suit for specific performance under Chapter II of Specific Relief Act. A
conjoint reading of Sections 17(1)(g), 17(2)(v), and Section 49 proviso, as amended by Central Act, it
is clear that any document which is required to be registered under the Registration Act or Transfer
of Property Act which is not registered can be received as evidence of contract in a suit filed for
specific performance under Chapter II of Specific Relief Act.
The agreement for sale is only an agreement to execute a registered sale deed in future, subject to
fulfilment of certain conditions and on execution of regular sale deed, the transfer is deemed to have
effected.
The term Sale is defined in Section 54 of Transfer of Property Act and it read as a transfer of
ownership in exchange for price paid or promised or part-paid and part-promised. It also specified
as to how sale is to be made and explained that such transfer, in the case of tangible immoveable
property of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, or in the case of a reversion or other
intangible things, can be made only by a registered instrument.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133044387/ 16R.Suresh Babu vs G.Rajalingam And 2 Others on 30 November, 2016
Effect of Contract for sale is also specified in the same section as a contract for the sale of
immoveable property is a contract that a sale of such property shall take place on terms settled
between the parties and it does not, of itself, create any interest in or charge on such property.
Therefore, such contract may be either oral or in writing. If it is in writing and falls within Section
17(1)(g) creating any interest or extinguishing right in immovable property, it is required to be
registered as per Section 17(1)(g) of the Act, but, Transfer of Property Act is silent about this.
In James R.R. Skinner v. Robert Hercules Skinner and Ors , the Privy Council held that an
agreement for sale of immovable property under a transaction affecting the property within the
meaning of Section 49 of Registration Act, unless, if carried out, it will bring about change of
ownership should be received with caution. The Privy Council held that the document ought to be
treated as being an agreement for sale rather than a sale deed and that, therefore, registration was
not necessary. The Privy Council further held that the document was a sale deed and not an
agreement mainly on the ground that the language employed is perhaps not that of a trained
draftsman, but the document clearly purports to transfer the executant's interest in the immovable
properties which he had inherited from his brother and the document in addition to creating an
interest in immovable property provided as one of the terms and therefore, an integral part of the
transfer that the vendor should, if the vendee so required, execute a registered sale deed.
But, in the same judgment, the Privy Council observed that the transfer of interest in the property is
clearly effected as seen from the language i.e. Section 49 of Registration Act.
However, in paragraph 12 of the same judgment, the Privy Council held as follows:
12. The Privy Council has held in effect that the mere offer to execute and register a
sale deed at a later date does not take away the effect of a clear recital transferring the
title and interest of the vendor to the vendee or change the character of a document
from a sale to an agreement to sell. The mere use of the word 'agreement' is not
conclusive as held by the learned Judge in Un-reported decision of this Court in
C.R.P. 199 of 1959 dated 3-11-1959. It is the cumulative effect of all the recitals and
the relevant facts which has to be taken into account to decide the question.
The provision for execution of sale deed and registration in both the documents and the provision
for obtaining the permission of the District Collector under Section 47 of the Hyderabad Tenancy
Act in one document show that contemplation of something being done in future by the vendor. The
mere existence of such provision does not necessarily mean that either the document is not a sale or
that the parties really intended to effect a real sale only by a document, duly stamped and registered.
For the provision for registration in the document, concerned in the decision of the Privy Council
has not rendered the document an agreement to sell.
Even according to the judgment of the Privy Council, if the document is creating interest or
extinguishing right in immovable property, then it is required to be registered. When the document
created interest in immovable property or extinguishes right in immovable property, mere usage of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133044387/ 17R.Suresh Babu vs G.Rajalingam And 2 Others on 30 November, 2016
the word agreement or agreeing to execute a registered document in future in terms of the
document would not alter the situation, for the reason that by executing the document, interests in
immovable property was created.
The Apex Court in Sardar Singh v. Smt. Krishna Devi and another had an occasion to deal with
effect of non-registration of award to secure right of third party in the immovable property and it
held as under:
14. It is, thus, well settled law that the unregistered award per se is not inadmissible
in evidence. It is a valid award and not a mere waste paper. It creates rights and
obligations between the parties thereto and is conclusive between the parties. It can
be set up as a defence as evidence of resolving the disputes and acceptance of it by the
parties. If it is a foundation, creating right, title and interest in present or future or
extinguishes the right, title or interest in immovable property of the value of Rs. 100
or above it is compulsorily registerable and non-
registration render it inadmissible in evidence. If it contains a mere declaration of a pre-existing
right, it is not creating a right, title and interest in present, in which even it is not a compulsorily
registerable instrument. It can be looked into as evidence of the conduct of the parties of accepting
the award, acting upon it that they have pre-existing right, title or interest in the immovable
property.
As per the principle when the document is not creating a right title or interest or extinguishing right
in immovable property, but, it declared the pre-existing factum, it is not require to be registered.
Though it is a judgment relating to pre amendment of Registration Act, still there is no change in the
position in view of Section 17(2)(v) read with Section 49 of the Registration Act.
Therefore, unregistered agreement of sale is invalid and ineffective to claim right or title in
immovable property based on such agreement but the transfer of right or interest in the immovable
property would take place only on execution of a regular registered sale deed and by mere
agreement to sell immovable property by terms settled therein by itself would not create interest or
extinguish right or title in the immovable property. Therefore, such document would fall within the
proviso to Section 49 of Registration Act after the State Amendment to Section 17 and Central
Amendment to Section 17 and 49 by A.P. Act 4/1999 and Central Act 48/2001.
Now, the question before this Court is that the suit shall not be continued as the ultimate result
would be dismissal, since the transaction covered by the agreement is invalid and ineffective. But, in
view of my perspective analysis of the amendments to Section 17 by A.P. Act and Central Act, it is
clear that the agreement of sale in the present suit dated 06.06.2003. (A document sued upon would
fall within exception under subsection (2) clause (v) and proviso to Section 49.
Learned senior counsel drawn the attention of this Court to several judgments of Apex Court, this
Court and Allahabad High Court, in all the judgments, except the judgment of Allahabad High
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133044387/ 18R.Suresh Babu vs G.Rajalingam And 2 Others on 30 November, 2016
Court, the dispute was with regard to title. Since, the transaction covered by unregistered agreement
of sale is invalid and ineffective, the Courts declined to consider the said document. In all the
judgments, except in the judgment of the Allahabad High Court, the validity of an agreement of sale
in a suit filed for specific performance with reference to various provisions to Registration Act and
Transfer of Property Act was not considered.
But, in the judgment of Allahabad High Court, Allahabad High Court held that a suit for specific
performance is not maintainable. The basis for coming to such conclusion is, the state amendment
to Section 49 of Registration Act by U.P.Act 57 of 1976 with effect from 01.01.1977 and by this Act,
the words as evidence of contract in a suit for specific performance under Chapter II of Specific
Relief Act, 1877 were omitted. But, the Central Amendment Act 48/2001 w.e.f 24.09.2001 remained
undisturbed, except deleting the words in a suit based on as part performance.
Therefore, as per the proviso to Section 49 of Registration Act, such unregistered document can be
received as evidence of contract, while concluding that the principle laid down by the Allahabad
High Court cannot be applied to the present facts of the case, particularly in State of Andhra
Pradesh.
The main endeavour of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that the Court can reject the plaint
when the document and transaction covered by agreement of sale is ineffective and invalid. But, as
discussed above, the agreement of sale is not invalid and ineffective for granting relief of specific
performance under Chapter II of Specific Relief Act, 1887 and by exercising jurisdiction under Order
VII Rule 11 CPC, the plaint in suit cannot be rejected.
An identical question came up for consideration before the Delhi High Court in Vinod Kumar & anr.
V. Ajit Singh , and the Delhi High Court held as follows:
6. On the other hand, response of the plaintiff is that for the purpose of Order VII
Rule 11 CPC, it is only the plaint and the documents which are to be considered and
not the defences. It is submitted that the agreement to sell was not compulsorily
registrable under Section 17(1A) of the Registration Act, and thus, does not come
within the mischief of proviso of Section 49 inasmuch as the provisions of Section
53A of the Transfer of Property Act were not attracted. It is the plaintiffs submission
that the agreement to sell itself does not create any right, title or interest in the
immovable property, and was thus not compulsorily registrable as per Clause (v) of
Section 17(2) of Registration Act. Based on this premise, it is the plaintiffs case that
Article 23A of the Schedule 1A as well as Sections 33 and 35 ISTA were not applicable
(Emphasis is brought out) In the written statement, the defendant raised all pleas
including validity of transaction covered by the agreement of sale of immovable
property of value of more than Rs.100/-. But the counsel for the plaintiffs contended
that, in view of law declared in Saleem Bhais case with reference to Order VII Rule 11
of the Code, the relevant facts which need to be looked into for deciding an
application thereunder are the averments in the plaint but not the defence.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133044387/ 19R.Suresh Babu vs G.Rajalingam And 2 Others on 30 November, 2016
In the facts of the above judgment, a suit was filed for specific performance based on an agreement
of sale, which formed part of payment of major part of consideration, the complaint apparently sets
out real cause of action against the defendants entitlement, the plaintiff to maintain the suit and by
following the proposition of law in Saleem Bhais case, at the stage of consideration of Order VII Rule
11 CPC, the validity or admissibility of the documents which are relied upon by the plaintiff cannot
be considered, though the Court would be entitled to consider the same and ascertain if a cause of
action was disclosed in a plaint. So far as the admissibility of the documents is concerned, the same
would be considered at appropriate stage. The same principle is laid down in Hyundai Motor India
Limited v. Opal Metal Engineering Pvt. ltd and Shri Rakesh Chandok v. Smt Harbans Kaur .
Persuaded by the law declared by the Delhi High Court, it is difficult to hold that the cause of action
employed in the plaint is not genuine and the suit of the plaintiff is barred under any other law i.e.
Registration Act.
Learned counsel for the petitioner while contending that the plaint can be rejected when the claim is
barred by Registration Act and placed reliance on the judgment of Calcutta high Court in National
Insurance Company Ltd. V. M/s Navrom Constantza and others and it is appropriate to quote
paragraph 14 of the said judgment as under:
14. The Supreme Court considered the effect of the said Rule 6 of Article III in the
case of East and West Steamship Co. v. S. K. Ramalingam . It is observed therein that
the ordinary grammatical sense of discharge from liability does not con note free
from remedy as regards liability but are more apt to mean a total extinction of the
liability following upon an extinction of the right. It is further observed that once the
liability is extinguished under this clause there is no scope of any acknowledgement
of liability thereafter. It is provided clearly in the said Rule 6 of Article 111 that the
carrier of the ship shall be discharged from all liability in respect of loss or damage
unless the suit is brought within one year after delivery of the goods or the date when
the goods should have been delivered. Therefore, in my view, the effect of this Rule is
not that the remediess are barred but the effect of it is the total extinction of the right.
In my view, if the right is extinguished then there is no cause of action of the plaintiff
against the defendants Nos. 2 and 3. Since the right has been extinguished there is
nothing to enforce in the suit.
Therefore, in my view, the plaint does not disclose any cause of action. I am, further, of the view,
that the suit as it appears from the statement contained in the plaint is barred by law within the
meaning of Rule 11 (d) of Order 7 of the C.P.C.
Similarly, in paragraphs 10 & 11 of the judgment in Sopan Sukhdevs case, the Apex Court discussed
the scope of Order VII Rule 11 of the Code and placed reliance I.T.C. Ltd v. Debts Recovery Appellate
Tribunal wherein, it was held that the basic question to be decided while dealing with an application
filed under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code is whether a real cause of action has been set out in the
plaint or something purely illusory has been stated with a view to get out of Order VII Rule 11 of the
Code.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133044387/ 20R.Suresh Babu vs G.Rajalingam And 2 Others on 30 November, 2016
Even if the principles are applied to the present facts of the case, the cause of action mentioned in
the plaint is not illusory and there is no clause in the contract i.e. agreement of sale or contract to
sell immovable property to extinguish the right to sue for specific performance under Chapter II of
Specific Relief Act. In any view of the matter, on overall consideration of entire material, more
particularly, the A.P. State Amendment and Central Amendment to Sections 17 & 49 of Registration
Act, I am of the firm view that there is no reason to reject the plaint by exercising jurisdiction under
Order VII Rule 11, since the plaint disclosed real cause of action against the plaintiff and the
agreement of sale is valid and effective for the purpose of receiving as evidence of contract in a suit
for specific performance under Chapter II of Specific Relief Act.
The contention of the revision petitioner can be accepted if the suit is filed for declaration or for any
other reliefs based on title to claim right and title over the property, based on agreement of sale. But,
in a suit for specific performance in view of Section 17 (1) (g) and 17(2)(v) and proviso to Section 49,
as amended from time to time, and the law applicable to the State of Andhra Pradesh as on the date
of execution of agreement of sale, the plaint cannot be rejected.
Rejection of plaint on the ground that the agreement of sale of immovable property of worth more
than one hundred rupees which is specifically registrable in view of A.P. Amendment Act to Section
17(1)(g), if accepted, it would have devastating effect on the rights of various purchasers of
immovable property under agreement of sale, since the judgment of this Court has got serious
repercussions both on the pending litigation for specific performance of agreement of sale or
contract of sale or the future litigation based on the agreement or contract of sale.
When similar question came up before this Court in Sardar Darshan Singh v. Sardar Ram Sing and
another , this Court held as follows:
7. A mere perusal of the said proviso shows that an exception is carved out from the
rigor of Section 49 which ordains that the document which is required to be
registered under Section 17 of the Registration Act shall not be received as evidence
of any transaction affecting such property or conferring such power unless it has been
registered. The exception applies to three categories, namely, (i) the document may
be received as evidence of a contract in a suit for specific performance; (ii) as
evidence of part performance of a contract for the purpose of Section 53-A of the
Transfer of Property Act, 1882; and (iii) as evidence of any collateral transaction not
required to be effected by registered instrument. In respect of these three categories
of transactions, notwithstanding the fact that the document which is required to be
registered has not been registered and, therefore, shall not be received as evidence,
can be received as evidence.
Similarly this Court in Attirala Chinnamma and another v. Gummadi Ravindraiah and Dadi Reddy
Sivanarayana Reddy v. Kasi Reddy Chinnamma expressed the same view.
In Javvadi Koteswara Rao v. Sonti Sambasiva Rao , this Court held as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133044387/ 21R.Suresh Babu vs G.Rajalingam And 2 Others on 30 November, 2016
Section 17 is a general provision making the agreements of sales compulsorily
registrable, but certain exceptions have been provided under the Act itself. Clause (2)
of Section 17 indicated the nature of documents that are exempted from registration.
Section 17(2) makes the position clear that any document other than the documents
specified in Sub-section 1A except an agreement of sale as mentioned in Clause (g) of
Sub- section (1) not in itself creating, declaring, assigning, limiting or extinguishing
any right, title or interest of value of Rs. 100/- and upwards to or in immovable
property, but merely creating a right to obtain another document which will, when
executed, create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish any such right, title or interest.
The learned Counsel for the respondent submits that the document by itself did not
create any right of title over the property covered by the agreement of sale, therefore,
it comes under the exception provided under Sub-clause (v) and also under the
proviso to Section 49 of the Act.
Though this Court can exercise revisional jurisdiction under Article 227, questions
regarding validity of the transactions cannot be decided, while exercising jurisdiction
under Article 227, since the scope of revision under Article 227 is limited to find out
whether the order under challenge, passed by the subordinate court or tribunal
within their jurisdictional limits and the main intention of exercising both
administrative and judicial control under Article 227 of Constitution of India is to
keep them within the bounds of their jurisdiction and not to allow them to transgress
from their jurisdiction, but not otherwise. The Court can exercise jurisdiction under
Article 227 of the Constitution of India under the following circumstances:
a) When the inferior court assumes jurisdiction erroneously in excess of power.
b) When refused to exercise jurisdiction.
c) When found an error of law apparent on the face of record.
d) Violated principles of natural justice.
e) Arbitrary or capricious exercise of authority or discretion.
f) Arriving at a finding which is perverse or based on no material.
g) A patent or flagrant error in procedure.
h) Order resulting in manifest injustice.
i) Error both on facts and law or even otherwise.
Similarly, the Court cannot exercise its discretion under Article 227 of the Constitution of India:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133044387/ 22R.Suresh Babu vs G.Rajalingam And 2 Others on 30 November, 2016
a) Where the only question involved is one of interpretation of deed;
b) On question of admission or rejection of particular piece of evidence, even though
the question may be of everyday recurrence;
c) To correct erroneous exercise of jurisdiction, as a Court of revision;
d) To set aside an intra vires finding of the fact, except where it is founded on no
material or is perverse;
e) to correct an error of law, not being an error apparent on the face of the record;
f) to interfere with the intravires exercise of discretionary power, unless it is violative
of principles of natural justice;
g) The Court shall not interfere on a merely technical ground which would not
advance substantial justice.
Article 227 deals with power of superintendence by the High Court over all Subordinate Court and
Tribunals. The power of superintendence conferred upon the High Court by Article 227 is not
confined to administrative superintendence only, but includes the power of judicial revision also
even where no appeal or revision lies to the High Court under the ordinary law, rather power under
this Article is wider than that of Article 226 in the sense that it is not subject to those technicalities
of procedure or traditional fetters which are to be found in certiorari jurisdiction and such power
can also be exercised suo motu.
It is a well settled principle that the High Court can exercise supervisory power under Article 227 of
Constitution of India, as held by the Apex Court in State (N.C.T. Of Delhi) vs Navjot Sandhu@ Afsan
Guru , that under Article 227 of Constitution of India the High Court can interfere with the
directions of the Subordinate Courts.
In view of the law laid down by the Apex Court, this Court cannot exercise its power under Article
227 of the Constitution of India though the order is wrong, since the power can be exercised only to
keep the subordinate Courts and Tribunals within its bounds. Therefore, I am unable to exercise
power under Article 227 of the Constitution of India to interfere with the findings recorded by the
trial Court since the trial Court acted within its bounds and passed the order, which is under
challenge.
In view of my foregoing discussion, I find no ground to exercise jurisdiction under Order VII Rule 11
to reject the plaint while exercising power of revision under Article 227 of Constitution of India.
Consequently, the revision petition is liable to be dismissed.
In the result, the revision is dismissed without costs. The miscellaneous petitions pending, if any,
shall also stand closed.
