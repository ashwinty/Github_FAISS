JUDGMENT
Cys, J.
1. First defendant in O.S.538 of 1985 on the file of the Court of the III Additional Senior Civil Judge,
Vijayawada is the appellant in this appeal.
2. First respondent filed the suit against the appellant and respondents 2 to 18 for recovery of
possession of Navarang Theatre at Congress Office Road, Governorpet, Vijayawada, hereinafter
called the suit property, and for damages and mesne profits, on the ground that the agreed period of
lease in respect of the suit property between her, the appellant and respondents 2 to 18 under Ex.A.1
lease deed came to an end due to efflux of time. Appellant contested the suit contending that
respondents 2 to 18 have no interest in the suit property, and that 1st respondent having initiated
proceedings under the Rent Control Act cannot invoke the jurisdiction of the Civil Court for eviction.
During the fag end of the proceedings before the trial Court, he filed two additional written
statements on 13.9.1997 and 4.2.1999 contending that first respondent (plaintiff) did not acquire
title to the suit property and that he cannot be evicted in view of Clause 22 of Ex.A.1 lease deed, and
that the suit is not maintainable in view of Ex.B.4 notice dated 20.5.1989 issued by the 1st
respondent. Defendants 2 and 4 who filed separate written statements, did not participate in the
trial of the suit.
3. 1st respondent examined one witness on her behalf as P.W.1 and marked Ex.A.1 to A.108.
Appellant examined himself only as R.W.1 and marked Exs.B.1 to B.11 on his behalf. The learned
Trial Judge, by his judgment dated 30.4.1999 passed a decree of eviction against appellant and
respondents 2 to 18 and a decree for recovery of Rs.40,250/- towards arrears of rent from 1.1.1984
to 30.11.1985, and for an amount at the rate of Rs.100/- per day from 1.12.1995 till date of delivery of
possession of the suit property to the 1st respondent against the appellant only. Respondents 2 to 18
did not prefer an appeal against the decree of eviction passed against them. So the decree of eviction
passed against them by the trial Court became final as against them. Aggrieved by the decree of
eviction and recovery of money passed against him appellant filed A.S.No.1620 of 1999, and
aggrieved by the non-awarding of mesne profits subsequent to the filing of the suit at the market
rate 1st respondent filed A.S.1917 of 1999 in this Court. The learned single Judge by a common
judgment dated 29.12.2000 disposed of both the appeals, dismissing the appeal filed by the
appellant and confirming the order of eviction passed against him by the trial Court and allowed the
appeal preferred by the 1st respondent, and granted a decree for mesne profits from 1.1.1984 till date
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52593961/ 1R.V. Bhupal Prasad vs Saleha Begum Alias Shehensha Begum And ... on 3 August, 2001
of delivery of possession to be determined on a separate application. Hence this Letters Patent
Appeal by the 1st defendant.
4. The points for consideration in this appeal are:
(1) Whether the 1st respondent is entitled to seek eviction of the appellant and (2) To
what amount of 'rent' or 'damages' is the 1st respondent entitled to?
POINT NO.1:
5. The main contention of Sri Muvva Chandra Sekhar Rao, learned counsel for the appellant is that
the trial Court, and the learned single Judge also, did not properly appreciated the contention of the
appellant that after the expiry of the stipulated period of lease of 20 years, by virtue of Clause 22 of
Ex.A.1 the appellant became a permanent lessee at the rate of Rs.300/- per month. Relying on the
observation of the Supreme Court in TAYABALI v. AHSAN and Co. 1 he contended that since 1st
respondent in para 21 of the plaint claimed "arrears of rent for the period from 1.1.1984 to
30.11.1985 at Rs.3,000/- per month" and "future profits" for the subsequent period, it should be
taken that 1st respondent knows the difference between 'rent' and 'damages' and so it is clear that
1st respondent treated the appellant as her tenant and claimed 'rent' from him from 1.1.1984 to
30.11.1985, and so it is clear that appellant is a tenant 'holding over' in respect of the suit property.
His other contention is that since 1st respondent issued the original of Ex.B.4 'notice to quit' dated
20.5.1989, subsequent to the filing of the suit, as per Section 113 of the Transfer of Property Act
(T.P. Act, for short) she waived the earlier notice to quit, issued by her under Ex.A.8 and also the
suit, by relying on MANICKLAL DEY v. KADAMBANI 2, and RAMDAYAL v. JAWALA PRASAD 3.
The contention of Sri Y.N. Lohita, learned counsel for 1st respondent, is that since the suit is filed on
the ground that the stipulated period of lease expired by efflux of time, and since 1st respondent
never agreed to continue the tenancy of the appellant and had never treated him as her tenant in
respect of the suit property after expiry of the period of lease under Ex.A.1 appellant is not a tenant
'holding over' and so the question of issuing a quit notice before filing of the suit does not arise and
contended that 1st respondent issued Ex.A.8 notice only by way of abundant caution, but not
treating the appellant and his cotenants as 'tenants holding over' and contended that in any event
Ex.A.61 judgment of this Court in W.A.No.1118 and 1183 of 1992 dated 3.9.1993 and Ex.A.63, order
of the Supreme Court in C.A.Nos.7701-7702/1995 dated 11.8.1985 (reported in R.V.BHUPAL
PRASAD v. STATE OF A.P.4, operate as res judicata. In reply, the contention of Sri Muvva Chandra
Sekhar Rao is that since the plea of res-judicata which is a mixed question of fact and law was not
raised in the trial Court 1st respondent cannot be permitted to raise that plea at this stage.
6. The first question to be answered is whether the use of the word 'rent' in clause 22 of Ex.A.1 and
also the valuation para of the plaint where 'arrears of rent at Rs.3000/- per month' was claimed by
the 1st respondent, make the appellant a 'tenant' or 'tenant holding over' of the 1st respondent in
respect of the suit property, after the expiry of lease period stipulated in Ex.A.1. A constitution of
Bench of the Supreme Court in STATE OF PUNJAB v. BRITISH INDIA CORORATION 5 while
dealing with the meaning of the word 'rent' held:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52593961/ 2R.V. Bhupal Prasad vs Saleha Begum Alias Shehensha Begum And ... on 3 August, 2001
"the word 'rent' in its wider sense means any payment made for the use of land or
buildings and thus includes the payment by a licensee in respect of the use and
occupation of any land or building. In its narrower sense it means payment made by
tenant to landlord for property demised to him"
It is thus clear that the wider meaning of the word 'rent' is 'payment for use of the land or building',
and in the narrow sense it is payment 'by a tenant to the land lord' in respect of a demised premises.
RAMAMURTY SUBUDHI v. GOPINATH 6 is a case where in a suit for ejectment of a tenant a
compromise decree was passed enabling the landlord executing the decree in case the tenant fails to
pay 'rent' for three months. Thereafter when the defendant/tenant committed default, the
plaintiff/landlord filed a petition to execute the decree. On behalf of the defendant /tenant it was
contended that there was a further lease between the parties under the compromise as the word
'rent' is used and so the defendant/tenant cannot be evicted in execution of the said compromise
decree. Repelling the said contention Supreme Court held that merely because the word 'rent' is
used in the compromise entered into during the pendency of the appeal it cannot be said that
plaintiff/landlord agreed to create a fresh lease and held that the fact he brought the suit for
ejectment showed that that his intention was to eject the judgment debtor by filing that suit. In
H.S.RIKHY v. NEW DELHI MUNICIPALITY 7 also the Supreme Court held that the mere use of the
word 'rent' in the receipts passed by a Municipality, to the occupiers of the shop constructed by it, by
itself does not establish the a relationship of 'landlord' and 'tenant' between the municipality and the
occupiers of its property, and that it would not preclude the landlord from pleading that there is no
relationship of landlord and tenant, and that the question whether there is relationship of 'landlord'
and 'tenant' or not depends on the facts of each case.
7. With the above background the averments in the plaint with regard to the claim of the 1st
respondent for recovery of 'rent' from 1.1.1984 to 30.11.1985 and future profits for the subsequent
period, has to be examined. It is well known that the case of a party should be known by reading the
pleadings as a whole but not by dissecting the pleadings. In para 14 of the plaint, 1st respondent
alleged:
"having regard to the prevailing rents to the theatre buildings, the plaintiff reserves
her right to claim rent at the prevailing market rate. However, the plaintiff for the
present limits her claim only for the rent of Rs.3,000/- p.m. as stipulated in the lease
deed for the period from 1.1.1984 to 30.11.1985 to Rs.69,000/- without prejudice to
her right to claim future mesne profits at the prevailing market rate which the
plaintiff estimates between Rs.50,000/- and Rs.1,40,000/- per month and which
amount the defendants have received"
and accordingly made the claim for recovery of Rs.40,250/-, after deducting Rs.28,750/- deposited
into court by the appellant, as rent from 1.1.1984 to 30.11.1985. If we read this para with the
valuation para i.e. para 21 of the plaint, which is strongly relied on by Sri Chandra Sekhara Rao, it is
clear that the 1st defendant did not use the word 'rent' in the sense that the appellant is her 'tenant'
in respect of the suit property, but claimed that amount only as damages as stipulated in clause 22 of
Ex.A.1.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52593961/ 3R.V. Bhupal Prasad vs Saleha Begum Alias Shehensha Begum And ... on 3 August, 2001
8. In TAYABALI case (1 supra ) the landlord issued a notice dated 13.6.1956 to the tenant claiming
possession and Rs.1,826/- as arrears of rent from 1.7.1953. After receiving the said notice the tenant
paid the amount claimed by the landlord, but did not vacate the premises and committed default in
payment of rent for the subsequent period. Therefore the landlord issued another notice dated
18.10.1957, to the defendant describing him as a 'monthly tenant' on the ground of default and also
on the ground that he requires it for his personal occupation. On 30.10.1957 the tenant tendered to
the landlord the full amount of arrears due by way of cheque, which was returned by the landlord to
the tenant. On 31.3.1958, the landlord filed a suit against the tenant for ejectment and for recovery
of arrears of rent from April, 1955 to November, 1957 and compensation for use and occupation
from December 1957 to February, 1958. In those circumstances, the Supreme Court held that the
landlord accepting the amount sent by the tenant after 1st notice, and his issuing the 2nd notice
treating him as 'monthly tenant' and claiming 'rent' from April, 1955 to November, 1957 and
'damages' from December, 1957 establishes that the landlord (plaintiff) was fully alive to the
distinction between 'rent' and 'damages for use and occupation', and held that since plaintiff treated
the second notice only as the effective notice, he is not entitled to a decree of ejectment. In this case
as stated above, in para 14 of the plaint 1st respondent limited her claim to Rs.100/- per day or
Rs.3000/- per month from 1.1.1984 to 30.11.1985, as per clause 22 of Ex.A.1 and claimed higher
amount as damages from the date of suit. Therefore, the mere use of the word 'rent' in para 21 of the
plaint, by itself does not establish that 1st respondent treated the appellant as her 'tenant' after
expiry of the stipulated period in Ex.A.1.
9. Clause 22 of Ex.A.1, which reads as under
"That the LESSEES shall quit the schedule properties on expiry of the lease period
and deliver possession of the entire demised properties to the Lessor including
furniture installed by the LESSEES and other improvements, alterations,
constructions, reconstructions and additions affected by the LESSEES if any in good
condition subject only to the charges caused by reasonable wear and tare and
irresistible force; that in default of so quitting the premises, the LESSEES shall pay
enhanced rent and damages at the rate of Rs.100/- per a day, till they are evicted by
the provisions of law by the LESSOR" .
was interpreted in Ex.A.61 by a Division Bench of this Court and the Supreme Court
in Exs.A.63. The intepretation of the above clause in Ex.A.63 would be a binding
precedent, if not RES JUDICATA because in ANJANEYULU v. RAMAIAH 8 a full
Bench of this Court held that interpretation of a material document in a prior
proceeding between the same parties even if does not operate as res judicata would
be a binding judicial precedent in a subsequent proceeding between the parties based
on that document. In Ex.A.63, at pages 20 and 21 the Supreme Court while a
reference to clauses 22 and 23 of Ex.A.1 held:
"A reading of these two covenants clearly manifests the intention of the parties that
after the expiry of the lease he is enjoined to deliver possession of the demised
premises to the landlady. After the expiry of the lease, he is treated to be in unlawful
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52593961/ 4R.V. Bhupal Prasad vs Saleha Begum Alias Shehensha Begum And ... on 3 August, 2001
possession, since he is required to pay damages for use and occupation at the rate of
Rs.100/- per day till he is evicted in due course of law. Thereby it is clear that his
possession was not treated to be juridical possession but only unlawful. He is
required to pay damages for use and occupation. Clause 23 indicates that on expiry of
the lease, the lessees should sign all necessary applications and papers and cooperate
with the lessor to obtain transfer of all the licences. That would clearly indicate the
intention, namely, that the appellant shall remain in possession only for the period of
twenty years and thereafter his possession becomes unlawful"
Appellant and 1st respondent who are parties to Ex.A.3 proceedings before the Supreme Court, are
bound by the said interpretation, and the above decision is also binding on us in view of Article 141
of the Constitution of India. In view thereof it is therefore really not necessary to consider
M.C.CHOCKALINGAM v. V.MANIKAVASAGAM9, SULOCHANAMMA V. NARAYANAN NAIR 10
relied on by Sri Y.N.Lohita, and NEELAKANTA PILLAI MATHEVAN PILLAI v,. NEELAMMA
PILLAI 11, CHARANDAS v. M/S THAKUR DASS MAST RAM 12, DEVARAPU NARASIMHA RAO v.
YERRABOTHULA PEDA VENKAIAH13, IYATTERI SHANMUGAN v. PATHIYOTTIL RADHA 14
relied on by Sri Muvva Chandra Sekhar Rao on the question of RES JUDICATA. In view thereof the
contention of Sri Muvva Chandrasekhara Rao that clause 22 of Ex.A.1 created a permanent tenancy
has no force and hence is rejected.
10. Placing strong reliance on BHAVANJI v. HIMMATLAL15 KAI KHUSHROO BEZONJEE v. BAJ
JERBAI HIRJI BHOY16 and BADRILAL v. MUNICIPAL CORPORATION17 Sri Chandrasekhara
Rao contended that a tenant at sufferance can be converted or treated by the landlord as a 'tenant
holding over' and that 1st respondent by issuing Ex.B.4 treated appellant as 'a tenant holding over'
by strongly relying on paras 8 and 9 thereof. Before deciding the merit of the said contention it is
necessary to keep in view certain facts. For Ex.A.2 notice dated 9.1.1984 issued by the 1st
respondent, appellant did not send a reply. But, respondents 4 and 5 sent a reply under Ex.A.3. With
almost identical allegations as in Ex.A.2, 1st respondent sent another notice Ex.A.4 dated 9.4.1985
to the appellant and his cotenants. In that notice also she did not claim rent, but demanded
possession, informing that on failure to vacate she would file a suit for recovery of damages for
wrongful use and occupation at the rate of Rs.15000/- per week from the date when their
contractual tenancy came to end by afflux of time on 31.12.1983, till the date of delivery. For that
notice also appellant did not send a reply. But respondents 3 to 9 sent a reply under Ex.A.5.
Subsequently, 1st respondent sent Ex.A.6 notice dated 4.5.1985 with identical allegations as in
Ex.A.5. For Ex.A.6, appellant sent Ex.A.7 telegram stating that he would send a detailed reply. But as
seen from the documentary evidence adduced, no reply was sent. Appellant as D.W.1 also did not
state that he sent a reply to Ex.A.6 notice. So it is clear that appellant did not send a reply even to
Ex.A.6 notice. Finally, before filing the suit, 1st respondent sent Ex.A.8 notice dated 9.7.1985 with
almost identical allegation as in Ex.A.6 to the appellant and the other respondents, which was
received by all of them. Long prior to the institution of the suit 1st respondent filed R.C.C.No.120 of
1977 against the appellant and his co-tenants, under the provisions of the Rent Control Act, seeking
their eviction on the ground of wilful default and some other grounds and obtained an order of
eviction. Appellant and others filed appeal in R.C.A.No.95 of 1980 against the said order of eviction.
During the pendency of the appeal 1st respondent filed two other petitions R.C.C.No.104 and 229 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52593961/ 5R.V. Bhupal Prasad vs Saleha Begum Alias Shehensha Begum And ... on 3 August, 2001
1980 seeking eviction of the appellant and his cotenants on the grounds of waste and damage to the
suit property. During pendency of R.C.A.No.95 of 1980, after Section 32(b) of the Rent Control Act
was struck down by the Supreme Court in MOTOR GENERAL TRADERS v. STATE OF A.P.18,
Government G.O.Ms.No.636 exempting the buildings fetching rent of more than one thousand
rupees per month from the provisions of the Rent Control Act. In view thereof R.C.A.No.95 of 1980
was allowed. 1st respondent who filed C.R.P.3527 of 1991 against the order in R.C.a.No.95 of 1980,
withdrew the Revision and the other two R.C.Cs. filed by her, because the suit property which was
earlier governed by the Rent Control Act, were subsequently taken out of the purview of the
provisions of the Rent Control Act by virtue of G.O.Ms.No.636 dated 29.12.1983. It is thus seen that
in her endeavour to get back possession of the suit property 1st respondent left no stone unturned.
So it is difficult to believe that 1st respondent would, after filing of the suit, again think of creating a
fresh tenancy in favour of the appellant. In KAI KUSHROO case (16 supra) which is a leading case
on the question of creation of fresh tenancy it was held that acceptance or withdrawing rents by
landlord in respect of buildings covered by Rent Control legislation would not a create new tenancy,
and it is specifically held:
"the assent of the landlord which is founded on acceptance of rent must be
acceptance of rent as such and in clear recognition of tenancy right assented by the
person who pays it"
11. In SHANTI DEVI v. AMAL KUMAR 19 the Supreme Court held that when lessor seek possession
of the demised premises from the lessee under Section 111(a) of Transfer of Property Act on the
ground that the period of lease expired by efflux of time, notice to quit under Section 106 of the
Transfer of Property Act is not necessary. In BHAVANJI v. HIMMATLAL 20 the Supreme Court
considering the status of a tenant continuing in possession of the property under his tenancy even
after the expiry of the period of lease held follows in para 9 at page 821:
"The act of holding over after the expiration of the term does not create a tenancy of
any kind. If a tenant remains in possession after the determination of the lease, the
common law rule is that he is a tenant on sufferance. As distinction should be drawn
between a tenant continuing in possession after the determination of the term with
the consent of the landlord and a tenant doing so without his consent. The former
(sic) (latter?) is a tenant at sufferance in English law and the latter (sic) (former?) a
tenant holding over or a tenant at will. In view of the concluding words of Section 116
of the Transfer of Property Act, a lessee holding over is in a better position than a
tenant at will. The assent of the landlord to the continuance of possession after the
determination of the tenancy will create a new tenancy. What the section
contemplates is that on one side there should be an offer of taking a new lease
evidenced by the lessee or sub-lessee remaining in possession of the property after
his term was over and on the other side there must be a definite consent to the
continuance of possession by the landlord expressed by acceptance of rent or
otherwise".

12. Following he above decision a Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court in M/s SUDERSHAN
TRADING CO LTD v. M/s L.D' SOUZA 21 held that no notice is required to terminate a 'tenancy at
sufferance' because there is no tenancy at all in the strict sense. Therefore, if the appellant is a
'tenant at sufferance' no notice to quit is necessary to terminate his tenancy.
13. Section 111 of the Transfer Property Act lays down the various modes or methods in which a lease
can be determined. Sections 112 and 113 of the Transfer of Property Act deal respectively with waiver
in respect of the modes of termination of lease covered by clauses (g) and (h) of Section 111 of the
said Act. There is no provision similar to Sections 112 and 113 in respect of other modes of
termination of lease covered by clauses (a) to (f) of Section 111 of the Transfer of Property Act which
impliedly means that there can be no waiver of termination of lease in respect of modes covered by
clauses (a) to (f) of Section 111 of the Transfer of Property Act. In this case the suit is filed on the
ground that period of lease expired by efflux of time, which falls under Section 111(a) of the Transfer
of Property Act. Therefore, the fact that 1st respondent filed petitions in the R.C.A. and C.R.P
seeking a direction to the appellant to deposit arrears of 'rent' is not a ground for holding that the 1st
respondent recognized the status of the appellant as a tenant in respect of the suit property, more so
because in GANGA DATT MURARKA v. KARIK CHANDRA DAS 22 it was held that acceptance of
amounts from a tenant in respect of a building covered by the Rent Control Act does not amount to
acceptance of rent from a lessee within the meaning of Sec.116 of the Transfer of Property Act.
Therefore, the fact that 1st respondent who was pursuing her remedy under the Rent Control Act,
and filed petitions seeking a direction to deposit arrears of rent under Section 11 of the Rent Control
Act, does not amount to acceptance or demanding 'rent' as contemplated in Section 116 of the T.P.
Act, to create a right in favour of the appellant to claim fresh tenancy. In fact in this case appellant,
before filing his additional written statement, did not make any assertion that he became a tenant
'holding over' because of the 1st respondent filing a petition seeking a direction to the appellant to
deposit 'rent'.
14. In the Letters Patent Appeal the applicant added a new string to the bow of attack of the
confirming judgment that because of Ex.B.4 notice issued by her 1st respondent waived the claim in
the suit, by virtue of Section 113 of the Transfer of Property Act, which reads as follows.
"A notice given under Section 111, clause (h), is waived, with the express or implied
consent of the person to whom it is given, by any act on the part of person giving it
showing an intention to treat the lease as subsisting Illustrations
(a) A, the lessor, gives B, the lessee, notice to quit the property leased. The notice
expires. B tenders, and A accepts, rent which has become due in respect of the
property since the expiration of the notice. The notice is waived.
(b) A, the lessor, gives B, the lessee, notice to quit the property leased. The notice
expires, and B remains in possession. A gives to B as lessee a second notice to quit.
The first notice is waived"
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52593961/ 7R.V. Bhupal Prasad vs Saleha Begum Alias Shehensha Begum And ... on 3 August, 2001
The said section applies to cases of termination of tenancy covered by 111(h) of the Transfer of
Property Act i.e., by issuing a notice to quit. It does not deal with applies to cases covered by clause
(a) of Section 111 of Transfer of Property Act which deals with cases of termination of tenancy by
efflux of time. For that reason alone the defence of waiver set up by the appellant is liable to be
rejected. Even otherwise there seems to be no merit in the said contention for the reasons to be
mentioned below. Illustration (a) to Section 113 of Transfer of Property Act does not apply to this
case. Appellant is relying only on illustration (b) of the said Section.
15. A Full Bench of Punjab and Haryana High Court in SHIVAJIT SINGH v. CHARANSINGH 23
after quoting the observations of Kania, J in NAVITLAL v. BABU RAO24 reading "The structure of
Section 113 is entirely different. It is expressly provided that there must be the consent of the person
to whom property was given on lease to bring about a waiver of the notice to quit. On the side of the
landlord it is provided that he must do an act showing an intention to treat the lease as subsisting. It
is, therefore, clear that under Section 113 there has to be an agreement between the two parties, and
the waiver of a notice to quit cannot be brought about by an action either of the tenant alone or of
the landlord alone Stone, C.J. has this to say on the point -
and, in my judgment, there is a fundamental difference between a waiver of a forfeiture, which is a
matter which can be done at the election of the landlord alone, and what is inaccurately referred to
as the waiver of a notice to quit which can only proceed on the basis that the landlord and the tenant
are ad idem in making a new agreement"
held as follows at page 107, para 7:
"..... a closer analysis of illustration (b) relied upon will show that it can hardly
advance the case of the appellant. The crucial thing in the sentence 'a gives to B as
Lessee a second notice to quit' appears to be the word as. It is only if the lessor gives
the second notice recognizing the lessee as such that illustration B would come into
play. It is the legal character of the person to whom the second notice is given which
is of significance. If the notice purports to be given to a trespasser, or a person in
wrongful occupation or one holding over after the due termination of the lease, then
it is not a notice as a lessee and consequently illustration B would not be attracted".
In essence for waiver contemplated by Section 113 of Transfer of Property Act to come in play there
must be 'consensus ad idem' between the parties. If second notice is issued treating the lessee only
as a 'tenant at sufferance', but not as a 'tenant holding over' question of waiver does not arise. In this
case the parties were never at 'ad idem' in respect of continuance of the lease. What 1st respondent
demanded in Ex.B.4 notice is 'damages' at Rs.100/- per day, as stipulated in Ex.A.1, but not as 'rent'
in the narrower sense of the word. As stated above the Supreme Court in Ex.A.63 held that the
amount of Rs.100/- per day stipulated in Ex.a.1 is damages, but not rent. Therefore, it is clear that
even as per Ex.B.4 also 1st respondent did not treat the appellant as her tenant and did not claim or
accept 'rent' from her.

16. In MANIKLAL DEY case (2 supra) strongly relied on by the learned counsel for appellant, the
learned Judge, on the basis that there is no proviso like second proviso to Section 112, which lays
down that acceptance of rent after institution of a suit for ejectment on the ground of forfeiture
covered by clause (g) of Section 111 of T.P. Act, would not amount to waiver, held:
"by accepting the rent, the plaintiff, in my opinion, showed the intention to treat the
lease as subsisting and acceptance of rent was waiver of the notice to quit,
notwithstanding the fact that a suit had already been filed for the purpose of ejecting
the tenant".
A close reading of the said judgment shows that the learned judges held that there was waiver in that
case because the landlord accepted 'rent' treating the lease as subsisting. At the cost of repetition it
has to be again stated that neither in Ex.B.34 nor in any other proceedings subsequent to the
institution of the suit did the 1st respondent treat the lease as subsisting. In fact in Ex.B.4, 1st
respondent after expressing her anguish and lamenting that inspite of expiry of period of lease, and
her initiating several proceedings they did not vacate the suit property demanded the appellant and
his co tenants to vacate the suit property after paying 'damages' at the rate of Rs.100/- per day as
stipulated in Ex.A.1. All the efforts of Sri Chandrasekhara Rao to persuade us to hold that 1st
respondent claiming 'rent' from the appellant amounts to recognizing his status as a 'tenant holding
over', but not as a 'tenant at sufferance' is but an exercise in futility, because in para 9 of his written
statement appellant clearly alleged "amount of Rs.100/- per day claimed by the plaintiff by way of
damages is excessive and penal".
Which shows that appellant himself is aware and fully alive to the fact Rs.100/- per day claimed by
the 1st respondent is damages, but not 'rent'.
17. Ex.B.4 is dated 20.5.1989. W.P.No.16900 of 1986, though filed earlier to Ex.B.4, was disposed of
on 15.9.1992. W.A.No.1118 of 1992 filed by the appellant and W.A.No.1183 of 1992 filed by 1st
respondent were disposed of on 3.9.1993 as seen from Ex.A.61, and the appeal filed by the appellant
before the Supreme Court was disposed of on 11.8.1995. Therefore, it is clear that though the plea
now raised that by issuing Ex.B.4 1st respondent waived her right to recover possession was very
much available to him, appellant did not take such plea either in W.P.No.16900 of 1986 or
W.A.No.1118 of 1992 or before the Supreme Court in C.A.No.7701 and 7702 of 1995, and came up
with that plea by way of filing an additional written statement after he got adverse in the writ
proceedings and appeals for the orders passed therein. The failure of the appellant to take such plea
in earlier proceedings operates as constructive res judicata as per explanation IV of Section 11 C.P.C.
Therefore appellant is precluded from raising such plea now.
18. In MANIKLAL DEY case (2 supra) relied on by Sri Chandrasekhara Rao, landlord withdrawing
the rent deposited by the defendant-tenant into court was construed as waiver. The said decision
was followed in RAMDAYAL case (3 supra). Sri Chandrasekhara Rao also placed strong reliance on
PADAM CHAND GARG v. ATAR SIGNH RIKSHAWALA25 which is a suit for ejectment and arrears
of rent decreed by the trial Court and the appeal filed by the tenant was allowed. During pendency of
the second appeal filed by him landlord sent a notice to the tenant informing him that he would
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52593961/ 9R.V. Bhupal Prasad vs Saleha Begum Alias Shehensha Begum And ... on 3 August, 2001
withdraw the second appeal if he (tenant) were to pay the rent due till then, within 30 days. In those
circumstances the learned judge held that there was waiver. The facts in that case are entirely
different from the facts of this case. The facts in YUSUFJI SULEMANJI KHATRI v.
MAHAMADBHAI AMIRBHAI MALEK26 strongly relied on by Sri Chandra Sekhar Rao are entirely
different from the facts of this case. In that case the tenancy was at Rs.35/- per month. On 18.1.1979
landlord sent at notice to the tenant demanding Rs.435/- towards arrears of rent from 1.12.1977 to
31.12.1997 and did not take any action, but sent another notice claiming Rs.910/- as arrears of rent
from 1.12.1977 to 31.1.1980. Within a period of one month of service of 2nd notice, tenant sent
Rs.945/-, i.e., Rs.35/- more than the amount demanded by the landlord in the 2nd notice which was
accepted by the landlord on 10.3.1980, i.e., within the statutory period of one month under Bombay
Rents, Hotel and Lodging (House Rates Control) Act (Act 57 of 1947). Thereafter, landlord filed a
suit for eviction on the ground that the tenant was in arrears of rent for more than six months, and
also on the ground of his reasonable and bona fide requirement for personal use. The trial Court and
Appellate Court held against the landlord on the ground of bona fide requirement, and accepted the
contention of the landlord that the tenant was in arrears of rent for six months prior to the first
notice and ordered his eviction. On revision by the tenant, the Gujarat High Court held that the
non-action on the part of the landlord for over one year after the first notice, and his serving a
second notice treating him as a tenant as such, and not as a trespasser or the like and demanding
arrears of rent and accepting the rents sent by the tenant by money order, would amount to waiver
of the 1st notice and allowed the revision and dismissed the suit filed by the landlord.
19. The Calcutta High Court in MAHADEVO PRASAD v. SULEKHA SARKAR 27 did not follow
MANIKLAL DEY case (2 supra) and observed as follows (at page 406):
"The decision of Buckland J in AIR 1926 CAL 763; where he inferred waiver of the
notice to quit from the landlord's withdrawal of deposit from the Rent Controller did
not take into consideration the various aspects from which this question of waiver
ought to be approached and considered and its criticism in the case of - 'Navnitlal
Chunilal V. Baburao, AIR 1945 Bom 132 at p.134 (J) of the Report is not altogether
unjustified. Lord Mansfield's observation quoted at pages 134 to 135 of this latter
report from the old English case of - 'Doe V. Batten' (1775) 1 Cowp 245 (k), deserves
careful consideration and in my opinion, the view of Sarkar J in - and of the Bombay
High Court kin the case of - 'Baldeodas V. G.P.Sonavalla' AIR 1948 Bom 385 (L) is, on
the whole, correct"
20. In SALEH BROS. V. K.RAJENDRAN28 a learned judge of the Madras High Court after
reviewing the entire case law dissented from MANIKLAL case(2 supra), and held that acceptance of
rent after a suit for ejectment is filed cannot regarded as waiver, because after the matter came to
Court the election became irrevocable. The said decision of Madras High Court was followed by this
High Court in P.LAKSHMANCHANDJI v. V.V.S.R.MURTY 29. Sri Chandrasekhar Rao tried to
distinguish the said decision on the ground that rents after filing of the suit in that case were
received 'without prejudice' and that that factor weighed with the learned Judge for holding that
there was no waiver. It is no doubt true that in that case receipts for rents were issued with a noting
'without prejudice'. But we are unable to agree with the contention of Sri Chandra Sekhar Rao that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52593961/ 10R.V. Bhupal Prasad vs Saleha Begum Alias Shehensha Begum And ... on 3 August, 2001
the learned Judge had only on the basis that receipts were issued with a noting 'without prejudice'
held that there was no 'waiver'. In that case the learned Judge, after referring to the case law, held
that no question of waiver arises if the landlord received 'rent' from the tenant after filing a suit for
ejectment. The said decision was followed by another learned Judge of this Court in
K.LAKSHAMANA RAO v. K.V. MANIKYAL RAO 30 who held that acceptance of rent from the
tenant by landlord after institution of suit for ejectment against his tenant does not amount to
waiver. A Division Bench of Punjab High Court in BASHESHAR NORTH v. DELHI
IMPROVEMENT TRUST31 , the Allahabad High Court in MOTILAL v. BASANTLAL32 , the Jammu
and Kashmir High Court in RAMLAL v. SARDIR LAL 33, the Rajastan High Court in KOTIBAI v.
KASTURI BAI34, the Delhi High Court in B.P.N.SHRIVASTAV v. SMT.POORI BAI 35, held that the
landlord either receiving rent or issuing another notice, after filing a suit for ejectment by
themselves do not constitute waiver.
21. In our considered opinion in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in RAMAMURTHY
SUBHUDI case (7 supra) holding that intention to create a fresh tenancy by using the word 'rent' in
a compromise decree cannot be inferred by mere use of the word 'rent' in a compromise decree, the
decision in MANICKLAL DEY case (2 supra) must be held to be impliedly overruled, because if we
apply the anology adopted by the Supreme Court, the mere act of withdrawal of rent deposited by
the tenant into Court, the landlord cannot be imputed with an intention to create a new tenancy.
22. In respect of the two additional written statements filed by the appellant on 13.10.1997 and
4.2.1999, the docket of the trial Court shows the appellant filing a petition to receive his additional
written statement dated 4.2.1999 and the Court granting permission therefor in I.A.No.67 of 1999,
but does not disclose any permission being sought for or granted for filing the additional statement
dated 13.10.1997. Be that as it may, from the averments in additional written statement dated
13.10.1997, more particularly those in paras 3 and 6 thereof, it is seen that that the appellant
disputes the title of the 1st respondent to the suit property. Since denial of the title is made during
the trial of the suit, by filing an additional written statement the said denial cannot be said to be
bona fide. The Supreme Court in M.SUBBARAO P.V.K.KRISHNA 36 held that denial of title during
the course of eviction proceedings constitutes a good ground for eviction , provided the denial is not
bona fide and that such denial need not be anterior to the institution of the proceedings. Therefore,
for the reason that the appellant denied the title of the 1st respondent to the suit property, the
appellant is liable to be evicted from the suit property.
23. From the pleas taken in the additional written statement filed by the appellant it is seen that his
contention is that the suit without seeking partition is not maintainable and that 1st respondent is
not the owner of Navarang Theatre, overlooking clause 9 of Ex.A.1 which reads:
"that the lessees are empowered to change the name of the theatre from its present
name "SHHENSHA MAHAL" as they please and run the business choosing any other
suitable name and the LESSOR shall have no objections for any such change"
And the admissions in para 5 of his written statement where he alleged that by the date of Ex.A.1,
'Navarang Theatre' was called Shehansha Mahal, and in para 4 he alleged that he became the sole
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52593961/ 11R.V. Bhupal Prasad vs Saleha Begum Alias Shehensha Begum And ... on 3 August, 2001
lessee of Navarang theatre, as named by the Lessees, and has been in exclusive possession and
enjoyment of the said Navarang theatre. In para 10 of his written statement appellant alleged that
the lessees have improved the cinema hall i.e., 'suit Navarang theatre' at a 'heavy cost' and made it
'one of the best theaters in Vijayawada' and that subsequently they purchased some site with their
own fund and "annexed to the demised property and made some constructions in it for the
beneficial enjoyment of the suit theatre and that the constructions made by the lessees are beneficial
to the owners of the theatre or persons incharge of the theatre".
Thus there is a clear admission in the written statement of the appellant that 'Shehansha Mahal' and
'Navarang Theatre' are one and the same, and that the purchase of adjacent property, and the new
construction made became an integral part of the demised property, and are made for the
"beneficial enjoyment" of the theatre and are 'beneficial to the owner'. But during trial he took a new
plea, and gave evidence as D.W.1 that 1st respondent did not lease out Navarang theatre to him, and
that Sheshansha Mahal alone was leased out under Ex.A.1, and that Shehansha Mahal is not in
existence, and only Navarang theatre is in existence, and that it is not possible to deliver possession
of the schedule property without dismantling the existing structures, and that canteen, varandah
and part of air condition plant and A/C overhead tank have to be demolished for demarcating the
suit schedule property and that there is no agreement to hand over the newly constructed theater to
the 1st respondent after 20 years, and as he did not agree to hand over the property after making
improvements, he is not liable to handover the property with the constructions made by him.
24. The above evidence of appellant as D.W.1 is contrary to clause 22 of Ex.A.1 which was extracted
above. Under the said clause the lessees undertook to deliver possession of the premises to the
lessor 'including the furniture installed by the lessees and other "improvements, alterations,
constructions, reconstructions and additions effected by the lessees, if any, in good condition".
Assession made to the demised premises as per the contract as per Section 108(d) of Transfer of
Property Act would from part of the demised premises and as per section 110 (q) of the Transfer of
Property Act on determination of the lease the lessee is bound to put the lessor in to possession of
the said property. Therefore additions made to the demised property, which under clause 22 of
Ex.A.1 are agreed to be treated as a part and parcel of the demised premises, and also as per Section
108(d) of the Transfer of Property Act became part of the demised premises.
25. In respect of the plea that some property adjacent to the premises let out under Ex.A.1, was
purchased and improvements were made therein, no evidence was adduced by the appellant. In fact
the appellant, as D.W.1, did not even state that he made any purchases or additions to the property
covered by Ex.A.1, and did not produce any document to show that some property adjacent to the
property covered by Ex.A.1 was in tact purchased by him and his cotenants. As stated above in any
event since the property which is adjacent to the demised premises said to have been purchased by
the appellant or his cotenant was made a part and parcel of the demised premises for its beneficial
enjoyment thereof and became an inseparable part of 'Navarang Theatre' formerly known as
'SHESHANSHA MAHAL", as per clause 22 of Ex.A.1 1st respondent is entitled to recover the entire
Navarang Theatre premises with all its annexures from the appellant, and the appellant can not
raise any objection there for.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52593961/ 12R.V. Bhupal Prasad vs Saleha Begum Alias Shehensha Begum And ... on 3 August, 2001
26. For the above reasons, we hold that no notice to quit was necessary for the 1st respondent before
filing the suit for ejectment of appellant and the contention of the appellant that by virtue of Ex.B.4
there was a waiver of the earlier notice to quit, has no merit and so 1st respondent is entitled to
recover possession of the entire Navarang Theatre premises from the appellant and also
respondents 2 to 18. The point is answered accordingly.
27. Point No.2:
The Supreme Court in Ex.A.63 held that the possession of the appellant after
31.12.1983 is unlawful. In a suit for recovery of possession of immovable property and
rent or mesne profits, the court under Rule 12 of Order 20 C.P.C. is empowered to
pass a decree for rents which have accrued on the property during the period prior to
the institution of the suit, for mesne profits or directing an enquiry as to such mesne
profits, until delivery possession to the decree holder. Mesne profits is defined in
Section 2(12) C.P.C. as:
"profits which the person wrongful possession of such property actually received or
might with ordinary diligence have received there from, together with interest on
such profits, but shall not include profits due to improvements made by the person in
wrongful possession"
A Division Bench of Madras High Court in THE UNION OF INDIA v. ANDHRA BANK LTD 37 held
that a tenant at sufferance cannot unjustly enrich himself by claiming that he will pay only the
quondam rent and not reasonable rate of damages for use and occupation of the premises, and that
if inspite of warning by the landlord he continuously remains in possession of the premises, the
landlord secures a right to get a reasonable compensation from the tenant for such occupation, but
in no circumstances, can that amount exceed the enhanced rate demanded by the landlord. In the
plaint, 1st respondent claimed damages at the rate of Rs.100/- per day from 1.1.1984 to 30.11.1985
ie., Rs.3000/- per month, and future mesne profits at the prevailing market rate, till delivery of
possession, by directing an enquiry into the same. The trial Court passed a decree for mesne profits
at that rate of Rs.3000/- per month from 1.1.1984 till the date of delivery of possession. But the
learned single Judge modified the same and directed enquiry into the mesne profits from 1.1.1984
till date of delivery of possession. As rightly contended by Sri Chandra Sekhara Rao since 1st
respondent herself restricted her claim from 1.1.1984 to 30.11.1985 at Rs.3000/- per month, and did
not choose to amend the plaint, nor filed a rejoinder claiming higher amount as damages for that
period, she cannot be granted a higher rate of mesne profits than claimed by her from 1.1.1984 to
30.11.1985. She is entitled to mesne profits from 1.12.1985 till the date of recovery of possession at
such rate as may be determined by the Court, or a commissioner appointed for that purpose under
Order 20 Rule 12 C.P.C. The point is answered accordingly.
28. Before parting with the case we deem it necessary to give a finding with regard to deposit of
Rs.35,000/- made by the lessees under Ex.A.1 with the 1st respondent. Clauses 31 and 34 of Ex.A.1
read as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/52593961/ 13R.V. Bhupal Prasad vs Saleha Begum Alias Shehensha Begum And ... on 3 August, 2001
"31:The security deposit of Rs.35,000/- (Rupees Thirty Five Thousand only) shall not
bear any interest and shall be returned to the LESSEES by the LESSOR on the expiry
of the lease period. This security deposit is intended for timely payment of rent by the
LESSEES and proper handing over back of the possession of the schedule properties
on the expiry of the LEASE term. The LESSOR has the right to appropriate the
security deposit for damages and breach of contract and take steps to evict the
LESSEES if the lease rent and the property tax are not paid on the stipulated date or
if the demised premises and furniture are not handed over back
32. . .......
33. ........
34. The LESSEES are at liberty to mortgage their projectors, furniture and electrical
equipment such as fans, etc., and the LESSOR shall have no objection, provided the
LESSEES shall free the furniture from all encumbrances while delivering possession
of the furniture along with the demised properties to the LESSOR on the expiry of the
lease period, failing which the LESSOR is not only entitled to appropriate the security
deposit of Rs.35,000/- (Rupees Thirty Five Thousand only) towards damages and
breach of contract but also is entitled to recover the cost of furniture from the
LESSEES"
At page 3 of Ex.A.8 notice 1st respondent specifically alleged that the security deposit of Rs.35,000/-
has been appropriated by her towards breach of contract as agreed and as per the terms and
conditions of the lease deed (Ex.A.1). Appellant did not send a reply thereto. In para 9 (c) of the
plaint it is specifically averred that security deposit of Rs.35,000/- was appropriated by the 1st
respondent for the breach of contract as per the terms of the contract. Appellant did not state
anything about the said allegation either in his written statement or in any of the two additional
written statements filed by him, or his evidence as D.W.1. Since Ex.A.1 gave authority to the 1st
respondent to forfeit Rs.35,000/- in case the lessees fail to deliver possession of the property after
expiry of the period of lease, and since appellant did not object to the claim of the 1st respondent
that she appropriated that amount as per the agreement, action of the 1st respondent in forfeiting
Rs.35,000/- kept in deposit with her, cannot be found fault with.
29. In the result, the decree of eviction passed by the learned single Judge is confirmed. Appellant is
directed to deliver possession of Navarang Theatre with all the furniture and the improvements
made thereto to the 1st respondent within one month from today. 1st respondent is entitled to a
decree for Rs.40,250/- towards mesne profits from 1.1.1984 to 30.11.1985 as claimed in the plaint,
and is also entitled to mesne profits at the rate to be determined in a separate proceedings filed
under Order 20 Rule 12 C.P.C. for that purpose. The decree of the learned single Judge is modified
accordingly. The 1st respondent is entitled to costs through out. The appeal is ordered accordingly.
