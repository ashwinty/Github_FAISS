V.K. JAIN, J.
1. By this common order, we will dispose of all the writ petitions referred above, which involve a
common question of law.
2. The petitioner is a Government company, providing services, including catering on board the
trains run by Indian Railways, under identical contracts between the petitioner- company and
Indian Railways. The petitioner has also sub- leased the contract in respect of some trains to various
contractors. The consideration for these services is included in the fare charged by Indian Railways
from the passengers and the petitioner-company is paid, by Indian Railways, for what it terms as the
services, including catering provided by it to the passengers. The petitioner had in the past been
paying VAT, in respect of the services on board the trains, including providing of food and beverages
and the tax was paid up to 30th April, 2007.
3. Section 84 of Delhi Value Added Tax Act, 2004, to the extent it is relevant, provides that if any
determinable question arises, otherwise than in proceedings before a court, a person may apply in
the prescribed manner to the Commissioner for the determination of that question. The
determinable question includes as to whether a transaction is or would be a sale.
4. The petitioner sought a determination from the Commissioner of Value Added Tax, under Section
84 of Delhi Value Added Tax Act, 2004 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act") on the taxability to VAT
in respect of the food and beverages served to the passengers, on board the trains. The
determination was sought on the following questions:
"(1) Whether in the facts and circumstances and the „Agreements(cid:129) signed between Indian Railways
Catering & Tourism Corporation Limited and the Licensees, the food and beverages provided by the
Licensee(s) to the passengers on moving trains for consumption is in the nature of „sale/purchase(cid:129)
of food and beverages and whether it is liable to tax under the DVAT Act or that under the CST Act
in Delhi?
(2) Whether in the facts and circumstances and the „Agreements(cid:129) reached between Northern
Railways and the Indian Railways Catering & Tourism Corpn. Ltd., providing of food and beverages
by the Indian Railways Catering & Tourism Corpn. Ltd. to the passengers during journey on board
the running trains for consumption is „sale(cid:129) and whether the same is taxable under the DVAT Act;
or that under the CST Act in Delhi?
(3) Whether on the request of the Indian Railways Catering & Tourism Corpn. Ltd., the Licensees
are required to issue to the Corporation, the "Tax Invoices" in terms of Section 50 of the DVAT Act
and the Indian Railways Catering & Tourism Corpn. Ltd. is entitled to claim credit of input tax at the
time of working out the output tax payable by it in respect of the sales made by it to the Railways?"
5. Vide Determination Order dated 23.03.2006, the Commissioner of Value Added Tax held that
VAT was payable on the services provided on board the trains, since it amounted to sale within the
meaning of Section 2(zc)(vii) of the Act. He also took the view that there were three transactions of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/87087162/ 2Indian Railways Catering & Tourism ... vs Govt Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 19 July, 2010
sale, one from the licensee contractor to the petitioner, the second from the petitioner to the
Railways and the third from the Railways to the passengers.
6. In the Determination Order, the Commissioner, inter alia, observed as under:
"Therefore, it comes out to be a clear case of sale/supply of food and beverages first
by the Licensee(s)/Caterer(s) to the applicant Corporation, then by the applicant
Corporation to the Indian Railways and thereafter, ultimately by the Indian Railways
to the passengers on board. To put it in clear words, three sale transactions of food
and beverages, first by the Licensee(s)/Caterer(s) to the applicant Corporation,
second by the applicant Corporation to the Indian Railways and then the third by the
Indian Railways to the passengers on board the running trains are involved in the
whole process attracting tax at all stages under the Act. Further, in ease, the suppliers
i.e. the Licensee(s)/Caterer(s), the applicant Corporation and then the Indian
Railwaysare all located in Delhi, they all are personally liable to collect and pay the
value added tax on their sales transactions individually at 12.5% u/s 4(1)(e) of the
DVAT Act, 2004 in Delhi. Likewise, if the goods i.e. food and beverages are boarded
by the Licensee(s)/Caterer(s) in the trains in Delhi, despite the fact that the
Licensee(s) or the Caterer(s) are stationed/located outside Delhi and also the
supplies are made by them to the passengers on running trains outside Delhi, the
sales shall be treated to be the Local ones attracting tax under the provisions of DVAT
Act, 2004."
7. An appeal was filed by the petitioner before the Appellate Tribunal against the determination
made by the Commissioner. It was submitted by the petitioner before the Appellate Tribunal that it
did not have any grievance against the answers given by the Commissioner to the questions raised
by them in their application seeking determination. They, however, objected to the following
observations made by the Commissioner:
"However, in case, the first sellers i.e. the Licensee(s) and the Caterer(s) appointed by
the applicant Corporation in such a case are located outside Delhi and also board the
goods i.e. the raw materials etc. for preparing food and the beverages etc. for
supplying them to the passengers on running trains outside the State, then their sales
to the applicant Corporation shall be inter-State or say, outside the State while those
of the applicant to the Indian Railways local and then again by the Indian Railways to
the passengers inter-State attracting tax under the provisions of the DVAT Act, 2004
and the CST Act, 1956respectively. In this eventuality, the tax liability of the
Licensee(s)/Caterer(s) shall arise under the CST Act, 1956 in the State in which they
board thesupplies on the trains. In such a case, the Indian Railways alone and not the
applicant Corporation shall be entitled to demand from the applicant Corporation the
"Tax Invoice"in term of Section 50 of the Act and then claim the credit of input tax on
its basis from the Department. It is held and determined accordingly."

8. The contention before the Tribunal was that when the matter under reference was only with
regard to taxability of food and beverages loaded on trains from Delhi, there was no occasion for
him to observe regarding the taxability on the sale or purchase of goods taking place outside the
State. It was submitted that the observations, regarding taxability of goods on running trains outside
the State, was outside the ambit of Determination Order passed by the Commissioner. The Tribunal
accepted the contention and quashed the above- referred portion of the Determination Order passed
by the Commissioner.
9. The Assessment Order for the year 2007-08 was passed by Value Added Tax Officer (VATO),
following the Determination Order passed by the Commissioner of Value Added Tax. A Revision
Petition filed by the petitioner against the order was dismissed vide order dated 10.12.2008.
10. Service tax under Section 65(105)(zzt) of the Finance Act, 1994 is being paid by the petitioner in
respect of the transactions in question. The petitioner has been advised that there cannot be levy of
both, service tax as well as VAT, on the same transaction. It has also been stated in the petition that
catering services provided by an outdoor caterer on a train was fully exempt from service tax vide
notification dated 10.09.2004, but that notification was rescinded vide subsequent notification
dated 01.03.2006, which provides for 50% abatement, to the outdoor caterer. The case of the
petitioner is that if the transaction entered into by it is subject to service tax, it cannot be subjected
to levy of VAT and vice versa, since one transaction cannot be subjected to levy of both VAT as well
as service tax. The submission is that service tax and VAT/sales tax operate in different fields and
are mutually exclusive. The petitioner claims that on account of the Determination
Order/Assessment Order passed under the DVAT Act, the provisions of Section 2(zc)(vii) of the
DVAT Act, 2004 had come into direct conflict with the provisions of Section 65(105)(zzt) of the
Finance Act, 1994. It has also been alleged in the petition that the respondents are seeking VAT even
in respect of the food and beverages which are not loaded on the trains in Delhi.
11. The petitioner has accordingly sought a declaration that the services, rendered by it on board the
trains, are not liable to Value Added Tax and are liable to service tax alone. It has been further
prayed that in case it is held that the services provided by the petitioner alongwith food and
beverages, amount to sale of goods, the provisions of Section 65(105) (zzt) of Finance Act, 1994 be
declared ultra vires. The petitioner has also sought quashing of the Assessment Order in respect of
the year 2007-08 as well as the Determination Order dated 20.03.2006, besides seeking orders
restraining the respondents from levying sales tax/VAT on the services provided by the petitioner.
12. The petition has been contested only by respondent No.1-Government of NCT of Delhi and
respondent No.2- Commissioner of Value Added Tax. No reply has been filed by respondents 3 to 5.
The contesting respondents have taken a preliminary objection that the petitioner can file objections
under Section 74 of the DVAT Act in case it is aggrieved from the order passed by the VATO and a
further remedy of appeal before the Appellate Tribunal is also available to it against the order of the
Objection Hearing Authority.
13. It has been stated in the counter-affidavit that in the appeal filed by the petitioner against the
Determination Order passed by the Commissioner of Value added Tax, the Appellate Authority vide
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/87087162/ 4Indian Railways Catering & Tourism ... vs Govt Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 19 July, 2010
order dated 29.08.2006 held that only the food and beverages loaded in trains from Delhi were
liable to VAT and the sale and purchase of goods taking place outside Delhi, on the running trains,
were outside the ambit of Determination Order passed by the Commissioner of VAT. The order
passed by the Tribunal was not challenged by either party and, therefore, has become final. On
merits, it has been alleged that the petitioner was receiving consideration from Indian Railways in
respect of supply of food and beverages served to the passengers and, therefore, the transaction
amounts to sale in terms of Section 2(1)(zc) of the Act. It has also been stated that services provided
by the petitioner by employing staff to serve the food and beverages loaded from Delhi was
incidental to the business of supply of food, etc. and the invoices, issued by the petitioner, clearly
indicate that consideration was being received by it from Indian Railways for sale of food and
beverages. It has been further stated that the petitioner itself has admitted raising bills in respect of
supply of cooked food, water and newspapers. It has been clarified that no VAT has been demanded
in respect of supply of newspapers.
14. Since the order passed by the Tribunal has not been challenged by either party, the dispute
before us is confined to payment of VAT in respect of the food and beverages which are loaded on
board the trains in Delhi.
15. The procedure adopted for supply of food and beverages to the passengers is that the
licensee(s)/caterer(s), who supply the food and beverages to the passengers in the running trains,
raise sales bills and invoices in respect of those supplies, in favour of the petitioner-corporation
which, in turn, issues a consolidated sale invoice of such supplies in the name of Indian Railways
and receives the sale consideration from it.
16. It is an admitted position that the invoices are raised by the petitioner in favour of Indian
Railways in respect of three items (a) food; (b) beverages; and (c) newspaper. Admittedly, no VAT is
being claimed by the respondents in respect of newspapers. Admittedly, the payment is being taken
by the caterers/licensee from the petitioner-company, which raises bills in favour of Indian Railways
and takes payment from it. The food is loaded in the trains as per the reservation chart finalized by
Indian Railways and communicated to the petitioner. On completion of journey, the Train
Superintendent of Indian Railways issues certificate as to actual occupancy of seats from one station
to another. For example, in the case of August KrantiRajdhani, originating from Delhi and
terminating at Mumbai, the certificate will be issued by the Train Superintendent once the train
reaches Mumbai. The petitioner raises invoice upon Indian Railways towards food and water bottles
on the basis of occupancy of seats, certified by the Train Superintendent. The food on board the
train is served by the petitioner(cid:129)s men to the passengers. It is also the case of the petitioner that
usually water bottles are served in Delhi, whereas the food items are served when the train is passing
through another State.
17. As per the agreement between the petitioner-company and Indian Railways, the menu of the
food items as well as their cost is fixed by the Railway Board. The revenue is shared between Indian
Railways, the petitioner-company and the licensee/caterer engaged by the petitioner. For example,
on a gross billed amount of Rs 1 lakh, for catering, water and newspaper, 15% of the billed amount,
i.e., Rs 15,000/- is shared between Indian Railways and the petitioner-company. Indian Railways

retaining Rs 2250/- and the petitioner- company retaining Rs 12750/-. The balance amount of Rs
85,000/- is paid to the contractor.
18. It is also an admitted position that the meals cooked in the base kitchen and loaded on the trains,
are kept in the train compartments which are equipped with equipments required for catering, such
as boilers, freezers, hot boxes, etc. and these equipments are being provided and maintained by
Indian Railways.
19. Section 2(i)(zc) of DVAT Act, to the extent it is relevant, reads as under:
"(z)(c) "sale" with its grammatical variations and cognate expression means any transfer of property
in goods by one person to another for cash or for deferred payment or for other valuable
consideration (not including a grant or subvention payment made by one government agency or
department, whether of the central government or of any state government, to another) and
includes-
(vii) supply, by way of or as part of any service or in any other manner whatsoever, of goods, being
food or any other article for human consumption or any drink (whether or not intoxicating), where
such supply or service is for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;
20. Section 2(m) of the Act defines goods and to the extent it is relevant, the provision reads as
under:
"(m) "goods" means every kind of
moveable property (other than
newspapers, actionable claims, stocks, shares and securities) and includes-
(i) livestock, all materials, commodities, grass or things attached to or forming part of the earth
which are agreed to be severed before sale or under a contract of sale"
Section 2(7) of Sale of Goods Act defines, goods as under:-
"(7) "goods" means every kind of moveable property (other than actionable claims
and money; and includes stock and shares, growing crops, grass, and things attached
to or forming part of the land which are agreed to be served before sale or under the
contract of sale;"
21. Section 4(1) of Sale of Goods Act, which defines sale, to the extent it is relevant, reads as under:-
"4. Sale and agreement to sell- (1) A contract of sale of goods is a contract whereby
the seller transfers or agrees to transfer the property in goods to the buyer for a
price."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/87087162/ 6Indian Railways Catering & Tourism ... vs Govt Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 19 July, 2010
(3) Where under a contract of sale the property in the goods in transferred from the seller to the
buyer, the contract is called a sale, but where the transfer of the property in the goods is to take
place at a future time or subject to some condition thereafter to be fulfilled, the contract is called an
agreement to sell.
(4) An agreement to sell becomes a sale when the time elapses or the conditions are fulfilled subject
to which the property in the goods is to be transferred."
22. Section 23 of Sale of Goods Act, which deals with unascertained goods and appropriation, to the
extent it is relevant, reads as under:-
"23. Sale of unascertained goods and appropriation.- (1) Where there is a contract for the sale of
unascertained or future goods by description and goods of that description and in a deliverable state
are unconditionally appropriated to the contract, either by the seller with the assent of the buyer or
by the buyer with the assent of the seller, the property in the goods thereupon passes to the buyer.
Such assent may be expressed or implied, and may be given either before or after the appropriation
is made."
23. Section 26 of Sale of Goods Act, which deals with risk in the goods, to the extent it is relevant,
reads as under:
"26. Risk Prima facie passes with property.- Unless otherwise agreed, the goods
remain at the seller(cid:129)s risk until the property therein is transferred to the buyer, but
when the property therein is transferred to the buyer, the goods are at the buyer(cid:129)s
risk whether delivery has been made or not.
Provided also that nothing in this section shall affect the duties or liabilities of either
seller or buyer as bailee of the goods of the other party.
24. Section 33 of Sale of Goods Act, which deals with delivery of goods, to the extent it is relevant,
reads as under:
"33. Delivery.- Delivery of goods sold may be made by doing anything which the
parties agree shall be treated as delivery or which has the effect of putting the goods
in the possession of the buyer or of any person authorised to hold them on his
behalf."
25. An analysis of the definition of sale as given in Section 2(zc) of the Act and Section 4 of the Sale
of Goods Act would show that the following are the essential ingredients of sale as defined in the
Act:
(i) There should be transfer of property in the goods between one person to another,
which means that the ownership or title of the goods must necessarily get transferred
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/87087162/ 7Indian Railways Catering & Tourism ... vs Govt Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 19 July, 2010
from one person to another;
(ii) The transfer should be for cash or for deferred payment or for some other
valuable consideration.
It cannot be disputed and has not been disputed that the food articles and water, provided to the
passengers in the trains, are goods within the meaning of Section 2(7) of Sale of Goods Act and
Section 2(m) of the Act.
26. Since no tax is sought to be levied on Indian Railways, in the petitions before us, we are not
concerned with the transaction between Indian Railways and the passengers and, therefore need not
go into the question as to whether providing food by Indian Railways to the passenger, who travels
in its trains as part of the ticket price, can be said to be a service provided by the Railways to the
passenger or not. What we have to decide is as to whether the transaction between the
petitioner-company and Indian Railways is a contract of providing service or a composite contract of
providing service and selling goods or a contract only for sale/supply of goods.
27. In State of Madras Vs. Gannon Dunkerley & Co.(Madras) Limited : (1958) 9 STC 353 (SC), it was
held by the Supreme Court that the expression „sale of goods(cid:129) in Entry 48 in List II of Schedule 7 of
Government of India Act, 1935 cannot be construed in its popular sense but must be interpreted in
its legal sense and should be given the same meaning which it has in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, its
essential ingredients being an agreement to sell movables for a price and property passing therein
pursuant to that agreement. Thus, passing of property in the movable goods was held to be an
essential ingredients of sale. It was held that a contract under which a contractor agreed to set up a
building would not be a contract for sale since it was one contract, entire and indivisible and there
was no separate agreement for sale and goods justifying the levy of sales tax by the Provincial
Legislatures. It was observed that the parties could have provided for two independent agreements,
one relating to the labour and work involved in the execution of the work and erection of the
building and the second relating to the sale of the material used in the building in which case the
latter would be an agreement to sell and the supply of materials thereunder, a sale. Where there was
no such separation, the contract was a composite one. It was not classifiable as a sale.
28. In State of H.P. vs. Associated Hotels of India:(29) STC 474 (SC), the respondent-company,
which carried on business as hoteliers as part of its business, received guests in its several hotels to
whom, besides furnishing and lodging, it provided several amenities such as public and private
rooms, bath with hot and cold running water, linen, meals during stated hours, etc. The bill
tendered to the guest was an all- inclusive one, namely, a fixed amount for the stay in the hotel for
each day and did not contain different items in respect of each of these amenities. The question
before the Supreme Court was whether the respondent-company was liable to pay the sales tax
under the Punjab General Tax Act, 1948 in respect of meals served in the hotel, to guests coming
there for stay. The Supreme Court observed that the transaction being essentially one and
indivisible, namely, one of receiving a customer in the hotel to stay, it was essentially one service by
the hotelier, in the performance of which and as part of the amenities incidental to the service, the
hotelier serves meals in stated hours. It was held that the Revenue was not entitled to split up the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/87087162/ 8Indian Railways Catering & Tourism ... vs Govt Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 19 July, 2010
transaction into two parts; one of service and the other of sale of food stuff and to split up also the
bills charged by the hotelier as consisting of charges for lodging and charges for food stuffs served to
him, with a view to bring the latter under the Sales Tax Act. During the course of the judgment, it
was observed that even in the contract purely of work or service, it is possible that articles may have
to be used by the person executing the work and property in such article or materials may pass to
the other party, but, that would not necessarily convert the contract into one of sale of these
materials. It was held that in every case the Court would have to find out what was the primary
object of the transaction and the intention of the parties while entering into it.
29. In Northern India Caterers vs. Lieutenant Governor of Delhi: (1978) 48 STC 386 (SC), the
appellant was running a hotel in which lodging and meals were provided on inclusive terms to the
residents. Meals were also served to non- residents in the restaurant located in the hotel. The
appellant before the Court maintained that having regard to the nature of the services rendered,
there was no real difference between the two kinds of transactions and in both the cases it remained
a supply and service of food not amounting to sale. It was held by the Supreme Court that the service
of meals to the visitors in the restaurant of the appellant was not taxable under the Bengal Finance
(Sales Tax) Act, 1941 as extended to the Union Territory of Delhi.
Review petitions were filed against the above-referred judgment dated September 7, 1978, which
came to be decided vide judgment dated December 21, 1979. The respondents before the Court were
apprehensive that the benefit of the judgment would be invoked by restaurant-owners in those cases
also where there is a sale of food and title passes to the customers. After noticing that the facts
alleged by the appellant were never disputed at any stage and no attempt was made by taxing
authorities to enquire into the truth of the facts so stated, the Supreme Court observed that it was in
that factual context that it had examined the question whether any liability to sales tax was
attracted. As regards sale in restaurants, the Supreme Court, inter alia, held as under:
"Indeed, we have no hesitation in saying that where food is supplied in an eating
house or restaurant, and it is established upon the facts that the substance of the
transaction, evidenced by its dominant object, is a sale of food and the rendering of
services is merely incidental, the transaction would undoubtedly be exigible to
sales-tax. In every case it will be for the taxing authority to ascertain the facts when
making an assessment under the relevant sales tax law and to determine upon those
facts whether a sale of the food supplied is intended."
30. Pursuant to the Report of the Law Commission, Article 366 of the Constitution was amended by
inserting, vide Clause 29A, a definition of "tax on the sale or purchase of goods" used in Entry 54 in
the II list of the Schedule 7 of the Constitution, and to provide that such transfer, delivery or supply
of any goods shall be deemed to be a sale of those goods, by the person making transfer delivery or
supply and to the person to whom such transfer delivery or supply is made."
31. Clause 29A of Article 366, to the extent it is relevant, reads as under:-
"(29A) "tax on the sale or purchase of goods" includes-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/87087162/ 9Indian Railways Catering & Tourism ... vs Govt Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 19 July, 2010
(f) a tax on the supply, by way of or as part of any service or in any other manner
whatsoever, of goods, being food or any other article for human consumption or any
drink (whether or not intoxicating), where such supply or service is for cash, deferred
payment or other valuable consideration, and such transfer, delivery or supply of any
goods shall be deemed to be a sale of those goods by the person making the transfer,
delivery or supply and a purchase of those goods by the person to whom such
transfer, delivery or supply is made;']
32. All the sub-clauses of Article 366(29A) serve to bring transactions, where one or more of the
essential ingredients of a sale as defined in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 are absent, within the ambit
of purchases and sales for the purpose of levy of Sales Tax. To this extent, the principle enunciated
by Supreme Court in the case of Gannon Dunkerley & Co.(Madras) Limited (supra) now stands
diluted. The catering contract has thus been brought within the fiction of a „deemed sale(cid:129) and
splitting of service and supply in respect of such a contract has been constitutionally permitted. The
decision of Supreme Court in the case of Associated Hotels (supra) has thus been legislatively
invalidated by the 46th Constitutional Amendment.
33. In K. Damodarasamy Naidu & Bros. Vs. State of Tamil Nadu & Anr.:(2000) 117 STC 1 (SC), the
issue relating to the right of the States to levy tax on the sale of food and drink vide Entry 54 of List
II of the 7th Schedule to the Constitution came up for consideration before Supreme Court.
Referring to its earlier decision in the case of Northern India Caterers (India) Ltd. v. Lt. Governor of
Delhi: (1978) 4 SCC 36, it was noted that by reason of the Constitution (46th Amendment) Act,
1982, as a result of the amendment in Clause 29A to Article 366 of the Constitution, the State had
become entitled to levy a tax on the supply of food and drink. It was contended before the Supreme
Court that in the eye of the law, the tax on food served in restaurants could not be levied on the sum
total of the price charged to the customer, since restaurants provided services in addition to food,
and these had to be accounted for. It was pointed out that the restaurants provided an elegant decor,
uniformed waiters, good linen, crockery and cutlery and could even provide music and dance floors.
It was contended that the bill that the customer paid, had therefore, to be split up between what was
charged for such service and what was charged for the food. Repelling the contention, Supreme
Court, inter alia, held as under:
"The tax, therefore, is on the supply of food or drink and it is not of relevance that the
supply is by way of a service or as part of a service. In our view, therefore, the price
that the customer pays for the supply of food in a restaurant cannot be split up as
suggested by learned Counsel. The supply of food by the restaurant owner to the
customer, though it may be a part of the service that he renders by providing good
furniture, furnishing and fixtures, linen, crockery and cutlery, music, a dance floor
and a floor show, is what is the subject of the levy. The patron of a fancy restaurant
who orders a plate of cheese sandwiches whose price is shown to be Rs 50 on the bill
of fare knows very well that the innate cost of the bread, butter, mustard and cheese
in the plate is very much less, but he orders it all the same. He pays Rs 50 for its
supply and it is on Rs 50 that the restaurant owner must be taxed."

34. In The East India Hotels vs. Union of India: (121) STC 46 (SC), it was contended before the
Supreme Court that on a correct interpretation of Delhi Sales Act, 1975, the sales made in the
restaurant could not be taxed even after 46th Amendment to the Constitution. Rejecting the reliance
placed by the petitioners on Northern India Caterer's (supra), Supreme Court, inter alia, held as
under:
"9. According to Section 2(g), all movable properties, materials, articles or
commodities are goods. Therefore, food in a restaurant has necessarily to be regarded
as goods. According to Section 2(l), transfer of property in goods by one person to
another would amount to sale. With cooked food or food which is supplied in a
restaurant falling within the definition of the word "goods" in Section 2(g), transfer of
property in the same would amount to sale as provided by Section 2(l).
12. In the present case, when a customer goes to a restaurant and orders food and in
respect of which he pays the price indicated therein and the said food items are
supplied to him, it would clearly be a case of transfer of property in goods to the
customer. Whether the customer eats the entire or part of the dish or chooses not to
eat at all would make no difference if he pays for the dishes supplied. The moment
the dish is supplied and sale price paid, it would amount to a sale."
35. In Commissioner of Sales Tax vs. Departmental Catering (Northern Railways): (2006) 146 STC
287 (Delhi), the respondent was operating at New Delhi Railway Station and Parliament House,
besides providing catering in running trains. While holding that selling of food stuffs by the
respondent amounted to sale, this Court relied upon the following observations made by the
Supreme Court in the case of Northern India Caterers (supra):-
"Further, that where food is supplied in an eating-house or restaurant, and it is
established upon the facts and the substance of the transaction, evidenced by its
dominant object, is a sale of food and the rendering of services is merely incidental,
the transaction would undoubtedly be exigible to sales tax. In every case, it will be for
the taxing authority to ascertain the facts when making an assessment under the
relevant sales tax law and to determine upon those facts whether a sale of the food
supplied is intended."
36. In Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. and Anr. vs. Union of India and Ors.:145 STC 91 (SC), the
principal question involved in the case was the nature of the transaction, by which mobile phone
connections are enjoyed, whether it was a sale or a service or both. The case of the service providers
before the Court was that there was no sale transaction involved and the attempt of some States to
levy tax on the provision of mobile phone facilities by them, to the subscribers, was constitutionally
incompetent, the transaction in question being merely a service. The States, on the other hand,
contended that the transaction was a deemed sale under Article 366(29A)(d) of the Constitution,
read with the charging sections in the various sales tax enactments and, therefore, they were
competent to levy sales tax on the transactions. It was held by the Supreme Court that the goods do
not include electromagnetic waves or radio frequencies for the purpose of Article 366(29A)(d) and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/87087162/ 11Indian Railways Catering & Tourism ... vs Govt Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 19 July, 2010
the goods in telecommunication are limited to the handsets, provided by the service provider. As far
as SIM cards were concerned, the issue was left for determination by the Assessing Authority. It was
further held that nature of the transaction, involved in providing the telephone connection may be a
composite contract of service and sale and it is possible for the State to tax the sale element provided
there is a discernible sale and only to the extent relatable to such sale. It was also held that the
aspect theory, i.e., different aspects of a given transaction can fall within the legislative competence
of two Legislatures and both would have the power to tax that aspect would not apply to enable the
value of services to be included in the sale of goods or the parts of goods in the value of the services.
During the course of the judgment, it was observed that there was no denial of the legislative
competence of the States to levy tax on sales provided that the concomitants of a sale are present in
the transaction and the sale is distinctly discernible in the transaction, but that does not allow the
State to entrench upon the Union List and tax services by including the cost of such service in the
value of the goods. It was held that even in those composite contracts, which are by legal fiction,
deemed to be visible under Article 366(29A) the value of the goods involved in the execution of the
whole transaction cannot be assessed to sales tax. The Supreme Court, in the course of the
judgment, inter alia, observed as under:-
"For reasons ultimately attributable to the principle enunciated in Gannon Dunkerley
& Co.(Madras) Limited case (supra), namely, if there is an instrument of contract
which may be composite in form in any case other than the exceptions in Article
366(29A), unless the transaction in truth represents two distinct and separate
contracts and is discernible as such, then the State would not have the power to
separate the agreement to sell from the agreement to render service, and impose tax
on the sale. The test therefore, for composite contracts other than those mentioned in
Article 366 (29A), continues to be - did the parties have in mind or intend separate
rights arising out of the sale of goods. If there was no such intention there is no sale
even if the contract could be disintegrated. The test for deciding whether a contract
falls into one category or the other is to as what is `the substance of the contract'. We
will for want of a better phrase, call this the dominant nature test."
37. The legal propositions, which emerge from a careful analysis of the above-referred decisions, can
be summarized as under:-
(a) It is open to the States to levy sales tax/Value Added Tax, on the whole of the
consideration, in transactions of sale of goods, such as sale to a customer in a
restaurant, irrespective of the incidental element of service which is necessarily
involved in sale of goods of this nature;
(b) If the transaction between the parties is covered under Article 366 (29A) of the
Constitution, it is permissible for the States to levy and collect sales tax/Value Added
Tax on the value of the goods involved in the execution of the transaction.
It is not permissible to levy sales tax/ Value Added Tax in respect of service component of such
composite transactions and;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/87087162/ 12Indian Railways Catering & Tourism ... vs Govt Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 19 July, 2010
(c) In respect of composite transactions, other than those covered by Article 366(29A) of the
Constitution, if it is found that the intention of the parties was to segregate the element involving
sale of goods from the element involving providing of service and actually the transaction represents
distinct contracts which are clearly discernible, the State would have the power to separate the
agreement involving sale of goods, from the agreement to provide services, and impose tax on the
sale component of the transaction. If no such intention is found or the transaction does not involve
two distinct contracts, one for sale of goods and the other for providing of services, it is not
permissible to disintegrate such a composite contract so as to levy sales tax/ Value Added Tax on
that component which involves sale of goods, during the course of the transaction. The test for
deciding whether the composite contract falls in the first category or in the second category would
be to ascertain what is the dominant nature of the transaction between the parties.
38. As regards outdoor catering services, Supreme Court in the case of Tamil Nadu Kalyana
Mandapam Assn. vs. Union of India (UOI) and Ors.:(2004) 135 STC 480 noted as under:
"Similarly the services rendered by outdoor caterers are clearly distinguishable from
the service rendered in a restaurant or hotel inasmuch as, in the case of outdoor
catering service the food/eatables/drinks are the choice of the person who partakes
the services. He is free to choose the kind, quantum and manner in which the food is
to be served. But in the case of restaurant, the customer's choice of foods is limited to
the menu card. Again in the case of outdoor catering, the customer is at liberty to
choose the time and place where the food is to be served. In the case of an outdoor
caterer, the customer negotiates each element of the catering service, including the
price to be paid to the caterer. Outdoor catering has an element of personalized
service provided to the customer. Clearly the service element is more weighty, visible
and predominant in the case of outdoor catering. It cannot be considered as a case of
sale of food and drink as in restaurant."
39. It was contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the transaction between the
petitioner-company and Indian Railways amounted to catering services which attract levy of service
tax and, therefore, cannot be subjected to levy of Value Added Tax. We are unable to accept the
contention. As far as providing of food, snacks and water to the passengers on board the trains are
concerned, the transaction, in our view, is altogether different from an outdoor catering service.
Admittedly, the passengers travelling in the trains are served food and beverages as per a fixed
menu approved by Railway Board. Neither the petitioner nor the passenger has any choice in
respect of articles to be served in the trains or with respect to the quantity each passenger gets. It is
not open to a passenger to ask for a food article of his choice, since neither such a food article is
available in the train nor is the preparation or supply of food article as per the choice of the
passenger, envisaged under the contract between the petitioner-company and Indian Railways. If
the fixed menu provides, for say, supply of one samosa and one cake to a passenger, he cannot ask
for more than one samosa or more than one cake even on payment basis. He cannot even ask for a
samosa in lieu of cakes or vice versa. He has absolutely no choice in the matter. The passenger has
no role to play even with respect to the time and/or place at which the meals/snacks will be served
to him. In fact, the passenger has absolutely no say in the matters relating to food/snacks, etc.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/87087162/ 13Indian Railways Catering & Tourism ... vs Govt Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 19 July, 2010
provided to him in the train. He gets no refund from the Railways if he does not like or does not take
the meals offered to him in the compartment. The requisite charges in this regard are taken from
him by Indian Railways at the time of purchase of ticket by him and he pays the same charges in the
ticket, irrespective of whether he wants meals in the trains or not. If the passenger does not take the
meals at the time it is offered to him, he does not get it at all. Thus, there is no element of service at
all, except heating the cooked food and serving the food and beverages. In fact, the service
component in respect of sale of food in a restaurant is much more than supply of food to a passenger
in a compartment of a train. If sales tax or VAT is leviable on the whole of the amount of bill paid in
a restaurant, as held by the Supreme Court in the case of K. Damodarasamy Naidu & Bros. and The
East India Hotels (supra), it is difficult to say that it is not leviable in respect of food, provided to a
passenger in a train. The service element, involved in providing meals to a passenger travelling in a
train, is incidental and bare minimal required in selling of a food article/beverage to a customer. In
fact, even in a shop- cum-restaurant, the meals are heated and beverages refrigerated and then
served to the customer on his table in the crockery and cutlery provided by the
shop-cum-restaurant. Even while selling a meal/snack/beverage off the counter, the seller heats the
meal/snack and delivers cold/hot beverage to the customer. No one will buy meals/snacks if they
are not hot, a soft drink, if it is not cold or a tea/coffee if it is not hot. The element of service,
involved in serving a passenger travelling in a train, therefore, cannot be said to be higher than that
involved in selling cooked food in a shop or in a restaurant.
40. The learned counsel for the petitioner has sought support from the decision of Supreme Court in
the case of Tamil Nadu Kalyana Mandapam Assn. (supra). In that case, the members of the
appellant-association, who were the owners of owners of Kalyana Mandapam /Mandapam-keepers,
used to let out Mandapam /premises to the clients. In addition to letting out the Kalyana
Mandapam, they were also providing other facilities such as catering, electricity, water etc. to their
clients. After introduction of service tax in India, vide Finance Act, 1994, the services provided to a
client of a Mandapam- keeper in relation to a use of Mandapam in any manner, including the
facilities provided to the client in relation to such use and also the services, if any, rendered as a
caterer were brought with the purview of service tax. The value of a taxable service in relation to the
service provided by a Mandapam- keeper was prescribed as the gross amount charged by such
keeper from the client for the use of Mandapam, including the facilities provided to him in relation
to such use and also the charges for catering, if any. The Central Government issued a notification
exempting an amount of service tax leviable on a Mandapam-keeper in excess of amount of service
tax, calculated on 60% of the gross amount charged from the client by the Mandapam-keeper. The
notification also provided that the exemption shall apply only in such cases where the
Mandapam-keepers also provide catering services and the bills indicated that it was inclusive of
charges for catering services. It was contended before Supreme Court that service tax on
Mandapam-keeper was unconstitutional, as it was a tax on goods and/or land and not a tax on the
services and, therefore, was not in the domain of the Union. It was observed by the Supreme Court
that for the tax to amount to a „tax on sale of goods(cid:129), it must amount to a sale, according to the
established concept of a sale and the Legislature cannot enlarge the definition of sale, so as to bring
within ambit of taxation, transaction, which could not be a sale in law. It was further observed that
Article 366(29A) only permits the State to impose a tax on the supply of food and drink but it does
not conceptually or otherwise include the supply of services within the definition of sale and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/87087162/ 14Indian Railways Catering & Tourism ... vs Govt Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 19 July, 2010
purchase of goods. It was held that since the concept of catering includes the concept of rendering
services, the fact that tax on sale of goods, involved in the said service can be levied, does not mean
that the service tax cannot be levied on the service aspect of catering. It was held that making
available the premises for being utilized as a Mandapam, whether with or without services, would
itself be a service and cannot be classified as any other kind of legal concept and does not involve
transfer of movable property. It was noted that Mandapam-keepers provide a wide variety of
services apart from the service of allowing temporary occupation of Mandapam. A
Mandapam-keeper, apart from maintenance of Mandapam, also provides the necessary
paraphernalia for holding such functions, as well as the conditions and ambience which are required
by the customer, such as providing the lighting arrangements, furniture and fixtures, floor coverings
etc. It was further observed that the services provided by him cover method and manner of
decorating and organising the Mandapam and the keeper provides the customer with advice as to
what should be the quantum and quality of the services required, keeping in view the requirement of
the customer and the nature of the event to be solemnized etc. It was noted that the logistics of
setting up, selection and maintenance is the responsibility of the Mandapam keeper and that the
services provided by him were professional services, which he alone, by virtue of experience, has the
wherewithal to provide. It was further noted that a customer goes to a Mandapam-keeper not
merely for the food that they will provide, but for the entire variety of services provided therein,
which results in providing the function to be solemnized with the required effect and ambience.
41. In our view, serving cooked food to a passenger in the compartment of a train is not at all
comparable with the extensive and varied services, provided by a Mandapam- keeper. No
arrangement of any kind is involved in serving cooked food to the passenger and no professional
advice or expertise is given to him. No logistics, for the customers, are involved in serving the food
and there is no question of organizing something for the passenger. Therefore, reliance on this
judgment, in our view, is wholly misplaced.
42. The judgment in the case of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. (supra) also is of no help to the
petitioner since the transaction of providing meals and snacks to the passengers, to our minds, is
not a composite contract of service and sale, but is a transaction of outright sale by the
petitioner-company to the Indian Railways. The service component, involved in the transaction, is
purely incidental and minimal necessary for the purpose of sale of those goods.
43. The learned counsel for the petitioner has also referred to Associated Hotels of India Ltd. vs.
Excise and Taxation Officer and Anr.: (1966) 17 STC 555 and State of Punjab vs. Associated Hotels of
India: (1967) 20 STC (1), where it was held that the hoteliers, who make consolidated charge for
providing their clients with residential accommodation, services, linen, food, etc. and who do not
allow any rebate if food is not taken or served transfer the food to the customers for consideration
though the restaurants sales of non-residents and sales of packed food by the petitioner-company to
its customers are taxable under the Punjab Act. These judgments are not attracted to the
transactions before us which cannot be treated at par with a transaction of providing consolidated
services of accommodation, linen, food, etc. to the resident customers in a hotel and which are like
that of sale to non-residents or restaurant sale to a non-resident customer.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/87087162/ 15Indian Railways Catering & Tourism ... vs Govt Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 19 July, 2010
44. Reliance has also been placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Imagic Creative vs.
Commissioner of Commercial Taxes:(12) VST 371 (SC). In this case, the appellant, an advertising
agency, provided advertisement services by creating original concept and design advertising
material and design brochures, annual report etc. The appellant was assessed under Karnataka Sales
Tax Act, after deducting, from its gross turnover, the items such as taxes, discount and service
charges, design and art work charges in which no transfer of property was involved, advertisement
charges and sales outside the State. However, the Appropriate Authority ruled that the entire sale
value, including the creation concept done by the appellant, formed part of the value of the sale and
tax had to be imposed on the entire sale value. Reversing the decision of the Appropriate Authority
and affirming the order of the Assessing Authority, Supreme Court held that it was a case of
composite contract of a service provider and in such a case sales tax would not be payable on the
value of the entire contract, irrespective of the element of services provided. It was held that a
composite contract of this nature was not a works contract. This judgment is not attracted to the
facts of the case before us since element of service, involved in serving meals and snacks to the
passengers, travelling in a train, cannot be treated at par with the services provided by an
advertising agency in the form of consultancy, design and art work where no transfer of property is
involved. The transaction between the petitioner-company and Indian Railways cannot be said to be
a composite transaction, involving sale of goods as well as providing of services.
45. The learned counsel for the petitioner has also referred to the decision of this Court in S.T.
Appeal No.10/2009, Commissioner, VAT Trade and Taxes Department vs. International Travel
House Ltd. In that case, the respondent had entered into an agreement with NDPL for hire of Omni
vans. As per the contract, the respondent was to provide Omni vans on 24 hours/2500 Km per
month per vehicle on a monthly cumulative basis @ Rs. 23,000/- per vehicle per month and 16
(sixteen) non-AC Omni vans on 12 hour/3000 Km basis @ Rs. 16,000/- car/per month. Extra Km
above the cumulative 48000 Km per month was to be paid @ Rs. 4/Km and extra hours of duty in
excess of 12 hours/day of duty @ Rs. 15/hr. The respondent was also obliged to ensure a number of
other things, including uniform of chauffeurs and mobiles to them. The issues before this Court
were (a) whether the transaction in question was sale within the meaning of Article 366(29A)(d);
and (b) whether the contracts in question were contracts for service? It was contended before this
Court that the contract satisfied the requirement of sale since there was a transfer of right to use the
goods for valuable consideration and effective control and possession of cabs had been given to
NDPL. The contention of the respondent, however, was that the transaction in question was not a
transaction of sale because the effective control and possession of the goods remained with the
respondent, since the vehicles were driven by its drivers and all the licences and permission were in
the name of the respondent. It was also contended on behalf of the respondent that since it was
already paying service tax to the Central Government, the transaction in question, being services
under the Central Act, the State Act cannot come in the conflict of Central Act. If this conflict arises,
the State Act must necessarily give way to the Central Act. It was held by this Court that since the
permission and licences with respect to the cabs were not available to the transferee and remained
in control of possession of the respondents, it cannot be said that there was sale of goods by transfer
of right to use goods inasmuch as a necessary ingredient of the sale, being the transfer of right to use
the goods was absent.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/87087162/ 16Indian Railways Catering & Tourism ... vs Govt Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 19 July, 2010
The nature of the contract between Indian Railways and the petitioner-company is altogether
different from the nature of the contract between NDPL and International Travel House Ltd., which
was a subject matter of S.T. Appeal No.10/2009 and, therefore, this judgment does not advance the
case of the petitioner in any manner.
46. Since these is transfer of goods, by the petitioner company to Indian Railways, for consideration
and the property in the goods also passes to Indian Railways, the transaction between them is no
doubt a case purely of sale of goods under the provisions of Sale of Goods Act as well as Delhi Value
Added Tax Act and the element of service by way of heating the food, heating/freezing the beverages
and then serving them to the passengers is purely incidental and minimal required for sale of food
and beverage in a transaction of this nature. There is no privity of contract between to
petitioner-company and the passengers travelling in trains. No package of services is being provided
to Indian Railways, by the petitioner-company. It is neither a contract for providing service nor a
composite contract for sale/supply of goods and providing of service by the petition-company to
Indian Railways. The contesting respondents are, therefore, entitled to levy and demand VAT, on
the entire amount of consideration paid by Indian Railways to the petitioner-company for food and
beverages.
47. In the case of Northern Caterers (supra) one of the reasons for holding that the transaction was
not a sale, was that the customer had no right to take away the unconsumed food. There is no such
prohibition on the passengers travelling in trains. Since the transaction in a restaurant has, in
subsequent decisions, been held to be a sale, despite the Court taking the view that the customer had
no right to take away the unconsumed food, these is no good reason to take a different view in a
transaction involving a train passenger, to whom even such a disability is not attached.
48. It was contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that merely on loading of the cooked
food in the trains, the property or title in the goods does not get transferred to Indian Railways and
since the meals and snacks are served after the train leaves Delhi, it cannot be said that the sale, if
any, to the Indian Railways is made in the territory of Delhi. We are unable to accept the contention.
Admittedly, the meals and snacks are kept in the hot boxes and refrigerators, belonging to the
Indian Railways and provided in the train compartments. The moment the goods are loaded in train
and are kept in those equipments, belonging to Indian Railways, the property in the goods gets
transferred to Indian Railways. It would then be immaterial that these goods are served to the
passengers after the train has left the territory of Delhi. Once the property in those goods is
transferred to Indian Railways, on account of their being loaded on the trains and kept in the
gadgets belonging to Indian Railways, those goods become the property of Railways and at the time
of service of those goods to the passengers, title in the goods vests in the Railways and not in the
petitioner-company. If we accept the contention that the property in the goods is transferred to
Indian Railways only when they are served to the passengers that would result in a situation where it
will not be possible even to ascertain the place where the property in the goods passes to Indian
Railways. Let us illustrate it by giving an example. If say biscuits are to be served to the passengers,
the train may be in territory of one State when they are served to some of the passengers, whereas it
may be in the territory of another State when they are served to the other passengers. We need to
appreciate that the train keeps on running when these goods are served to the passengers and not all
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/87087162/ 17Indian Railways Catering & Tourism ... vs Govt Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 19 July, 2010
of them can be served at the same time. If the argument is accepted, the sale in respect of the goods
served to some of the passengers may take place in one State, whereas sale in respect of the goods,
served to the remaining passengers may take place in another State. If the food articles/beverages to
be served are more than one, which normally is the case, one snack/meal may be served in the
territory of one State, the second snack/meal may be served in the territory of the second State and
the third snack/meal may be served in the territory of third State. If the contention, advanced by the
learned counsel for the petitioner is accepted, it will be difficult to find out which goods attract levy
of sales tax/VAT in one State and which goods attract levy of similar tax in another State. As noted
earlier, even the sale of one particular meal may take place in more than one States, since some
passengers may get it in one State, whereas another passenger may get it in another State. The Court
needs to avoid taking an interpretation which will result in a statutory provision becoming
unworkable and incapable of implementation.
49. It was contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that if unfortunately some accident is
to take place before the food is served to the passengers, the petitioner will not get paid for the food
loaded in the train which shows that the property in the goods does not pass to the Railways till they
are served to the passengers. We, however, find that no such stipulation in the agreement of the
petitioner with Indian Railways. In view of the provisions of Section 26 of the Sale of Goods Act, the
risk in the goods would be of Indian Railways once they are loaded on the train and kept in the
equipment, belonging to the railways since the statutory provision is subject to agreement between
the parties, nothing prevents the petitioner agreeing to bear the risk, despite property in the goods
having already been transferred to the purchaser. It is important in such cases, to separate the risk
factor, from passing of title in the goods. The seller may, if he so decides, agree to bear the risk even
in those cases, where the property in the goods has passed to the buyer, and acceptance of risk by
the seller does not necessarily exclude passing of property in the goods to the buyer. The ownership
of the goods in such cases vests in the buyer, whereas the risk is incurred by the seller, by virtue of
his agreement with the buyer. In fact, in a given case, the buyer may agree to bear the risk, even
before the property in the goods passes to him. It is all a matter of agreement between the parties. It
is an admitted position that the reservation chart of Indian Railways is supplied to the
petitioner-company and the meals/snacks/beverages are loaded in the train, considering the
number of passengers booked on the train. The petitioner-company knows, in advance, the number
of passengers likely to board the train. Therefore, it cannot be said that the petitioner-company is
loading excess or indefinite quantity of such goods on the train and consequently, the property in
the goods does not pass to Indian Railways when they are loaded on the train. Section 33 of Sale of
Goods Act provides for delivery of the goods by doing anything which the parties agree to treat as
delivery or which has the effect of putting the goods in the possession of the buyer or any person
authorized to hold them on his behalf. Since as per the agreement of the petitioner-Indian Railways,
the goods are to be loaded on trains and kept in the equipment such as refrigerators and hot boxes
owned by Indian Railways, this amounts to delivery of the goods to Railways and putting the goods
into its possession, within the ambit of Section 33 of Sale of Goods Act. In fact, delivery of goods
need not always be physical, and may, in appropriate cases, also be symbolic. This proposition finds
statutory recognition in Section 33 of Sale of Goods Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/87087162/ 18Indian Railways Catering & Tourism ... vs Govt Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 19 July, 2010
50. It is true that at the time of execution of contract between the petitioner-company and Indian
Railways, the goods, subject matter of the contract, are not ascertained and, in fact, the meals and
snacks are not even in existence, since they have to be prepared at a later date. But, in view of the
provision contained in Section 23 of Sale of Goods Act, as soon as the meals and snacks are cooked
and, being in a deliverable state, are appropriated to the contract by loading them on the
compartments of Indian Railways and keeping them in the equipment belonging to the Railways,
the property in the goods passes to the Indian Railways.
51. Admittedly, payment to the petitioner is required to be made by Indian Railways even if the food
is not consumed by the passenger. This is yet another circumstance, indicating transfer of property
in the goods to the Indian Railways on their being loaded on the train and are being kept in the
gadgets of Indian Railways.
52. It was vehemently urged by the learned counsel for the petitioner that since the petitioner is
already assessed to service tax in respect of the same transaction albeit with 50% abatement, it
cannot be subjected to levy of Value Added Tax and in any case, the Value Added Tax can be levied
only in respect of 50% of the transactional cost which is given as abatement to the
petitioner-company. Since in our view, the transaction between the petitioner-companyand Indian
Railways, is a transaction purely of sale of goods and not a composite transaction for sale of goods
and rendering of services, we cannot accept the contention advanced by the learned counsel. Section
2(zd) of the Act, to the extent it is relevant provides that sales price means the amount paid or
payable as valuable consideration for any sale, including any sum charged for anything done by the
dealer in respect of the goods at the time of or before the delivery thereof. Therefore, the
respondents, in our view, are entitled to levy and demand Value Added Tax on the whole of the
consideration paid by the Indian Railways to the petitioner-company. It would be relevant to note
here that the State is competent to levy sales tax/Value Added Tax on the entire sale consideration
in respect of sale of goods and we cannot deny the constitutional right to State to levy such a tax
merely because tax authorities have also collected service tax from the petitioner on the assumption
that the contract between the parties was a contract of providing services or a composite agreement
of providing services and goods. The petitioner has not prayed for refund of the service tax paid by
it. It has only challenged constitutional validity of Section 65(105)(zzt) of Finance Act, 1994 since it
permits levy of service tax on „outdoor catering service.(cid:129) Since respondents 3 to 5 have not come
forward to file a reply and no arguments have been advanced before us on this question, we need not
go further into this aspect of the matter. It is not our view that service tax cannot be levied on
outdoor catering, as provided in Section 65(105)(zzt) of Finance Act, 1994. In our view, the
transaction between the petitioner and Indian Railways does not amount to a contract of providing
outdoor catering, but, is a transaction of sale of food and beverages by the petitioner- company to
Indian Railways.
53. It was pointed out by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner-company is paid
for snacks only in respect of those number of passengers, who actually board the train which shows
that the property in the goods does not pass to Indian Railways till the time they are served to the
passengers. We cannot accept the contentions. The property in the goods in its transferred to Indian
Railways, as soon as they are loaded on the compartments and kept in their equipment. If the

petitioner-company has agreed, with Indian Railways, to charge only with respect to that quantity
which is expected to be served to the passengers, who actually board the train, it is a matter of
contract between the two parties and that by itself would not show that the property in the goods
does not get transferred to Indian Railways on their loading on the compartments. As noted earlier,
even out of those passengers, who actually board the train, some of them may not consume these
meals/snacks, but the Indian Railways does pay to the petitioner for all the passengers boarding the
train. It is, therefore, a business decision taken by the petitioner-company, considering all pros and
cons to charge from Indian Railways, only for that much quantity which is attributable to the
number of persons actually boarding the train.
54. For the reasons given in the preceding paragraphs, we hold that the transaction between the
petitioner-company and Indian Railways for providing food and beverages to the passengers, on
board the trains, is a transaction of sale of goods by the petitioner-company to Indian Railways. It is
neither a contract for providing services nor a composite contract for supply of goods and providing
of services. We also hold that sale in respect of goods loaded on board the trains in Delhi, takes
place, when the goods are loaded in the trains. Accordingly, we find no merit in the writ petitions
and the same are hereby dismissed. It will, however, be open to the petitioner to claim refund of
service tax already paid by it in respect of such transactions. If the refund is declined, the petitioner
will be at liberty to initiate such proceedings, as may be open to it in law in this regard. If service tax
is sought to be levied, upon the petitioner, in future, in respect of such transactions, it will be open
to it, to challenge the same in appropriate proceedings.
The writ petitions stand disposed of.
