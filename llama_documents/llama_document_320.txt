FACTS LEADING TO FILING OF TWO WRIT PETITIONS:
2. In the first writ petition being WPA No. 31234 of 2017, the writ petitioner has assailed the order
dated 04.04.2013 passed by the Director General, Boarder Security Force (herein referred to as The
D.G, BSF), Block-10, CGO Complex, New Delhi -110003 in appeals/representations filed by the Jail
Authority as well as through his counsel under Section 117 of Boarder Security Force Act, 1968 (BSF
Act) thereby declared the petitioner as guilty and further confirmed the judgment and order of
conviction dated 17.04.2012 passed by Learned General Security Force Court (hereinafter referred
to as 'GSF Court') in a Trial, No. 941062422 Constable Vijay Prakash of 140 BN BSF, whereby
convicted him for an offence committed under Section 46 of the Boarder Security Force Act, 1968
that is say for murder and attempt to murder punishable under Sections 302 and 307 of the Indian
Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced him "To Suffer Life imprisonment and to be dismissed from
service".
The contention of the Petitioner is that appeal was considered by the Respondent No. 3 only on the
basis of aforesaid written representations/ appeals. No proper appreciation or marshalling of
evidences either oral or documentary adduced by the Prosecution have been taken into
consideration by the Respondent No. 3. Surprisingly, no opportunity was afforded to the Petitioner
to place the case through his learned counsel and thereby violated the principles of natural justice.
The Respondent No.3 decided the case without applying his judicious mind and finally confirmed
the judgment and order dated 17.04.2012 passed by the GSF Court illegally and erroneously
contending therein simply that the appeal is devoid of merit.
Feeling aggrieved by and dissatisfied with the order dated 04.04.2013 passed by the Respondent No.
3/the D.G, BSF, the writ petitioner had earlier preferred a Writ Petition being WP(C) No. 4462 of
2013 before the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi at New Delhi through his earlier counsel on the
impression that the territorial jurisdiction lies before the Delhi High Court as the head office of the
Appellate Authority is situated in New Delhi. In the said writ petition, the Hon'ble High Court of
Delhi on several occasions, directed to file reply and rejoinder to the parties but at the time of
hearing, a preliminary question of territorial jurisdiction was raised by the respondents since the
alleged incident took place within the State of West Bengal and Trial held in West Bengal on the
basis of case originated in the West Bengal. Accordingly, the writ petitioner had to seek before the
Hon'ble High Court of Delhi for withdrawal of the writ petition and the said prayer for withdrawal of
the said writ petition was simply allowed on 11.12.2014 by the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi.
3. Thereafter, the writ petitioner filed first writ petition being WPA No. 31234 of 2017 before this
court seeking for setting aside and/or quashing of the purported order dated 04.04.2013 passed by
the D.G, BSF and impugned judgment and order dated 17.04.2012 passed by the General Security
Force Court with other consequential relief.
4. The said first writ petition was heard by Hon'ble Justice Arindam Mukherjee of this Court on
05.10.2021 and after hearing and considering the provision laid down in Border Security Force Act
and Rules framed thereunder, His Lordship was pleased to pass an order, inter alia, as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59752143/ 2Ex. Ct. Vijay Prakash vs Union Of India And Ors on 12 February, 2024
"A sentence can be suspended under the provisions of Section 130 read with section
117(2) of the BSF Act.
On a reading of the various provisions of the BSF Act and the Rules framed
thereunder, it appears to me that the same is a complete Code in itself. In fact, in
cases where an employee of the BSF is charged of criminal offence and is ordinarily to
be tried by the jurisdictional Magistrate and/or the Sessions Court as the case may
be, the GSFC has the power to hold trial even in such a case by themselves. The
petitioner in the instant case was charged amongst other with an offence under
section 302 of the Indian Penal Code 1860 (in short, IPC). This offence is ordinarily
triable by the Criminal Court in terms of the provisions of the Code of Criminal
Procedure 1973 (in short, Cr.P.C), but by dint of powers conferred under the BSF Act,
the GSFC tried the petitioner. This emboldens the view that BSF Act is a complete
code in itself. The suspension of the sentence therefore, has been prayed as per the
provisions of the BSF Act.
On a harmonious reading of the provisions of section 117(2) and 130 of the BSF Act, I
am of the view, that primarily an application has to be made to the concerned
authority following the provisions of section 130, even in a case where the sentence
has been confirmed and the propriety of the order is under challenge before a High
Court in writ jurisdiction.
Taking a lenient view of the petitioner's prayer for suspension of sentence as made in
the application, being CAN 2 of 2021, despite a previous application on the self-same
cause is pending, I think justice will be sub-
served if I direct the petitioner to make a fresh application/representation before the
Director General, Border Security Force, being the respondent no. 3 in the instant
writ petition for suspension of sentence in terms of the provisions of Section 130 read
with Section 117(2) of the BSF Act, by 25th October, 2021.
In the event, such application is made, the Director General, Border Security Force
shall decide the same irrespective of the fact whether the previous application said to
have been forwarded by the Jail Authorities on 1st February, 2019, has been disposed
of or not.
The entire exercise shall be concluded within a period of three months from the date
of the petitioner making such application and/or representation.
In the event, the respondent no. 3, to whom the application and/or representation is
directed to be made is of the view that he is not the Competent Authority to suspend
the sentence then he shall forward such application and/or representation of the
petitioner to the authority concerned who according to him is competent to take
cognizance of the petitioner's application and consider the prayer for suspension of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59752143/ 3Ex. Ct. Vijay Prakash vs Union Of India And Ors on 12 February, 2024
sentence.
This order is passed considering the prayer for suspension of sentence made by the
petitioner is a consequential relief sought for during the pendency of the writ petition
though the same has not been directly prayed for in the writ petition."
5. In pursuant to the aforesaid order passed by the Co-ordinate Bench of this court on 05.10.2021,
petitioner made a fresh application/representation dated 18.10.2021 before the Respondent No. 3
on 19.10.2021 which was received by the Office of Respondent No. 3 on 21.10.2021 but
unfortunately, the order of the Hon'ble Court was not complied and concluded within a period of
three months. As such, the petitioner issued a contempt notice upon the Respondent No. 3 and upon
receipt of the contempt notice, the Respondent No. 3 passed an order immediately on 29.04.2022
thereby disallowed the prayer for suspension of sentence rather again confirmed the judgment and
order passed by the GSF Court on 29.04.2022 holding therein that the case is not fit for suspension
of sentence and affirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence passed as aforesaid.
6. Thereafter, Petitioner having no other efficacious alternative remedy against the impugned order
dated 29.04.2022 passed by the D.G, BSF , filed a second writ petition being WPA 15518 of 2022 on
13.07.2022 with more or less similar payers seeking to quash and set aside the purported order
dated 29.04.2022 passed by Respondent No. 3 and also direction for release of the Petitioner (now
in jail) on suspension of the sentence dated 17.04.2012 passed by the GSF Court with consequential
reliefs on several grounds as under : -
i) The Respondent No. 3 neither considered the points as raised by the Petitioner nor
properly appreciated the oral and documentary evidences brought on record by the
prosecution;
ii) The Respondent No. 3 has not afforded an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner
as such he grossly violated the principles of natural justice;
iii) The judgment and order passed by the learned GSF Court is based on surmises
and conjectures and same is liable to be set aside;
iv) The GSF Court ignored the oral evidence of the eye witnesses i.e. P.Ws. 3, 9, 14, 15
and 18. They did not support the prosecution case though they were present at the
place of occurrence;
v) The learned GSF Court did not consider specially the independent vital public eye
witnesses i.e. P.Ws. 9 and 18, who did not support the prosecution version in any
manner and blot out the entire prosecution case;
vi) The learned GSF Court also did not consider the evidence of eye witnesses who
state that originally a scuffle took place in between BSF 'G' and petitioner and thereby
an incident of firing occurred;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59752143/ 4Ex. Ct. Vijay Prakash vs Union Of India And Ors on 12 February, 2024
vii) The learned GSF Court did not consider that the prosecution has failed to prove
the motive or intention or pre-meditation of the BSF Jawan/Petitioner thereby
illegally convicted and sentenced the petitioner under Sections 302/307 of the IPC
read with Section 46 of the BSF Act, 1968 is liable to be set aside;
viii) The learned GSF Court did not consider the material contradictions and
inconsistency in the statements of the officials and public witnesses and thereby
grossly ignored the entire material evidences adduced by the Prosecution and
convicted and sentenced the petitioner though he is entitled to get benefit of doubts;
ix) The Respondent No. 3 did not consider that the petitioner has already suffered
more than 11 years' imprisonment without any fault;
x) The learned GSF Court as well as Respondent No. 3 have infringed the
fundamental rights of the petitioner and imposed incorrect conviction and sentence
calls for immediate judicial intervention by this Court under its writ jurisdiction;
xi) The learned GSF Court did not consider the alleged incident/ offences come
within the purview of Section 304 II of the Indian Penal code;
xii) The learned GSF Court or the Respondent No. 3 further erred in holding that the prosecution
proved the case under Section 307 of the IPC though it does not attract in the instant case.
7. Both writ petitions were assigned before this Bench by the Hon'ble Chief Justice for disposal.
Hence, both writ petitions are taken up for disposal.
FACTS OF THE CASE:
8. The factual matrix of the case is relevant for the purpose of disposal of the instant case as under:
On 01.12.2010 at about 17.00 hrs Constable No. 94106242 Vijay Prakash, petitioner
herein and Constable No. 02145820 Sanjeev Kumar Rai while returning from OP
duty stopped at the shop of a Civilian, Shri Jogai Sarkar to purchase gutka and
cigarette etc. which is about 300 yards away from BOP Satimari. Ct. Sanjeev Kumar
Rai who was his buddy pair waited for some time but Ct. Vijay Prakash told Ct.
Sanjeev Kumar Rai to go to BOP Satimari, he will come soon. When Ct. Sanjeev
Kumar Rai reached at BOP Satimari, Offg Coy Commander No. 77287006 Inspr Md.
Yaqub inquired about his buddy pair, and then Ct. Sanjeev Kumar Rai informed that
the petitioner has consumed liquor. He is standing at the shop of Jogai Sarkar in the
village in intoxicated condition. Immediately, Inspector Md. Yaqub, Offg Coy
Commander along with No. 86005119 HC (G) Tarsem Lal and No. 94403510 CT/DVr
Gulam Mohammad left to bring Ct. Vijay Prakash back to BOP. On reaching at the

shop keeper, upon enquiring, Shri Jogai Sarkar said that he was telling Ct. Vijay
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59752143/ 5Ex. Ct. Vijay Prakash vs Union Of India And Ors on 12 February, 2024
Prakash to go to BOP as he is in intoxicated condition but he was not ready to go
from the shop. Inspr. Md. Yaqub, Offg Coy Commander also told the petitioner to
proceed towards the BOP but he did not move. Offg Coy Comdr reported the entire
matter to the Adjutant of the unit on mobile. On this, the petitioner became furious
and went towards the other side of the road where his bicycle was standing and
suddenly cocked his personal weapon 5.56 mm INSAS Rifle Butt No. 584, body no.
16610357 and started firing indiscriminately towards the shop where Inspr. Md.
Yaqub, Offg Coy Commander, HC (G) Tarsem Lal and some other civilians were
standing. Tarsem Lal saw Ct. Vijay Prakash cocking his personal weapon, rushed
towards him to prevent him from firing, but in the process of preventing such firing,
he was hit by bullet in his right hand. The petitioner started firing, Inspr. Md. Yaqub,
Offg Coy Commander, HC (G) Tarsem Lal and other civilians, who were standing
near the shop, ran away from the site towards the village Chandipur to save them
from the firing. Ct. Vijay Prakash also escaped from the spot by taking advantage of
darkness after firing. On hearing the sound of fire, CQMH of the Coy No. 87009666
HC Satheesan N K took out a party of 10-12 personnel available in the coy for rescue
towards the place of occurrence. When the rescue party reached about 100 yards
from the BOP, No. 02145874 Ct. Addya Prasad saw bicycle of Ct. Vijay Prakash lying
on the ground along with his personal weapon and a carry bag containing a pouch
which contained one filled magazine with 20 Rds of 5.56 mm INSAS and one empty
Mag and one Mag containing 20 Rds of 5.56 mm INSAS was fitted on weapon. Later
the rescue party saw that Inspr. Md. Yaqub, Offg Coy Commander was being beaten
by civilian as such the party immediately rescued him. During the firing, one civilian
namely, Gopal Tudu, S/o John Tudu aged about 21 years of Vill- Chandipur
(Satimari) was hit by a bullet in his abdomen. Immediately, the civilians removed the
injured civilian to PHC Kushmandi, who after the first aid was further referred to
Dist. Hospital Raiganj. Thereafter, Gopal Tudu was further referred by the treating
doctor at Dist. Hospital Raiganj to North Bengal Medical College and Hospital,
Siliguri, where he succumbed to his injuries on 02.12.2010 at about 06.30 hrs. HC
(G) Tarsem Lal also sustained bullet injury in his right hand was also removed to
SHQ BDF Hospital Raiganj, where after the first aid, he was further referred to Dist.
Hospital, Raiganj. Wherefrom he was further referred to BSF Composite Hospital, Kadamtala on
02.12.2010 and, thereafter, on 3rd Dec, 2010 sent to Anandlok Hospital, Siliguri where he remains
admitted till 13th Dec, 2010. After the incident, a civilian, father of deceased lodged an FIR against
the petitioner under Section 302 IPC resulting in registration of Kushmandi P.S. GDE No. 85 dated
02.12.2010, corresponding to Kushmandi P.S. Case No. 106/10 dated 02.12.2010 under Section 302
IPC. On the same line, BSF also lodged another FIR on issue of firing and murder of one civilian etc.
Subsequently, the case was transferred on 29th September, 2011 for trial to the learned General
Security Force Court from the Ld. Court of ACJM, Gangarampur at Buniadpur as per the provision
of BSF Act, 1968.

CONVICTION AND SENTENCES
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59752143/ 8Ex. Ct. Vijay Prakash vs Union Of India And Ors on 12 February, 2024
11. Thereafter, the arguments were advanced by the parties before the learned GSF Court. After
hearing the arguments of the both sides and after marshalling and appreciation of oral and
documentary evidence adduced by the prosecution, learned GSF Court came to a final conclusion
that the petitioner is the person, who started firing indiscriminately resulted in murder of one
civilian boy and injured one BSF personnel on his hand and found him guilty of the alleged offences
and convicted him for an offence committed under Section 46 of the Boarder Security Force Act,
1968 that is to say for murder and attempt to murder punishable under Sections 302 and 307 of the
Indian Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced him "To Suffer Life imprisonment and to be dismissed from
service" on 17.04.2012. Under the above circumstances, the present writ petitions have come up
before this Bench for adjudication. SUBMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER:
12. Ms. Ashima Mandla with Mr. Surya Prakash Singh, Ms. Ritu Das and Mr.
Sangkrito Ray Chowdhuri, learned advocates appearing on behalf of the petitioner
vehemently argued that in spite of making a fresh application dated 18.10.2021 in
pursuant to the order dated 05.10.2021 passed by this Hon'ble High Court, the
Respondent No. 3 unfortunately did not consider or dispose of the application even
after expiry of time bound direction of three months. Petitioner has issued a
contempt notice upon the Respondent No. 3 through his Learned Advocate. After
receiving the said contempt notice, the Respondent No. 3 hurriedly passed an order
on 29.04.2022 thereby rejected the prayer for suspension of sentence without
affording an opportunity of hearing to the petitioner. The impugned order also bears
no reasons and a cryptic one which is liable to be set aside.
13. It is further submitted that the Respondent No. 3 overlooked the grounds set forth
and evidences, both oral and documentary as adduced by the prosecution and finally
dismissed the application only on the basis of surmises and conjectures avoiding the
true facts and material evidences available on the record. No personal hearing was
given to the petitioner as such grossly violated the principles of natural justice. It is
the basic principle of natural justice that a reasonable opportunity of being heard to
be given to the petitioner but the Respondent No. 3 avoided and surreptitiously
jumped and passed only to comply the direction of the Hon'ble High Court without
going into the merits of the case or applying judicious mind. The learned GSF Court
failed to appreciate the oral evidences adduced by the prosecution particularly the
eye witnesses i.e. P.Ws. 9 and 18.
The learned GSF Court also failed to consider under which situation and circumstances, the incident
was occurred and directly convicted the petitioner under Sections 302/307 though there was no
intention or motive or pre-meditation on the part of petitioner for such incident. There was no prior
enmity with the private individuals or officials of the BSF. The said incident was taken place owing
to scuffle and sudden provocative statement uttered by P.W. 14. It can be easily ascertained the
actual truth from the evidence of eye witness (P.W. 9), who is the shop owner of provisional shop
situated at Village Chandipur, P.S. Kushmandi, where the incident occurred.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59752143/ 9Ex. Ct. Vijay Prakash vs Union Of India And Ors on 12 February, 2024
14. It is further submitted that allegation of altercation/argument took place between petitioner and
shop owner was never happened at all. Prosecution miserably failed to prove the allegation that the
petitioner was under influence of liquor and picked up an altercation with the shop owner. All these
facts have not been considered by the learned GSF Court or Appellate Authority and finally
dismissed his application whimsically and capriciously without affording an opportunity of being
heard to the petitioner. Therefore, this writ petitions are maintainable because there is no other
alternative efficacious remedy for his grievances as prayed for as such it can be allowed after setting
aside the order dated 29.04.2022 passed by the Appellate Authority and judgment and order dated
17.04.2012 passed by the Learned GSF Court in exercising power under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India. Ld. Advocate placed reliance of a judgment reported in Ram Prasad Saini Vs
UOI and Anr.1 in support of her contention.
15. It is further submitted that the person, who sustained bullet injury died due to delay in removing
to the hospital and insufficient medical facilities. It is specifically stated by the prosecution
witnesses 2012 SCC Online Del 5160 that no BSF personnel help to remove the deceased for his
treatment. He was travelled from one place to another and finally succumbed. If he would have been
given proper medical treatment in time, he would have been alive. The allegation of suffering bullet
injury by P.W. 14 is also not proved. He suffered simple injury in his hand during scuffle but
prosecution has given impression that he suffered bullet injury on his hand as such the Petitioner
has not committed an offence under Section 307 IPC. At best, it would be Section 308 Part II of the
IPC. The Learned GSF Court erroneously convicted the petitioner under Sections 302/307 IPC
though it would be at best Sections 300 Part II/308 of the IPC because sudden quarrel or altercation
took place between the P.W. 14 and the petitioner at the place of occurrence and same has been
corroborated by the eye witness P.W. 9, shop owner and P.W. 18, who was present at the spot. The
altercation and scuffle actually taken place between the petitioner and P.W. 14 at the place of
occurrence as per the statement of P.W. 18, who is one of the vital eye witnesses and he was present
at the place of occurrence, where the petitioner went to purchase Gutka, Cigarette etc.
16. Finally, in alternatively, learned advocate submitted that as the incident occurred in the course
of sudden quarrel or altercation and in a fit of passion when the BSF personnel informed the higher
officer about the false allegation against the petitioner that he engaged in altercation with shop
keeper under influence of liquor and further provoked by saying "Oye Vijay Prakash Kya Marega
Kisi Ko". There was no intention to kill or assault anyone as it transpires from the evidence of eye
witnesses P.W. 9 and P.W 18. They did not support the prosecution case. Secondly, other eye
witnesses also not supported the case of the prosecution. There was no prior intention or motive or
pre-meditation on the part of the petitioner for such incident. There was no prior enmity with the
private individuals or officials of the BSF. She prayed that his sentence may be scaled down to
culpable homicide not amounting to murder after considering Exception 1 and Exception 4 of
Section 300 of the Indian Panel Code. Petitioner has already suffered imprisonment for more than
11 years as such he should be released from the case as he had suffered maximum punishment. To
bolster her submission and contention, she places reliance of judgments as under:
i) Sukhdev Singh V. Delhi State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi)2

ii) Bhagwan Singh vs. State of Uttarakhand3
iii) Anbazhagan Vs. State4
iv) Tholan V. State of Tamilnadu5 SUBMISSION ON BEHALF OF THE
RESPONDENTS:
17. Per contra, Mr. Dayashankar Mishra, with Ms. Sabnam Laskar, learned advocates for the
respondents, on the other hand, vociferously argued and raised preliminary issue with regard to
maintainability of Writ Petitions on the self-same issues and grounds after withdrawal of earlier writ
petition filed before the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi. No liberty was granted by the Hon'ble Delhi
High Court for filing a fresh writ petition as such both writ petitions are liable to be dismissed at the
threshold. There is no provision to entertain writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India when the case has been finally dismissed by the Appellate Authority in an appeal filed under
Section 117 of the BSF Act, 1968. The said Act is itself a complete code.
(2003) 7 SCC 441;
(2020) 14 SCC 184;
(2023) SCC online SC 857;
(1984)2 SCC 133.
18. It is further submitted that the petitioner was habitual offender. He was enrolled in BSF with
effect from September 7, 1994 and from the very beginning of his service he was awarded seven
punishments for his indiscipline acts. He never adhered to any rules and regulations of the BSF so
no leniency can be shown to him.
19. It is further submitted that the D.G, BSF has examined all the points raised by the petitioner in
his petition seeking suspension of sentence, the evidences brought by the prosecution in the
proceeding before the learned GSF Court and all attending facts and circumstances of the case, the
Respondent No. 3 finally came to the conclusion that in view of the nature of offences, where the
petitioner had indulged in indiscriminate firing in civil area on his superiors and civilians resulting
in killing one civilian boy and bullet injuries suffered by P.W. 14, rightly confirmed the sentence and
disallowed the prayer for suspension of sentence under section 117 of the BSF Act earlier on 04.04.
2013. Furthermore, in the second time also in the same line, Director General further passed an
order on 29.04.2022 being a discretionary power under Section 130 of the said Act taking into
consideration of Petitioner's past conduct and penalties imposed during his period of service. The
BSF Act is itself a self-contained statute, which deals with the cases of BSF personnel for their
commission of offences in civil areas. Petitioner has availed all his grievances under the said Act as
such he cannot avail any further relief by filing fresh writ petitions as such those petitions are not at
all maintainable and liable to be dismissed. To bolster his contention, he placed reliance of
judgments as under:

20. It is further submitted that the prosecution has established the charges against
the petitioner beyond any reasonable doubt before the learned GSF Court through
oral and documentary evidence. P.W.s 3, 9, 10, 11, 14 and 15 have established that the
petitioner was under the influence of liquor and he had cocked his riffle and started
firing indiscriminately with an intention to kill AIR 1987 Supreme Court 88;
AIR 1998 Rajasthan 277.
officials and civilian who were present at the spot. Due to such indiscriminate firing, one civilian boy
and employee of BSF, P.W. 14 suffered bullet injuries in his right hand. Subsequently, civilian boy
expired as such the Learned GSF Court rightly convicted and sentenced the petitioner with life
imprisonment and dismissed from service. Later the conviction and sentence were confirmed by the
Appellate Authority. There is no question of sudden provocation and scuffle between the officials of
the BSF and Petitioner. Actually, the officials of BSF moved to the place of occurrence to bring the
Petitioner as his buddy partner informed, he was arguing with the shop owner under the influence
of liquor. They were requesting and asking him to go to BPO Satimari from the spot as he was under
influence of liquor and he was disturbing the civilians. He had not paid amount of
gutkha and cigarettes to the shop owner (P.W. 9). P.W. 9 specifically stated in his
evidence that petitioner had not paid any amount to him. At the same time, his
previous antecedent is also not good. So, question of interference of such conviction
and sentence by this Court does not arise at all rather the writ petitions are devoid of
merits and liable to be dismissed.
21. It is further submitted that the Learned GSF Court has not violated any of the
procedures as laid down in the said Act during whole trial. Court has given ample
opportunity to the petitioner for cross-examination and to adduce defence witness on
his behalf as such learned Court had in no way violated the procedure as prescribed
in the said Act as such allegation of not affording opportunity being heard is false,
baseless, unfounded and devoid of merits. Both writ petitions are totally based on
suppression of facts, vexatious and frivolous as such not sustainable in the eye of law.
Hence, Petitioner is not entitled to any relief sought for under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India.
22. Finally, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondents, vehemently opposed the prayer
for scaling down to culpable homicide not amounting to murder after considering Exception 1 and
Exception 4 of Section 300 of the Indian Panel Code and it sentences and further submitted that it is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59752143/ 12Ex. Ct. Vijay Prakash vs Union Of India And Ors on 12 February, 2024
the clear case of murder because the Petitioner/convict started firing indiscriminately towards the
officials of BSF Jawan and civilians. Petitioner's act of indiscriminate firing cannot be said to be
come under the purview of Exception 1 or Exception 4 of Section 300 of IPC because petitioner
being the BSF jawan was working for more than 17 years of service and he was fully aware about the
consequences of his indiscriminately firing in civil areas by INSAS rifle. He fired on several rounds
as such he is not entitled to get any benefits. Prosecution has established its case of murder and
attempt to murder under Sections 302/307 IPC beyond reasonable doubt. Consequently, instant
writ petitioners are devoid of merit and deserve to be dismissed. DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS
23. Heard the rival submissions of the parties and on meticulously perusal of record, it is not
disputed that one civilian, Gopal Tudu died due to bullet injury and one official of BSF suffered
injury on his right hand. The whole case is based on eye witnesses, who were present at the spot,
where the incident took place on the fateful date i.e., on 01.12.2010. Eye witnesses i.e., P.Ws. 3, 9,
14, 15 and 18 are the vital witnesses. So, let me scan their evidences one by one. But before entering
into the merits of the case, it would be appropriate to decide the preliminary issue raised by the
Respondents as under:
(a) Whether the writ petitions are not maintainable, when it was withdrawn by the
petitioner without seeking liberty to file afresh?
24. With regard to the maintainability of the writ petitions, it is true that the petitioner had
withdrawn the Writ Petition from the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi at New Delhi and the said prayer
was pleased to allow vide order dated 11.12.2014 by the Hon'ble High Court. It is correct that no
liberty sought for filing writ petition afresh or liberty granted by the Hon'ble High Court but it is
contended by the Writ Petitioner that previously appointed Ld. counsel appearing on behalf of the
petitioner wrongly filed the Writ Petition before the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi at New Delhi on
the impression that the office/ head office of the Appellate Authority, who rejected the prayer of the
petitioner in appeal filed under Section 130 read with Section 117 of the BSF Act is situated in New
Delhi. The Hon'ble High Court of Delhi at New Delhi initially admitted the writ petition and,
thereafter, on several occasions, directed to file reply and rejoinder to the parties but at the time of
final hearing, a preliminary question of territorial jurisdiction was raised by the Respondents as the
alleged incident took place and Trial held within the State of West Bengal on the basis of incident
originated within the District of Dakhin Dinajpur, West Bengal. Accordingly, the writ petitioner had
to seek before the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi for withdrawal of the writ petition and file the same
in Calcutta High Court at Calcutta and the said prayer for withdrawal of the said writ petition was
simply allowed on 11.12.2014. There is no reflection in the order regarding liberty to file afresh writ
petition within the actual territorial jurisdiction. It is admitted facts that the incident occurred and
entire trial held within the territorial jurisdiction of the West Bengal, which comes within the
territorial jurisdiction of the Hon'ble High Court at Calcutta. Accordingly, the writ petitioner has
filed a writ petition being WPA No. 31234 of 2017 and after hearing both sides, the Hon'ble High
Court entertained the Writ Petition and vide order dated 05.10.2021 directed the petitioner to make
a fresh application/representation before the Director General, Border Security Force, being the
Respondent No. 3 in the first writ petition for suspension of sentence in terms of the provisions of
Section 130 read with Section 117(2) of the BSF Act by 25th October, 2021.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59752143/ 13Ex. Ct. Vijay Prakash vs Union Of India And Ors on 12 February, 2024
In the event, such application is made, the Director General, Border Security Force shall decide the
same irrespective of the fact whether the previous application said to have been forwarded by the
Jail Authorities on 1st February, 2019, has been disposed of or not.
The entire exercise shall be concluded within a period of three months from the date of the
petitioner making such application and/or representation. The application made by the Petitioner
was finally decided and rejected the prayer of the petitioner by the DG, BSF on 29.04.2022, which
has now been challenged in another writ petition. Petitioner has not suppressed any facts rather he
disclosed complete facts and further justified the reasons for filing of the writ petitions before this
court.
The Judgment relied on behalf of the petitioner is also justified. Because in the referred judgment,
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Daryao V. State of U.P.8 held that if the petition filed in the High
Court under Article 226 is dismissed not on the merits because of the laches of the party applying
for the writ or because it is held that the party had an alternative remedy available to a subsequent
petition. If a writ petition is dismissed in limini and an order is pronounced in that behalf, whether
or not the dismissal would constitute a bar would depend upon the nature or the order. If the order
is on the merits, it would be a bar. If the petition is dismissed in limini without passing a speaking
order then such dismissal cannot be treated as creating a bar of res judicata.
The judgments referred as aforesaid on behalf of the Respondents are not applicable in the instant
case because facts and 1961 SCC Online SC 21 circumstances of the instant case are different. The
petitioner has not suppressed any facts rather he disclosed complete facts and further justified
reasons for filing of the writ petitions. The Hon'ble High Court of Delhi simply allowed his prayer
vide order dated 11.12.2014. The said order of dismissal as withdrawn was not on merits.
Furthermore, it is admitted fact that the incident occurred in Dakshin Dinajpur, West Bengal and
whole trial held at HQ 140 BN BSF, Maheshpur (Raiganj) within the State of West Bengal i.e. within
the territorial jurisdiction of the Hon'ble High Court at Calcutta.
In addition to that, this Court would also like to place the decisions referred by the Respondents
reported in:
1) Sarguja Transport Service Vs. State Transport Appellate Tribunal, Gwalior and
others and
2) M/S Rajasthan Art Emporium V. Rajasthan State Industrial and Investment
Corpn. and another.
In the first case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held in paragraph 9 of the said judgment as follows:
"9. the point for consideration is whether a petitioner after withdrawing a writ
petition filed by him in the High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution of India
without the permission to institute a fresh petition can file a fresh writ petition in the
High Court under that Article. On this point the decision in Daryao's case (supra) is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59752143/ 14Ex. Ct. Vijay Prakash vs Union Of India And Ors on 12 February, 2024
of no assistance. But we are of the view that the principle underlying R. 1 of O. XXIII
of the Code should be extended in the interests of administration of justice to cases of
withdrawal of writ petition also, not on the ground of res judicata but on the ground
of public policy as explained above. It would also discourage the litigant from
indulging in bench-hunting tactics. In any event there is no justifiable reason in such
a case to permit a petitioner to invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High
Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution once again. While the withdrawal of a writ
petition filed in High Court without permission to file a fresh writ petition may not
bar other remedies like a suit or a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution since
such withdrawal does not amount to res judicata, the remedy under Art. 226 of the
Constitution should be deemed to have been abandoned by the petitioner in respect
of the cause of action relied on in the writ petition when he withdraws it without such
permission. In the instant case the High Court was right in holding that a fresh writ
petition was not maintainable before it in respect of the same subject-matter since
the earlier writ petition had been withdrawn without permission to file a fresh
petition. We, however, make it clear that whatever we have stated in this order may
not be considered as being applicable to a writ petition involving the personal liberty
of an individual in which the petitioner prays for the issue of a writ in the nature of
habeas corpus or seeks to enforce the fundamental right guaranteed under Art. 21 of
the Constitution since such a case stands on a different footing altogether. We
however, leave this question open."
In the second case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held in paragraphs 10 and 20 as follows:
"10. In the instant case, as the petitioner has approached this Court earlier, the
submission made by Mr. Mathur that the petition is not maintainable is full of
substance. Mr. Kothari, learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the
earlier writ petition had been filed against the judgment and order of the Tax
Tribunal and this petition is filed against the order dated 26-7-97, which was
subsequent to the judgment of the Tax Tribunal and by the said order dated 26-7-97,
the RIICO has rejected his application to delete the said condition, therefore, being a
separate cause of action, it cannot be said that the writ petition is barred by the
principle enshrined in Order XXIII, Rule 1, I.P.C. In the facts and circumstances of
the case, as the same Condition had been challenged before the Rajasthan Taxation
Tribunal and the contention raised by the petitioner had been negative and the
judgment and order of the Tax Tribunal had been challenged before this Court by
filing the earlier writ petition, and as the petitioner was not likely to get any relief
from the Court, he had chosen to withdraw the said writ petition without getting the
liberty to file another writ petition, the submissions made by Mr. Kothari are not
tenable.
20. The contractual obligations are generally not disputed in writ jurisdiction.
Petitioner has entered into the agreement with the respondents and he was under no
compulsion to purchase the said property if the condition was not suitable to him.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59752143/ 15Ex. Ct. Vijay Prakash vs Union Of India And Ors on 12 February, 2024
Entering into the contract was by no means compulsion for him, thus it cannot be
described as Hobson's choice. Petitioner is an industrialist and it was not a case of a
weaker person who was not in a position to bargain with a company and even if the
condition imposed is arbitrary and liable to be quashed, it cannot be done so as the
petitioner had already filed the writ petition and got it dismissed as withdrawn
without any further liberty to file the petition and it made the petition not
maintainable."
However, in the instant case, withdrawal of writ petition by the petitioner from the Hon'ble High
Court of Delhi at New Delhi is not tantamount to abandon his grievances or decided on merits.
Furthermore, question of personal liberty is involved herein as he has been convicted and sentence
"To Suffer Life imprisonment and to be dismissed from service". Appellate Authority dismissed his
application/appeal under Section 117 of the BSF Act, 1968 without applying his judicious mind and
affording opportunity of being heard to the petitioner is a clear violation of principle of natural
justice. Petitioner has withdrawn the said writ petition from the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi only on
the ground of lack of territorial jurisdiction and same was filed by the previous conducting Ld.
Advocate on the impression that the Office/Head Quarter of the Respondents is situated under the
territorial jurisdiction of the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi and said question of territorial jurisdiction
was raised by the Respondents while hearing the case. The said prayer for withdrawal was simply
allowed by the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi but the said writ petition was not decided on merits. It is
not the contention of the Respondents that writ petitioner has abandoned his prayer in respect of
the cause of action arose in the said writ petition when he withdraws it and furthermore, there is no
allegation that the writ petitioner is indulging in bench-hunting tactics. The writ petitioner has filed
these writ petitions before this Court and not in the same High Court as such question of bench-
hunting tactics also does not arise. Hence, there are justifiable reasons to entertain the writ petitions
invoking an extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution as
this Court has territorial jurisdiction to entertain the same as the alleged incident occurred in
Dakshin Dinajpur, West Bengal and whole trial held within the State of West Bengal i.e., within the
territorial jurisdiction of the Hon'ble High Court at Calcutta. Therefore, these writ petitions are well
maintainable.
Now, this Court would like to proceed with the case on merits after scanning and appreciation of the
evidence, oral and documentary brought on record by the prosecution and considering the
contentions of both parties. Entire case is based on eye witnesses i.e. P.W. Nos. 3, 9, 14, 15 and 18.
They are the vital eye witnesses.
25. P.W. 9, Shop keeper, specifically narrated in his evidence that one BSF Jawan (petitioner herein)
came to his shop for purchasing Gutka and cigarette on the fateful day. After purchasing, he remains
standing outside the shop. At that time, one lady and 4-5 civilian customers were also present there.
In the meantime, he saw one vehicle of the Coy Commander reached there. He got down and
enquired about the jawan from him. Then he replied nothing has happened. In the meantime, he
was busy in attending other customers and went inside his shop, at that point of time, Coy
Commander started talking with that BSF Jawan (petitioner). What all transpired between them, he
is not aware about that. At that point of time, some arguments were taken place between the Coy
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59752143/ 16Ex. Ct. Vijay Prakash vs Union Of India And Ors on 12 February, 2024
Commander (P.W. 3) and that Jawan (Petitioner herein). He also noticed that BSF 'G' person
standing near by the Gypsy, which was parked on the other side of the road side. He also noticed
that a scuffle took place between the BSF 'G' person and that BSF Jawan. After a while firing took
place. It is further stated that when the firing took place, Gopal Tudu was standing in his shop. P.W.
9 ran away towards his house and his shop was closed by his brother. Next day he came to know that
one bullet hit the BSF 'G' personnel and one civilian Gopal Tudu. Later on, he came to know that
Gopal Tudu died in the hospital. During re-examination, he stated when the BSF personnel came to
purchase Gutka and Cigarette from his shop at that time he was not having any weapon. He replied
to the questions asked by the Court that he is not aware who fired the weapon as he immediately ran
away from the place of occurrence. The Jawan who purchased Cigarette and Gutka did not pay any
amount. Generally, BSF Jawans made payment immediately after they purchased any goods from
his shop.
During cross-examination, he stated no hot argument took place between him and the Jawan. He
purchased cigarette and Gutka from his shop as such prosecution failed to prove the allegation that
he was arguing and hot altercation taking place with the shop owner.
26. P.W. 14, No. 86005119 Head Constable Tarsem Lal, 'A' Coy, 140 Bn BSF is injured witness. He
deposed that on 1st December, 2010 at about 18.20 hours he was present at BOP Satimari at that
time Coy Comdr. told him that Ct. Sanjib Kr. Roy reported that petitioner had taken liquor and was
standing at civilian's shop in the village Chandipur. After that, Coy Comdr. asked him to get ready
with the vehicle to move towards the civilian's shop at Chandipur to bring the petitioner. Within 5 to
10 minutes, he along with Coy Comdr. and Ct./DVr. Gulam Mohammad left for the civilian's shop in
Maruti Gypsy. They reached at the civilian's shop within 3 to 4 minutes. He saw petitioner standing
in front of the shop of civilian. On reaching near the petitioner, Coy Comdr. enquired about the shop
keeper as to what was the matter. Shop keeper replied that petitioner purchased some items today
and earlier also and he had made all the payments and still he is not leaving the shop. Since it was
his business hours so petitioner should leave the shop immediately. He further deposed that on the
date of accident the Coy Commander asked the petitioner to move away from the shop and went to
BOP but petitioner did not move from that place as such immediately Coy Commander informed the
Unit Adjutant, who asked to Coy Commander to pursue the petitioner. After that, petitioner went
towards the place where Gypsy was parked i.e. towards other side of the road at that time he was
having his weapon on his shoulder and suddenly shouted "Madarchodo, tumne meri report to de hi
di hai, mai tum logo ko nahi chorta" and petitioner cooked his Rifle. On seeing this, he told
Petitioner, "Oye Vijay Prakash Kya Marega Kisi ko." Immediately, soon thereafter that petitioner
started firing. When firing started, he tried to take cover in nearby small ditch. At that time, one
bullet hit him on his right hand by which he was holding a torch. He led down in ditch to save his
life. Bullet hit him on his right hand and his torch fell down. He did not know as to where the Coy
Commander and other civilians ran away. But petitioner continued to fire for 02-03 minutes. When
he was lying down in the ditch, he heard accused was saying, "Maine jo karna tha kar diya abhi tum
log dekh lena." After sometimes fire stopped and Petitioner kept on roaming there for about 05
minutes and after that moved towards the BOP side with his cycle. When he saw the petitioner
moving towards BOP, he asked Ct/Dvr Gulam Mohammad opened the door of Maruti Gypsy. He
told him to stop and took him in Gypsy since he was hit by the bullet in the firing. Ct/Dvr Gulam
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59752143/ 17Ex. Ct. Vijay Prakash vs Union Of India And Ors on 12 February, 2024
Mohammad took him towards the border in Maruti Gypsy i.e. towards opposite direction of the BOP
Satimari because they were apprehending danger since petitioner went towards BOP side with his
weapon. After leaving the place of occurrence, they stopped at OP point for a while and he informed
the Commandant, 140 Bn BSF on the mobile of Ct/DVr Gulam Mohammad about the incident and
he also told him that he got injured by the bullet. He ordered him to move towards the nearby
hospital or to any nearby BSF camp. Then he told him that he cannot move towards BOP Satimari
because petitioner may again attack on him.
During cross-examination, he narrated that he cannot say that it was aimed fired but as soon as he
cocked his rifle, he told the word "Oye Vijay Prakash Kya Marega Kisi ko." He could not say how
bullet hit him in the right hand because at that time he was running to save his life.
It transpires from his evidence that the petitioner started firing but he cannot say whether it was
aimed fired or not. He sustained injury while he was saving himself. It is admitted fact that he told
the petitioner by saying "Oye Vijay Prakash Kya Marega Kisi ko."
27. P.W. 18, Shri Abdul Sadiq, another civilian eye witness, who stated that on 1st December, 2010
at about 18.30 hours he went to the provisional shop of Jogai Sarkar in his village. There he saw one
BSF Jawan already standing there and asked for Gutka from shop keeper. In the meantime, one BSF
vehicle came there and Coy Comdr, G Wala and driver got down from the vehicle and came towards
the shop. He saw one civilian and two BSF persons engaged themselves in hot argument. Suddenly
he heard sound of firing of one round. At the same time, he turned towards them and saw that they
were scuffling. After scuffling, again firing took place. After the firing, Coy Comdr asked all of us to
go away from the place of occurrence. Approx 10 to 12 rounds were fired and he ran away from the
place of occurrence. During night, he came to know that one boy, namely, Gopal Tudu from village
Chandipur and one BSF person sustained bullet injuries in that firing. On the next morning, he
came to know from the civilians that injured Gopal Tudu died in Hospital at Siliguri.
During cross-examination, he stated that no argument was going on between the shopkeeper and
BSF person when he reached there and the BSF person who was present before the civilian shop was
without weapon. Weapon was kept in cycle which was parked in front of the shop across the road.
BSF person who was standing in front of the shop purchased something from the shop was behaving
normally and talking in normal way. He further stated three persons got down from Gypsy. Out of
them one was wearing civil dress and two were in uniform. The civilian who was scuffling with the
petitioner was G Wala (P.W. 14). When BSF persons were scuffling at that time the Coy Comdr. was
standing in the shop. He further stated the firing was not done in aimed position but it was fired
downward. He did not see anybody firing aiming towards any person. Thereafter, he ran away from
the place after firing of three rounds. When the firing was going on he ran away from the place of
occurrence towards the direction i.e. behind the shop along with two other civilians namely,
Hidaitulla and Anarul.
Upon careful consideration of his evidence, he specifically stated no argument was going on between
the shopkeeper and BSF person (petitioner herein) when he reached there and the BSF person who
was present before the civilian shop was without weapon. Weapon was kept in cycle which was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59752143/ 18Ex. Ct. Vijay Prakash vs Union Of India And Ors on 12 February, 2024
parked in front of the shop across the road. BSF person who was standing in front of the shop
purchased something from the shop was behaving normally and talking in normal way. He further
narrated that there was scuffling between the Petitioner and G Wala (P.W. 14) and the firing was not
aimed towards anyone. All the aforesaid oral evidence of eye witnesses clearly proves no
altercation/argument was held between the Petitioner and shop owner. At the same time, his
behaviour was normal and talking in normal way. This behaviour would not be said the petitioner
was under influence of liquor. The allegation of the prosecution is that petitioner was under
influence of liquor and was engaged in altercation with shop owner is absolutely false and washed
out by the independent eye witnesses i.e. P.Ws. 9 and 18. No sufficient or reliable evidence or
corroboration brought on the record with regard to the allegation that he was in drunken condition
or he was in intoxicated condition and was mis-behaving anyone on the date of accident. What
transpires from the evidence that some sudden scuffle took place between G Wala (P.W. 14) and the
petitioner but actual reason cannot be revealed but it reveals during scuffle P.W. 14 insisted him by
saying "Oye Vijay Prakash Kya Marega Kisi ko." It tantamount to some extent provocation from the
side of P.W. 14 resulted in firing by the petitioner. It is admitted facts that one civilian boy died and
HC (G) sustained injury in his right hand. The Petitioner was a BSF jawan. He was in service for
more than 17 years, he should have known the consequence of firing. Due to his firing, one civilian
boy died and P.W. 14 also sustained bullet injury in his right hand. It cannot be denied more
casualties might have been occurred due to such firing but other persons, who were present near the
place of occurrence any how they escaped narrowly. But it cannot also deny that there was no
previous enmity with BSF personnel's or any civilian. Firing took place suddenly due to sudden
argument and scuffle took place between the petitioner and P.W. 14 and the firing was not aimed
fired but it was fired downward. So, there was no intention to kill anyone.
28. P.W. 15, No. 94403510 Constable/DVr Gulam Mohammad. MT Pl. 140 Bn BSF stated on 1st
December, 2010 at about 18.30 hours Coy Comdr along with HC (G) Tarsem Lal came and asked
him to move towards boarder side. While they were going towards boarder, Coy Comdr asked him to
stop vehicle near civilian shop in front of school. When they reached there, Coy Comdr and HC (G)
got down from the vehicle. At that time, he saw the petitioner was engaged in arguing with the shop
keeper and 2 to 3 civilians were also present in the shop. Coy Comdr and HC (G) moved towards
him and he got down from Gypsy and moved towards opposite direction of the shop for nature's call.
While he was answering nature's call at that time, he found petitioner started indiscriminately
firing. He laid down the said place and after sometimes he heard HC (G) screaming saying "Mai Mar
Gaya, Mai mar gaya, Mujhe goli lagi hai". He noticed one bullet hit entry mark on the bonnet of
co-driver seat side of the Gypsy and further exit point of the same in the front side of the bonnet.
Immediately after the firing, he did not see the Coy Comdr at the place of occurrence. In the next
morning, he came to know that a civilian was also injured in the firing.
However, during cross-examination he stated he saw hot argument going on between shop keeper
and the petitioner but he did not find mentioned in the COI, he seems his statement was not
recorded properly. He saw petitioner firing when he was standing under the Banyan tree. At that
time, HC (G) was standing in front of the shop. At that time, 2 to 3 civilians were also present at the
shop but no female was present there. He saw only petitioner firing towards the shop continuously.
He further stated that the distance between the shop and the Maruti Gypsy was about 10 to 15 yards
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59752143/ 19Ex. Ct. Vijay Prakash vs Union Of India And Ors on 12 February, 2024
as such he able to hear the argument going on between petitioner and the shop keeper.
From his entire evidence, it transpires that he heard argument between shop keeper and the
petitioner. However, shop keeper (P.W.9) denied about any argument or hot altercation with the
petitioner. P.W. 15 narrated about the indiscriminately firing by the petitioner and HC (G) suffered
bullet injury on his person and heard HC (G) screaming saying "Mai Mar Gaya, Mai mar gaya,
Mujhe goli lagi hai".
29. P.W. 3 Inspr. Md Yakub stated Constable Sanjeev Kumar Rai reported him that after returning
from Op duty the Petitioner has taken liquor and arguing with the Civilian shopkeeper, Jogai Sarkar.
On hearing, he went towards the shop along with HC Tarsem Lal and Constable Gulam Mohd in
Maruti Gypsy. When they reached at the shop of Civilian, he saw the Petitioner was making
arguments with the shopkeeper. He immediately reported the matter to the Unit Adjutant on mobile
phone. He told him to take the Petitioner to the camp by anyhow as such he told the Petitioner to
accompany him to camp. At that time civilian shop keeper also told the Petitioner to go away from
the shop. He further stated that the shopkeeper said that the petitioner had already made the
payment but still he did not move. The civilian shopkeeper told him that he did not care for the
order of Coy Comdr as well as HC (G). The petitioner move towards his bicycle parked on the other
side of the road near tree. From there he said "Madarchodo, tumne meri report to de hi di hai, mai
tum logo ko nahi chorta" Immediately he cocked his rifle and started firing on them.
During cross he stated he had lodge an FIR on 02.12.2010. In the Police station he came to know
that one FIR had already been lodged in this case by the civilians. He got minor injuries due to
manhandling by the civilians but no medical examination was conducted.
30. P.Ws. 16 and 17 are the mother and father of deceased Gopal Tudu. They stated they heard from
a villager that her son had got bullet injury and he was lying in front of provisional shop of Jogai
Sarkar near school. Immediately, they rushed to the place of occurrence. On reaching there, saw one
BSF vehicle was standing and two personnel were present there. Upon enquiry, they both started the
vehicle and left the place of occurrence without answering their query. Their son received two bullet
injuries on the right side of the stomach. P.W. 16 kept on sitting near her injured son for about one
and half hour. In between number of civilians came there but nobody attended her son. Two Police
vehicles came there and they removed their son to the Hospital. He was removed to Raiganj and
from there to Siliguri. On the next day, it was informed Gopal Tudu died in Hospital. Same day in
the evening they received dead body and last rites were performed.
P.W. 17, de facto-complainant also stated no BSF personnel reached there and when he went to the
police station at that time Coy Comdr, BOP Satimari was also present there. Coy Comdr wrote
something on paper and asked him to sign it since he was an illiterate. He lodged the FIR which was
written in Bengali after putting signature in Bengali before the Kushmandi P.S. same was registered
as Kushmandi P.S. GDE No. 85 dated 02.12.2010, corresponding to Kushmandi P.S. Case No.
106/10 dated 02.12.2010 under Section 302 IPC.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59752143/ 20Ex. Ct. Vijay Prakash vs Union Of India And Ors on 12 February, 2024
31. P.W. 19 Shri Munsa Tudu is another co-villager. At the time of occurrence, he was in his house.
Suddenly, he heard the sound of continuous firing. A villager came to his house and told him that
Gopal Tudu had sustained bullet injuries in the firing incident which took place near the shop.
When he reached at the shop of Jogai Sarkar, he saw Gopal Tudu was lying there in injured

who is sitting in the Court. At about 21.00 hrs, he reached at BOP Satimari and there he met Offg
Coy Comdr Inspector Md. Yaqub. At that time, he observed that some blood was coming out from
his lips and nose. Then Offg Coy Comdr narrated him the incident and also told him that petitioner
did not report back in the BOP after completion of his duty and later on when he went there to bring
him from the shop at that time some hot argument took place between them and petitioner fired on
him. Till then petitioner did not report back in the camp after the incident and search parties were
already out to search him. The weapon of the petitioner was recovered and deposited in the Coy
Kote. In the mean time, at about 23.00 hrs, it struck in his mind that petitioner can be contacted on
his mobile. Then he asked about the mobile number of the petitioner. One constable namely, Somraj
was having his mobile number and through his mobile he tried to contact the petitioner and he
succeeded in contacting the petitioner at about 23.45 hrs. After his great persuasion, petitioner got
ready to disclose his location where he was hiding himself. Then he took his vehicle along with
guards and reached the place where petitioner was hiding himself, which was just 200 yards away
from the place of occurrence. When vehicle reached there, he himself came near the vehicle and sit
down in the vehicle. At that time, he was bare handed. Then he informed the Commandant and he
ordered him not to bring the petitioner to BOP Satimari and took him directly to Bn HQ and put

37. P. W. 4 HC Praveen Kumar stated he was the Guard Commander and also Kote Commander of
BOP Satimari. The petitioner deputed for duty at OP 2 was issued with INSAS Butt No. 584, Body

2010 at about 10.50 pm one patient namely, Gopal Tudu resident of village Chandipur, PS

42. P.W. 10 SI Santanu Mukherjee (1st IO) of West Bengal Police was first to reach the PO at Vill-
Chandipur on 01 Dec 2010 evening where petitioner has resorted to the fire indiscriminately and
later absconded. He carried out the investigation and specified the civilian who came there as the
area was tensed due to firing resorted by the petitioner and absconded and due to which civilian
namely, Gopal Tudu sustained injuries at his abdomen and he was removed to PHC Kushmandi. He
also stated about the argument/quarrel of petitioner with the shop owner Jogai Sarkar and
petitioner's intoxication condition before crime as learnt on 1st December, 2010. The IO visited the
BOP Satimari same day after the incident and endorsed his entry in the Arms issue register where
Butt No. 584 issued to the petitioner for the duty and he has not deposited the same after his duty
timing and he resorted to fire one full magazine i.e. 20 rds. Weapon butt no. 584 along with 3
magazine and 40 rds recovered by Constable Addya Prasad was also seized and handed over to Kote
NCO in the presence of Coy Commander and later he shield it on 2nd December, 2010 and further
handed over to BSF. He lodged the FIR U/S 302 on written complaint lodged by Shri John Tudu
whose adopted son Gopal Tudu sustained injuries due to petitioner's firing. On subsequent inquiry
as well as written application given by Inspr Md Yakub charges U/S 307 IPC were also framed on
this additional FIR since HC (G) Tarsem Lal was also injured and fire was also delivered on Inspr
Md Yakub on 1st Dec 2010 at about 1845 hrs and later he posted out from P.S. and could not
complete the case.
43. P.W. 11, 2nd IO stated he carried out the left-out inquiry and file the charge sheet in Court, in
which the petitioner No. 94106242 Constable Vijay Prakash of 140 Bn BSF was found prima facie
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59752143/ 24Ex. Ct. Vijay Prakash vs Union Of India And Ors on 12 February, 2024
case U/S 302 established and Section 307 IPC and throughout petitioner was on custody of BSF and
as requisition case was transferred to BSF for its trial.
44. P.W. 12 Ct Somraj stated he found petitioner No. 94106242 Constable Vijay Prakash normal at
changeover of duty and petitioner was carrying his weapon at the time of leaving spot in his cycle.
45. P.W. 13, HC Pradeep Kumar Mishra deposed petitioner No. 94106242 Constable Vijay Prakash
was found normal at the time of closing of fence gate. He despatched troops to ascertain cause of
firing at about 011900 hrs and let to recovery of weapon INSAS Butt No. 584 along with 40 Rds with
two filled magazine and one empty magazine dumped by petitioner who has absconded after
committing the heinous crime with deliberate intention to kill Inspr. Mohd. Yakub, HC (G) Tarsem
Lal and others. It is learnt on arrival of Offg Coy Commander at his BOP. The petitioner was
absconding and not returns to BOP. He was traced at about 23.45 hrs after committing the crime.
He subsequently learnt injuries sustained to Gopal Tudu S/O John Tudu Village Chandipur who was
removed by civilians of village and also injuries to HC Tarsem Lal who has escaped this heavy
volume of fire by the petitioner and further removed from the spot by Constable/DVr Gulam Mohd.
Police as well as Officers from nearby Coy and Bn HQ also reached the spot and started search of the
area to trace petitioner Constable Vijay Prakash who was absconding.
46. Upon perusal of entire evidence and case of the Prosecution, it reveals the allegation of the
prosecution that the petitioner created a scene in the spot under influence of liquor. He had engaged
an altercation with the shop owner (P.W. 9) in intoxication condition but no such facts proved by
the prosecution witnesses by cogent and/or reliable evidence. Prosecution miserably failed to prove
that there was hot argument or an altercation between the shop owner and the BSF Jawan i.e.
Petitioner herein. Public witness i.e. P.W. 18 specifically deposed that there was no altercation with
the shop owner. Even P.W. 9, shop owner himself flatly refused that any disturbance or altercation
took place between them. P.W. 18 further stated the BSF person who was present before the civilian
shop was without weapon. Weapon was kept in cycle which was parked in front of the shop across
the road. Petitioner, who was standing in front of the shop purchased something from the shop was
behaving normally and talking in normal way. Rather he narrated that there was scuffling between
the Petitioner and G Wala (P.W. 14) and the firing was not aimed towards anyone but it was fired
downward. All the aforesaid oral evidence of eye witnesses clearly proves no altercation was held
between the Petitioner and shop owner. At the same time, his behaviour was normal and talking in
normal way. This behaviour could not be said under influence of liquor. The allegation of the
prosecution is that petitioner was under influence of liquor and was engaged in altercation with
shop owner is absolutely oblitrated by the vital eye witnesses i.e. P.Ws. 9 and 18. All these vital facts
and evidence have not been considered by the Learned GSF Court while marshalling and
appreciation of evidence. It is also not considered why such incident of firing took place at the place
of occurrence. The Learned GSF Court finally came to conclusion that he is found guilty under
Section 46 of the Boarder Security Force Act, 1968 that is to say for murder and attempt to murder
punishable under Sections 302 and 307 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced him "To
Suffer Life imprisonment and to be dismissed from service". At the same time, Appellate Authority
dismissed his application without affording opportunity of being heard to the petitioner on earlier
occasion as well as second time by the DG, BSF despite of giving opportunity by this High Court vide
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59752143/ 25Ex. Ct. Vijay Prakash vs Union Of India And Ors on 12 February, 2024
order dated 05.10.2021 to dispose of application for suspension of sentence or set aside the
judgment and order dated 17.04.2012 on merits. The DG, BSF surreptitiously jumped and decided
the case without sufficient reasoning and without affording opportunity of hearing to the Petitioner.
He grossly violated the principle of natural justice and infringed rights of hearing to the Petitioner.
It is apparent from the face of record that there is insufficient evidence to support the allegation of
the prosecution and thereby findings of the learned GSF Court ought to have been considered by the
Appellate Authority under Section 117 of the BSF Act, 1968 but miserably failed. It further reveals
there is patent defect and error of law while considering application of the petitioner filed under
Section 117 of the BSF Act, 1968 on the part of Appellate Authority. There is no other alternative
efficacious remedy for his grievances as prayed for under the BSF Act, 1968 after rejection by the
DG, BSF as such this Court can exercise power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to
secure the end of justice. Therefore, these writ petitions are maintainable.
Judgment relied on behalf of the petitioner is well acceptable. The Hon'ble Delhi High Court held in
paragraph 10 of the said judgment reported in Ram Prasad Saini Vs UOI and Anr9 as under: -
2012 SCC Online Del 5160 "10. It is trite that a challenge to proceedings of the
Boarder Security Force Court would lie if there was no evidence at all to support the
findings; or if the GSFC failed to comply with the prescribed procedure or on account
of violation with the principles of natural justice in the conduct of the proceedings"
47. The prosecution has been able to prove that P.W. 14 sustained injuries in his right
hand. P.W. 14 and P.W. 15 specifically deposed injury suffered by P.W.14 is due to
bullet injury. P.W. 21, Dr. Mrs. Neela Bhattacharya, M.S., MCH (Plastic Surgeon) of
Anandlok Hospital, Siliguri has corroborated that she attended him and stated he
was referred to Anandlok Hospital, Siliguri from Composite Hospital, BSF,
Kadamtala for blow-out injury of dorsum of the right hand. On 4th December, 2010
the wound debridement was done along with fixation of fractures on mid finger and
index finger. She also repaired the extensor tendons. Resurfacing has been done with
superiorly based abdominal flap on 7th December, 2010. The patient remains
admitted till 13th December, 2010. She further stated when patient came to her on
3rd December, 2010 the case history shows that he got bullet injury on 1st December,
2010. Discharge summary of Tarsem Lal marked as Exhibit W-1.
There is no dispute about the death of a civilian person, namely, Gopal Tudu due to
bullet injury suffered by him as most of the witnesses proved that the Petitioner
started firing and during such firing Gopal Tudu sustained bullet injury on his
person. P.M. report and information of cause of death from the hospital marked
Exhibit Nos. 'F' and 'F1' also supported the same.
48. From meticulously perusal of entire evidence, this Court does not repose
confidence about the version of prosecution that the petitioner engaged in argument
or altercation with the shop owner under the influence of liquor on the following
reasons: Firstly, story of argument or altercation with the shop owner under the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59752143/ 26Ex. Ct. Vijay Prakash vs Union Of India And Ors on 12 February, 2024
influence of liquor is not proved by the prosecution with cogent or reliable evidence.
There was no reflection either in the FIR lodged by John Tudu on 02.12.2010 marked
as 'V' and 'V1' or evidence of the witnesses. P.W. 18 clearly denied the version of
prosecution by saying that there was no altercation with the shop owner. Even P.W.
9, shop owner himself flatly refused that any disturbance or altercation took place
between them. P.W. 18 blots out the case of prosecution by saying BSF person who
was standing in front of the shop purchased something from the shop was behaving
normally and talking in normal way.
Secondly, no justified or reliable evidence transpires from the version of the
prosecution witnesses that petitioner was under the influence of liquor or petitioner
had consumed liquor at the place of occurrence or in between the way of BOP
Satimari to shop situated at village Chandipur, P.S. Kushmandi, District- Dakshin
Dinajpur or OP point because P.W. 12, Ct. Somraj and P.W. 13, H.C. Pradeep Kr.
Mishra deposed petitioner was normal at changeover of duty and/or at the time of
closing of fencing gate.
49. In view of entire evidence adduced by the prosecution witnesses, on the other
side, it reveals there was quarrel or scuffle actually taken place between the petitioner
and BSF personnel particularly P.W. 14 at the place of occurrence just prior to the
incident but reason is unknown to anyone. Prosecution or defence also fails to prove
the same. Consequently, contentions of prosecution itself proved beyond reasonable
doubt that the petitioner had no intention or pre-meditation to murder or assault
anybody else.
50. Undoubtedly, prosecution has established beyond reasonable doubt that one BSF
personnel, P.W. 14 suffered bullet injury on his right hand and civilian boy namely,
Gopal Tudu died due to suffering from bullet injury on 02.12.2010. Autopsy Doctor
opined that deceased died due to shock and haemorrhage which were ante mortem
and homicidal in nature.
Petitioner, Ex ct. Vijay Praksh also stated categorically in his examination under
Section 313 of the Cr.P.C. read with BSF Rule 93 (2) that he did not fire on any
civilian namely, Gopal Tudu and tried to kill any person in fact HC (G) Tarsem Lal
and Ct/Driver Gulam Mohammad tried to snatch his rifle from him and he did not
know how the firing took place during scuffle. However, one civilian boy died due to
injury suffered by the bullets.
51. In the light of above discussions and analysis of evidence, it cannot be ruled out
that sudden quarrel/scuffle took place between the Petitioner and HC (G) Tarsem
Lal. BSF personnel went towards the shop of Jogai Sarkar and invited or picked up
quarrel with him but actual reason is not known. Thus, it can be safely accepted it
was sudden quarrel or scuffle took place at the place of occurrence and in a fit of
passion and without any pre-planned/pre-meditation, Petitioner started firing on the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59752143/ 27Ex. Ct. Vijay Prakash vs Union Of India And Ors on 12 February, 2024
instigation of P.W. 14 by saying "Oye Vijay Prakash Kya Marega Kisi ko."
It is definitely a challenge offer or provocation to petitioner, which may prompt him to fire but, in
my opinion, Exception I of Section 300 IPC is not applicable in this case. The Exception 1 of Section
300 IPC deals with homicide committed in the heat of passion or way of sudden provocation. The
test of grave and sudden provocation is whether a reasonable man belonging to the same class of
society as the petitioner, placed in the situation in which the petitioner was placed would be so
provoked as to lose self-control.
In determining the question of provocation, the objective test as was applied by the Privy Council in
Philips vs. R [(1969) 2 AC 130:
(1969) 2 WLR 581] must be applied. The two questions which require affirmative
answers are as follows:
(1) Would a reasonable man have lost his self-control? (2) Would he then have
retaliated as the offender did?
In the present case, the firing cannot be said to be the result of grave and sudden provocation
because petitioner was in BSF for more than 17 years at the time of incident and he knows the
consequence of firing by INSAS Rifle.
On the contrary, this appears to be a case as noted above, covered by Exception 4 to Section 300
IPC. Four requirements are to be satisfied to bring in application of Exception 4. Those are as under:
(1) It was a sudden fight;
(2) There was no premeditation;
(3) The Act was in a heat of passion; and (4) The assailant had not taken any undue
advantage or acted in a cruel manner.
The cause of quarrel is not relevant nor is it relevant that offered the provocation or started the fight.
The factual scenario as appears from entire evidence goes to show that in course of sudden
quarrel/altercation, the petitioner fired the shots without target. It reveals from the evidence of P.W.
14 injured person, who deposed that he cannot say whether it was aimed fire or not though he was a
BSF personnel.
P.W. 18 public witness also stated he did not see anybody firing aiming towards any person.
During cross-examination, he specifically stated the firing was not in aimed position but it was fired
downward.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59752143/ 28Ex. Ct. Vijay Prakash vs Union Of India And Ors on 12 February, 2024
Therefore, in fact, Exception 4 to Section 300 applied in the instant case. I, therefore, alter the
conviction to Section 304 Part II of Indian Penal Code read with Section 46 of BSF Act, 1968 instead
of Section 302 IPC and under Section 308 part II from the Section 307 of the IPC read with Section
46 of BSF Act, 1968.
In this regard, we should not forget several judgments passed by the Hon'ble Apex Court, on the
similar circumstances, which can be relied upon. Those judgments are indicated herein below:
In Surinder Kumar v. Union Territory, Chandigarh10 Hon'ble Supreme Court held:
"To invoke this exception four requirements must be satisfied, namely,
(i) it was a sudden fight; (ii) there was no premeditation; (iii) the act was done in a
heat of passion; and (iv) the assailant had not taken any undue advantage or acted in
a cruel manner. The cause of the quarrel is not relevant nor is it relevant who offered
the provocation or started the assault. The number of wounds caused during the
occurrence is not a decisive factor but what is important is that the occurrence must
have been sudden and unpremeditated and the offender must have acted in a fit of
anger. Of course, offender must not have taken any undue advantage or acted in a
cruel manner. Where, (1989) 2 SCC 217 on a sudden quarrel, a person in the heat of
the moment picks up a weapon which is handy and causes injuries, one of which
proves fatal, he would be entitled to the benefit of this exception provided he has not
acted cruelly......." (Emphasis supplied) In Dhirajbhai Gorakhbhai Nayak v. State of
Gujarat11 the Hon'ble Supreme Court while discussing the ingredients of Exception 4
of Section 300 IPC, held:
"The fourth exception of Section 300 IPC covers acts done in a sudden fight. The said
Exception deals with a case of prosecution (sic provocation) not covered by the first
exception, after which its place would have been more appropriate. The Exception is
founded upon the same principle, for in both there is absence of premeditation. But,
while in the case of Exception 1 there is total deprivation of self−control, in case of
Exception 4, there is only that heat of passion which clouds men's sober reason and
urges them to deeds which they would not otherwise do. There is provocation in
Exception 4 as in Exception 1, but the injury done is not the direct consequence of
that provocation. In fact, Exception 4 deals with cases in which notwithstanding that
a blow may have been struck, or some provocation given in the origin of the dispute
or in whatever way the quarrel may have originated, yet the subsequent conduct of
both parties puts them in respect of guilt upon an equal footing. A "sudden fight"
implies mutual provocation and blows on each side. The homicide committed is then
clearly not (2003) 9 SCC 322 traceable to unilateral provocation, nor could in such
cases the whole blame be placed on one side. For if it were so, the Exception more
appropriately applicable would-be Exception 1. There is no previous deliberation or
determination to fight. A fight suddenly takes place, for which both parties are more
or less to be blamed. It may be that one of them starts it, but if the other had not

aggravated it by his own conduct it would not have taken the serious turn it did.
There is then mutual provocation and aggravation, and it is difficult to apportion the
share of blame which attaches to each fighter. The help of Exception 4 can be invoked
if death is caused (a) without premeditation, (b) in a sudden fight, (c) without the
offenders having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner, and
(d) the fight must have been with the person killed. To bring a case within Exception
4 all the ingredients mentioned in it must be found. It is to be noted that the "fight"
occurring in Exception 4 to Section 300 IPC is not defined in IPC. It takes two to make a fight. Heat
of passion requires that there must be no time for the passions to cool down and in this case, the
parties had worked themselves into a fury on account of the verbal altercation in the beginning. A
fight is a combat between two and more persons whether with or without weapons. It is not possible
to enunciate any general rule as to what shall be deemed to be a sudden quarrel. It is a question of
fact and whether a quarrel is sudden or not must necessarily depend upon the proved facts of each
case. For the application of Exception 4, it is not sufficient to show that there was a sudden quarrel
and there was no premeditation. It must further be shown that the offender has not taken undue
advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. The expression "undue advantage" as used in the
provision means "unfair advantage"."
The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of K. Ravi Kumar vs. State of Karnataka12 held:
"9. Before we turn to the facts of this case, it is apposite to take note of the principle
of law laid down by this Court as to in which circumstances, the accused is held
entitled to claim the benefit of Exception 4 to Section 300 IPC thereby is entitled to
seek conversion of the offence committed by him from murder to culpable homicide
not amounting to murder. Indeed, the principle of law on this issue remains no
longer res integra and settled by a series of decisions of this Court. What has varied is
its application to every case.
10. Exception 4 to Section 300 reads as under:
"300. Murder - Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is
murder, if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing
death, or Exception 4: Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without
premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and
without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual
manner. Explanation - It is immaterial in such cases which partly offers the
provocation or commits the first assault."
(2015) 2 SCC 638 The judgement relied by the petitioner passed in Sukhdev Singh V. Delhi State
(Govt. of NCT of Delhi)13 is also applicable. In the said case the accused/appellant had an
altercation with the deceased and during the course of scuffle the accused fired shot from his pistol
but the bullet missed the target and hit the thigh of another person, who was standing nearby,
sustained injury. The accused/appellant fired again aiming at deceased and eventually deceased

collapsed. The Hon'ble Supreme Court altered the conviction to 304 II and Section 308 IPC from
Section 302 and 307 of the IPC after observing therein that:
"14. In the present the gunshots cannot be said to the result of grave and sudden
provocation
15. on the contrary, this appears to be a case as noted above, covered by Exception 4
to Section 300. Four requirements are to be satisfied to bring in application of
Exception 4. They are as follows:
(1) It was a sudden fight;
(2) There was no premeditation;
(3) The Act was in a heat of passion; and (4) The assailant had not taken any undue
advantage or acted in a cruel manner.
(2003) 7 SCC 441
16. The cause of quarrel is not relevant nor is it relevant who offered the provocation
or started the fight. "
(Emphasis supplied)
52. Keeping in view of the decisions of the Apex Court, this Court also inclined to give benefit of
Exception 4 to Section 300 IPC to the petitioner by altering his Conviction and Sentence awarded by
the Learned GSF Court under Section 304 Part II IPC and Section 308 part II instead of Section 302
and 307 of IPC read with 46 of BSF Act, 1968 on the following reasons: -
1. There was no pre-meditation or intention for commission of offence causing
murder or attempt to murder by the petitioner.
2. Incident was occurred on 01.12.2010, when BSF personnel came to the shop of
Jogai Sarkar and started inquiry about the petitioner and ensued sudden
quarrel/scuffle between the petitioner and H.C (G) P.W. 14 resulting firing took
place.
3. It is well-established by P.Ws. 9 and 18 that there was no argument/hot altercation
taken place between the petitioner and the shop owner, Jogai Sarkar under the
influence of liquor. He was behaving normally and talking in normal way.
4. No conclusive evidence was adduced by the prosecution to prove any kind of
enmity amongst the shop owner, civilian boy or BSF personnel with the Petitioner
prior to the incident. The Act was in a heat of passion.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/59752143/ 31Ex. Ct. Vijay Prakash vs Union Of India And Ors on 12 February, 2024
5. Due to sudden quarrel and altercation between the Petitioner and P.W. 14 and in
addition, P.W. 14 uttered by saying "Oye Vijay Prakash Kya Marega Kisi ko." resulted
in firing took place and finally caused death of a civilian boy, who was standing near
the shop and P.W.14 sustained injury though the target of firing was not in aimed
position but it was fired downward. The Petitioner being BSF Jawan, experience in
firing had not taken any undue advantage or acted in a cruel manner.
53. Therefore, I am of the considered view that aforesaid reasons are sufficient to give
benefit of Exception 4 to Section 300 IPC to the petitioner and enables this Court to
hold that the offence in question was not murder but it was an offence of culpable
homicide not amounting to murder as specified in Exception 4 to Section 300 and
hence, petitioner is punishable under Section 304 Part II IPC and Section 308 part II
instead of Sections 302/307 of the Indian Penal Code read with Section 46 of BSF
Act, 1968.
FINAL RESULT:
54. In the result, writ petitions being WPA 31234 of 2017 and WPA 15518 of 2022 are
allowed in part. Accordingly, the conviction and sentenced is alter by directing to
undergo sentence of 10 years for an offence punishable under Section 304 Part II and
Sentence to imprisonment for 7 years for an offence punishable under Section 308
part II of the Indian Penal Code read with Section 46 of the BSF Act, 1968. Both
sentences run concurrently. Sentence towards dismissal from service shall remain
unaltered.
55. Consequently, both writ petitions are, thus, disposed of with above observations
and pending applications, if any, are also disposed of.
56. As the petitioner already suffered more than 11 years' imprisonment would suffice
the sentenced imposed by this Court.
Accordingly, Petitioner shall be set at liberty forthwith if he is not wanted in any other case, upon
execution of a bond to the satisfaction of the Learned GSF Court which shall remain in force to
appear before the Appellate Court or Higher Court as and when such Court issues notice in respect
of appeal or petition filed against the judgment and order of this Court. Fine amount, if any, not
paid, be recovered in accordance with law.
