(Arising out of S.L.P. (C.) No. 16320 of 2018)
GARG BUILDERS …APPELLANT(S)
VERSUS
BHARAT HEAVY ELECTRICALS LIMITED …RESPONDENT(S)
JUDGMENT
S. ABDUL NAZEER, J.
Leave granted.
2. This appeal is directed against the Order of the Division Bench of the High Court of Delhi dated
19.09.2017 in FAO(OS) (COMM)No.120/2017 whereby it has upheld the judgment of the learned
Single Judge in OMP (COMM) No.28 of 2017 dated Signature Not Verified 10.03.2017, resulting in
denial of pendente lite interest on the Digitally signed by Anita Malhotra Date: 2021.10.04 16:45:27
IST Reason:
award amount to the appellant.
3. The respondent floated a tender for construction of boundary wall at its 2x750 MW Pragati III
Combined Cycle Power at Bawana, Delhi (hereinafter referred to as ‘the project’). The appellant
submitted its bid for the project which was accepted by the respondent. Pursuant to which, the
respondent issued a Letter of Intent (LOI) to the appellant dated 09.09.2008. Subsequently, on
24.10.2008 the parties entered into a contract which, inter alia, contained the interest barring clause
which is reproduced hereunder:
“Clause 17: No interest shall be payable by BHEL on Earnest Money Deposit, Security
Deposit or on any moneys due to the contractor.”
4. The disputes arose between the parties with respect to the aforesaid contract and subsequently
the appellant filed a petition under Section 11 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31220675/ 1Garg Builders vs Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited on 4 October, 2021
short, “the 1996 Act”) before the Delhi High Court wherein the Court vide Order dated 16.09.2011
appointed Hon’ble Mr. Justice M.A. Khan (Retd.) as the sole Arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes.
The appellant in the claim petition, apart from claiming various amounts under different heads,
inter alia claimed pre−reference, pendente lite and future interest at the rate of 24% on the value of
the award. Learned Arbitrator after hearing the contentions of both the parties concluded that there
is no prohibition in the contract dated 24.10.2008 and LOI dated 09.09.2010 about payment of
interest for the pre−suit, pendente lite and future period. Therefore, he awarded pendente lite and
future interest at the rate of 10% p.a. to the appellant on the award amount from the date of filing of
the claim petition i.e. 02.12.2011 till the date of realization of the award amount.
5. The respondent challenged the said award under Section 34 of the 1996 Act before the Delhi High
Court in O.M.P. (COMM.) 28/2017 on various grounds, inter alia, on the ground that the learned
Arbitrator being creature of the arbitration agreement travelled beyond the terms of the contract in
awarding pendente lite interest on the award amount as the same was expressly barred in terms of
the contract. The learned Single Judge vide his final judgment and order dated 10.03.2017 held as
under:
“The Arbitrator fell in error in holding that the aforesaid clause only prescribed pre−
reference interest and not pendente lite interest. As stated earlier, in terms of Section
31(7)(a) of the Act, the power of the arbitral tribunal to award pre award interest is
contingent to the parties not agreeing to the contrary. Pre−award interest includes
both pre− reference interest as well as pendente lite interest. Thus, the conclusion of
the Arbitrator that award of pendente lite interest was not prescribed by clause 17 of
the Agreement is not sustainable.
Accordingly, the impugned award to the extent of award of pendente lite interest is
set aside. The petition is disposed of. No orders as to costs.”
6. As noticed above, the Division Bench of the High Court has upheld the judgment and order of the
Learned Single Judge in the impugned order.
7. On 03.07.2018, this Court issued notice observing as under:
“Learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance on an order of this Court in
Ambica Construction v. Union of India, (2017) 14 SCC 323.”
8. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the materials on record. Mr. Sanjay
Bansal, learned counsel for the appellant, contended that the learned Arbitrator had taken a
plausible view, in terms of the Clause 17 of the Contract and held that the said clause does not bar
the payment of interest for pendente lite period. This argument was advanced in view of judgment of
this Court in Ambica Construction v. Union of India1, wherein the appellant was entitled for the
payment of interest for the pendente lite period. He has also relied on another judgment of this
Court in Raveechee and Company v. Union of India2 in support of his contentions. Further, it was
argued by the learned counsel that the Clause 17 of the Contract barring payment of interest to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/31220675/ 2Garg Builders vs Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited on 4 October, 2021
contractor on any sum due to the contractor, is ultra vires and against the provisions of Section 28
of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.
9. On the other hand, Mr. Pallav Kumar, learned counsel for the respondent, submitted that Section
31(7)(a) of the 1996 Act gives paramount importance to the contract entered into between the
parties and categorically restricts the power of an arbitrator to award pre−reference and pendente
lite interest when the parties themselves have agreed to the contrary. He argued that if the contract
itself contains a specific clause which expressly bars the payment of interest, then it is not open for
the arbitrator to grant pendente lite interest. It was further argued that Ambica 1 (2017) 14 SCC 323
2 (2018) 7 SCC 664 Construction (supra) is not applicable to the instant case because it was decided
under the Arbitration Act, 1940 whereas the instant case falls under the 1996 Act. It was further
argued that Section 3 of the Interest Act confers power on the Court to allow interest in the
proceedings for recovery of any debt or damages or in proceedings in which a claim for interest in
respect of any debt or damages already paid. However, Section 3(3) of the Interest Act carves out an
exception and recognizes the right of the parties to contract out of the payment of interest arising
out of any debt or damages and sanctifies contracts which bars the payment of interest arising out of
debt or damages. Therefore, Clause 17 of the Contract is not violative of any the provisions of the
Indian Contract Act, 1872. In light of the arguments advanced, the learned counsel prays for
dismissal of the appeal.
10. We have carefully considered the submissions of the learned counsel for both the parties made at
the Bar. The law relating to award of pendente lite interest by Arbitrator under the 1996 Act is no
longer res integra. The provisions of the 1996 Act give paramount importance to the contract
entered into between the parties and categorically restricts the power of an arbitrator to award pre−
reference and pendente lite interest when the parties themselves have agreed to the contrary.
Section 31(7)(a) of the 1996 Act which deals with the payment of interest is as under :
“31(7)(a) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, where and insofar as an arbitral
award is for the payment of money, the arbitral tribunal may include in the sum for
which the award is made interest, at such rate as it deems reasonable, on the whole or
any part of the money, for the whole or any part of the period between the date on
which the cause of action arose and the date on which the award is made.”
11. It is clear from the above provision that if the contract prohibits pre−reference and pendente lite
interest, the arbitrator cannot award interest for the said period. In the present case, clause barring
interest is very clear and categorical. It uses the expression “any moneys due to the contractor” by
the employer which includes the amount awarded by the arbitrator.
12. In Sayeed Ahmed and Company v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors.3 this Court has held that a
provision has been made under Section 31(7)(a) of the 1996 Act in relation to the power of the 3
(2009) 12 SCC 26 arbitrator to award interest. As per this section, if the contract bars payment of
interest, the arbitrator cannot award interest from the date of cause of action till the date of award.

13. In Sree Kamatchi Amman Constructions v. Divisional Railway Manager (Works), Palghat & Ors.
4 it was held by this Court that where the parties had agreed that the interest shall not be payable,
the Arbitral Tribunal cannot award interest between the date on which the cause of action arose to
the date of the award.
14. Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited v. Globe Hi−Fabs Limited 5 is an identical case where this
Court has held as under :
“16. In the present case we noticed that the clause barring interest is very widely
worded. It uses the words “any amount due to the contractor by the employer”. In our
opinion, these words cannot be read as ejusdem generis along with the earlier words
“earnest money” or “security deposit”.”
15. In Sri Chittaranjan Maity v. Union of India6 it was categorically held that if a contract prohibits
award of interest for pre−award period, the arbitrator cannot award interest for the said period.
4 (2010) 8 SCC 767 5 (2015) 5 SCC 718 6 (2017) 9 SCC 611
16. Therefore, if the contract contains a specific clause which expressly bars payment of interest,
then it is not open for the arbitrator to grant pendente lite interest. The judgment on which reliance
was placed by the learned counsel for the appellant in Ambica Construction (supra) has no
application to the instant case because Ambica Construction was decided under the Arbitration Act
1940 whereas the instant case falls under the 1996 Act. This has been clarified in Sri Chittaranjan
Maity (supra) as under :
“16. Relying on a decision of this Court in Ambica Construction v. Union of India,
(2017) 14 SCC 323, the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant submits that mere
bar to award interest on the amounts payable under the contract would not be
sufficient to deny payment on pendente lite interest.
Therefore, the arbitrator was justified in awarding the pendente lite interest. However, it is not clear
from Ambica Construction (supra) as to whether it was decided under the Arbitration Act, 1940 (for
short “the 1940 Act”) or under the 1996 Act. It has relied on a judgment of Constitution Bench in
State of Orissa v. G.C. Roy, (1992) 1 SCC 508. This judgment was with reference to the 1940 Act. In
the 1940 Act, there was no provision which prohibited the arbitrator from awarding interest for the
pre− reference, pendente lite or post−award period, whereas the 1996 Act contains a specific
provision which says that if the agreement prohibits award of interest for the pre−award period, the
arbitrator cannot award interest for the said period. Therefore, the decision in Ambica Construction
(supra) cannot be made applicable to the instant case.”
17. The decision in Raveechee and Company (supra) relied on by the learned counsel for the
appellant is again under the Arbitration Act 1940 which has no application to the facts of the present
case.

18. Having regard to the above, we are of the view that the High Court was justified in rejecting the
claim of the appellant seeking pendente lite interest on the award amount.
19. This takes us to the next question as to whether Clause 17 of the Contract is ultra vires in terms of
Section 28 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. According to Section 28, a contract is void to the extent
it restricts absolutely a party from enforcing his rights by usual proceedings in ordinary courts or if
it limits the time within which he may enforce his rights. Exception I to this section contains a rule
that a contract by which two or more persons agree that any dispute which has arisen or which may
arise between them in respect of any subject or class of subjects shall be referred to arbitration is not
illegal. The question, therefore, is whether the contracts barring payment of interest extinguish the
rights of the parties. Exception 1 to Section 28 reads as under :
“Exception 1: Saving of contract to refer to arbitration dispute that may arise. – This
section shall not render illegal a contract, by which two or more persons agree that
any dispute which may arise between them in respect of any subject or class of
subjects shall be referred to arbitration, and that only the amount awarded in such
arbitration shall be recoverable in respect of the dispute so referred.”
20. Exception I to Section 28 saves contracts where the right to move the Court for appropriate
relief is restricted but where the parties have agreed to resolve their dispute through arbitration.
Thus, a lawful agreement to refer the matter to arbitration can be made a condition precedent before
going to courts and it does not violate Section 28. No cause of action then accrues until the
Arbitrator has made the award and the only amount awarded in such arbitration is recoverable in
respect of the dispute so referred. Section 31(7)(a) of the 1996 Act which allows parties to waive any
claim to interest including pendente lite and the power of the Arbitrator to grant interest is subject
to the agreement of the parties.
21. It is pertinent to note that interest payments are governed in general by the Interest Act, 1978 in
addition to the specific statutes that govern an impugned matter. Section 2 (a) of the Interest Act
defines a “Court” which includes both a Tribunal and an Arbitrator. In turn, Section 3 allows a
“Court” to grant interest at prevailing interest rates in various cases. The provisions of Section 3 (3)
of the Interest Act, 1978 explicitly allows the parties to waive their claim to an interest by virtue of
an agreement. Section 3(3)(a)(ii) states that the Interest Act will not apply to situations where the
payment of interest is “barred by virtue of an express agreement”.
22. Thus, when there is an express statutory permission for the parties to contract out of receiving
interest and they have done so without any vitiation of free consent, it is not open for the Arbitrator
to grant pendent lite interest. We are of the considered opinion that Clause 17 of the contract is not
ultra vires in terms of Section 28 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.
23. In the result, the appeal fails and is accordingly dismissed. Having regard to the facts and
circumstances of the case, we direct the parties to bear their own costs.
24. Pending application, if any, shall also stand disposed of.
