JUDGMENT
1. All these writ petitions can be dealt with under a common judgment since they question the
validity of section 5B of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act, 1957, introduced by the Amendment Act No. 27
of 1985, with effect from 1st April, 1986.
2. We propose to note the facts in Writ Petitions Nos. 2064 to 2067 of 1988 :
The petitioners are civil engineering contractors engaged in civil construction work in
the State of Karnataka. In order to bring the activity of works contract within the
purview of power to levy sales tax by the respective State, amendments were
introduced extending the definition of "sale" under article 366(29-A) of the
Constitution of India. Following the constitutional amendment, the Karnataka Sales
Tax Act was amended by the Amendment Act No. 27 of 1985. In pursuance of the
amendment, the Karnataka Sales Tax Rules were also amended by the Karnataka
Sales Tax (Amendment) Rules, 1986.
As a result of the aforesaid amendments, the activity of the petitioner in the nature of
works contract in the State, has been brought within the scope of the Karnataka Sales
Tax Act.
The petitioners challenge the constitutionality of the Forty-Sixth amendment, as well
as the amendments made to the Karnataka Sales Tax Act. The challenge is in three
stages :
(i) the constitutional amendment of procedural and substantive aspect;
(ii) the power of the respective State Legislature to levy and determine tax on works
contract without a law made under article 286(3)(b) of the Constitution; and
(iii) the Karnataka Amending Act 27 of 1985 on various grounds of illegality.
By the Forty-sixth Amendment, the definition of "sale" under article 366(29-A) is not an enabling
amendment. The power to levy sales tax can only be traced to entry 54 of List II in the State List of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1206975/ 1Builders Association Of India vs State Of Karnataka And Others on 27 July, 1990
the Seventh Schedule. That entry has not been amended by the Forth-sixth amendment. Therefore,
merely because clause (29-A) of article 366 of the Constitution was amended, that will not enable
the State Government to levy sales tax on works contract. This is because the said article cannot be
taken as a source of power, for the simple reason that the connected definitions of "goods" under the
Sales of Goods Act, 1930, and "sale" under the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 have not been amended.
Even assuming it is deemed to amend entry 54 of List II, there is no ratification by not less than one
half of the State Legislatures as required under article 368 of the Constitution.
The Forty-sixth amendment is also violative of the concept of basic structure doctrine. Though
article 286 has been amended, till date the Parliament does not come out with any law fixing the
rate of sales tax on works contract. Therefore, the State law will be unconstitutional.
Coming to the definition of "sale" under section 2(1)(t)(ii), it is not only vague and arbitrary but the
explanation (3)(c) to section 2(1)(t) is a clear violation of the Sale of Goods Act. Hence it is
repugnant to the State law. Therefore it violates article 254 of the Constitution.
The definition of "works contract" under sub-clause (v-i) of section 2(1) is wider and ultra vires of
the definition of "sale" under the Amendment Act No. 27 of 1985.
Section 5B, the charging section on works contract, is ultra vires of section 5(4) of the Act because of
the non obstante clause. As a result, the said section contradicts section 5(4) of the Act. In levying
the tax, it is arbitrary and without any nexus.
The Rules are ambiguous and contradictory to various clauses provided in it. The nature of the civil
contract is such that it is highly impossible to determine and calculate as any other transfer of
property in goods the actual quantum of the works carried over every month and to maintain stock
books. Clauses (m) and (n) of rule 6, while granting exemption have imposed unreasonable
restrictions which are violative of article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.
The Rules have unnecessarily classified a section scheme of tax structure, one for ascertainable
labour charges under the Sixth Schedule and another for unascertainable labour charges under rule
6(n). It is arbitrary because the Sixth Schedule provides 18 categories of works contracts while rule 6
provides only 6 categories. Therefore, there is not only discrimination but there is no nexus, hence
violative of article 14 of the Constitution.
On the above averments, a writ of declaration is prayed for to declare the provisions of sections
2(1)(k)(viii), 2(1)(t)(ii) and explanation (3)(c), 2(1)(v-i), 5B, 6B and Sixth Schedule of the Karnataka
Sales Tax Act as amended by the amending Act No. 27 of 1985, and the Rules made relating to the
levy of sales tax on works contract, as illegal, unconstitutional and violative of articles 14, 19(1)(g),
38, 39, 246, 254, 265 and 301 to 304 of the Constitution of India, in so far as the petitioners are
concerned.
3. Mr. K. K. Venugopal, Senior Advocate, learned counsel for the petitioners, submits in support of
the above grounds raised in the writ petitions after drawing our attention to the relevant provisions,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1206975/ 2Builders Association Of India vs State Of Karnataka And Others on 27 July, 1990
that the amending Act No. 27 of 1985 was passed at a time when the supreme Court had not
delivered the judgment in Builders Association of India v. Union of India . The Supreme Court
evolved the concept of transfer of goods in a works contract similar to transfer of goods by sale to a
customer the result being the constitutional restrictions and provisions of the Central Sales tax Act
were made applicable. The Supreme Court ruled that the transfer of gods in a works contract will be
a fictional sale. It had further ruled that those sales are subject to the same constitutional
limitations. Therefore, one cannot get away from them. Unfortunately, explanation (3)(c) to section
2(1)(t) lays down a different principle than what is contemplated under article 286(2) of the
Constitution. The said explanation (3)(c) speaks of situs while dealing with the transfer of goods.
The situs has been fixed as the place of delivery of goods. This is without regard to article 286(2) of
the Constitution and section 4 and 5 of the Central Sales ax Act. Therefore it is bad.
The provisions of the Central Sales Tax Act, particularly sections 3, 4 and 5, deal with computation
of the various transactions. If that be so, neither the situs nor the transfer of property would be
relevant. If therefore, they are irrelevant for actual sales it should be so for fictional sale or a deemed
sale as well.
The situs was fixed under section 4 of the Central Sales Tax Act without reference to transfer of
property. Since the existing laws would cover all sales, any attempt by the State Legislature to have a
different concept in the State would be contrary to section 4 of the Central Sales Tax Act. Hence it is
unconstitutional. Even if explanation (3)(c) to section 2(1)(t) of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act is
struck down, clauses (a) and (b) of the said explanation will take care of fictional sales as well, leave
alone they being covered by the actual sale.
Coming to section 5B of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act, to deprive the contractor of single point is
clearly discriminatory. The said section is void in so far as it refers to the Sixth Schedule because the
said Schedule itself refers to the nature of works done by a contractor and not the goods.
Secondly, the same item of goods used in the works contract is taxed differently. The end user is
irrelevant. As a mater of fact, this is the dictum of the judgment (Builders Association case) (at page
400 of STC; para 36 at page 1390 of AIR).
In view of the above submissions, the question that may arise will be, if the Schedule is bad, the
taxing provision cannot be worked out. Where therefore it is possible to sever section 5B removing
the non obstante clause even then the rest of the section can remain by the application of doctrine of
severability as was held in R. M. D. Chamarbaugwalla v. Union of India .
Under article 286 of the Constitution, Parliament alone has been conferred with the power to levy
the tax. If the fictional sales are brought in so as to enable the State Legislature to tax, it would be
clearly violative of the said article. Therefore, it is the Parliament which has to determine what is
sale or purchase under clause (29-A) of article 366.
Though article 286(2) says that Parliament may by law formulate the principle for determining as to
when a sale or purchase takes place "may" in this context must mean "shall". In support of this
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1206975/ 3Builders Association Of India vs State Of Karnataka And Others on 27 July, 1990
submission, the learned counsel cites Principles of Statutory Interpretation by Justice G. P. Singh,
IV Edition, page 244.
Further, explanation (3)(c) to section 2 is violative of article 286. Therefore this explanation has to
be struck down as otherwise the State may claim immunity and proceed to levy tax even though
such striking down does not advance the case of the petitioners.
4. Mr. K. Srinivasan, supporting the arguments of Mr. Venugopal, submits that article 286(1)(a) of
the Constitution talks of sale outside the State. This is what is contemplated under section 4 of the
Central Sales Tax Act. Therefore, explanation (3)(c) to section 2(1)(t) of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act
is directly opposed to section 4 of the Central Sales Tax Act.
The Forty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution says that even in case of works contract it has to be
treated as a sale, the rate of taxation on transfer of goods involved, it is different in a labour contract
or contract of service in comparison to ordinary sale, it would be discriminatory in nature and,
therefore, must be held to be bad.
While construing section 5B of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act, it must be subject to section 5, 3 and 4.
The non obstante clause at the opening of the section will have to be struck down. The learned
counsel draws our attention to rule 6; a similar provision in Bihar Sales Tax Rules was struck down
as seen from Jamshedpur Contractor's Association v. State of Bihar [1989] 75 STC 132 (Pat).
Mr. Vijayan, learned counsel, supplementing his arguments, would say that in the absence of a situs
of sale being demarcated in article 286(2) or article 269(3) of the Constitution, the State law is
premature. Therefore, section 5B of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act is violative of these provisions.
The next submission of the learned counsel is that explanation (3)(c) to section 2(1)(t)(ii) of the
Karnataka Sales Tax Act prescribes a peculiar test which is violative of article 286 of the
Constitution. This is precisely what is criticised in (Builders Association case) (a page 396 and 397 of
STC; para 32 at page 1388 of AIR). The learned counsel further cites Goodyear India Ltd. v. State of
Haryana and particularly the passages occurring at pages 85 and 86, and submits that there is no
legislative authority for enacting section 5B of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act. Section 5B will have to
go since it proposes to tax the conglomerate.
5. The learned counsel appearing in Writ Petition No. 4070 of 1987 cites (Builders Association of
India v. Union of India) and draws our attention to the facts in that writ petition. He also adopts the
arguments advanced by the other learned counsel.
6. Mr. M. R. Achar, learned Government Advocate, appearing for the State of Karnataka, meets
these points in the following manner :
Nowhere does the Supreme Court in (Builders Association of India v. Union of India)
say that the State has no power to fix the situs. That ruling merely held that the State
while proposing the tax on fictional sales must conform to the constitutional
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1206975/ 4Builders Association Of India vs State Of Karnataka And Others on 27 July, 1990
provisions and also the limitations contained in the Constitution as well as the
Central Sales Tax Act. The same question as is advanced by the petitioners, came up
for consideration in Ranjit Kumar v. Commercial Tax Officer . It was rejected as is
seen from the passage occurring in pages 504 and 505. It is incorrect to contend that
the State has no power in the absence of a law made by the Parliament under article
286(2) of the Constitution. It should be carefully noted that the said article used the
word "may" likewise article 286(3). Only when a law is made by the Parliament
should the State law be repugnant to such Parliamentary enactment, it would be, to
the extent of repugnancy, bad, but no otherwise. There is no possibility of construing
this word "may" as "shall". In other words clauses (2) and (3) of article 286 of the
Constitution are enabling provisions conferring power on the Parliament.
The argument of the petitioners that explanation (3)(c) to section 2(1)(t)(ii) of the
Karnataka Sales Tax Act lays down a different principle and speaks of situs with
reference to delivery of goods disregardful of article 286 of the Constitution and
section 4 and 5 of the Central Sales Tax Act, is fallacious. The explanation uses the
same words as occurring in sub-clause (b) of clause (29-A) of article 366 of the
Constitution. This is precisely what was held by the Supreme Court in Builders
Association of India v. Union of India of STC; paras 32 and 33 at pages 1388 and
1389 of AIR), which he would press into service for the purpose of this case.
In more or less identical circumstances in 20th Century Finance Corporation Limited
v. State of Maharashtra [1989] 75 STC 217 (Bom) at pages 226 and 227, a similar
argument came to be repelled. The ratio of the judgment squarely applies to the facts
of this case. Therefore, the question of inter-State sale does not arise here. Only when
the declared goods go into the contract of service as declared goods the limitations
will apply, but not if they change their character.
The contention that different rates of taxation have been prescribed for transfer of
goods in a works contract or contract of service than the actual sale, is factually
wrong. On a comparison of the Second Schedule and the Sixth Schedule it would be
seen that the rates are same excepting item 6 of the Second Schedule, Part P
prescribing 8 per cent and item 20 of the Sixth Schedule prescribing 15 per cent. On
that score it cannot be urged that there is any discrimination because it is one of the
fundamental postulates of law of taxation that the Legislature has a wide discretion in
choosing the objects of taxation. There can be difference in rates. This is very clear if
Twyford Tea Co. Ltd. v. State of Kerala is referred to.
The entire argument about the vires of section 5B of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act or
that it is opposed to other sections proceeds on a misapprehension. This section
contemplates a separate kind of transaction. Therefore, it has so proceeded with
reference to such of those transactions which are taken within it, viz., what were not
sales earlier. In order to fix the taxable turnover of transfer of property in goods in
the execution of works contract, it is this section alone which has to be looked at. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1206975/ 5Builders Association Of India vs State Of Karnataka And Others on 27 July, 1990
rules only enable the fixation of such a turnover. Rule 6 deals with determination of
total and taxable turnover. While arriving at the taxable turnover, clause (m) of rule 6
speaks of certain categories of works contract mentioned in the Sixth Schedule while
clause (n) takes care of other cases of works contract specified in items 18 and 20 of
the Sixth Schedule. This is merely a method and the working out as to what should be
deducted would depend upon the facts of a particular case. Clause (m) speaks of
actual incurring of labour charges. The excess of labour charges is an integral part of
the sale price. As to how the reasonableness of classification must be approached can
be gathered from Kerala Hotel & Restaurant Association v. State of Kerala .
Therefore, there is nothing axiomatic about these matters. That case helps the State
greatly.
7. Mr. Srinivasan, in his reply, would submit that the ruling of 20th Century Finance Corporation
Limited v. State of Maharashtra [1989] 75 STC. 217 (Bom) will have a bearing only on section 5(1)
and hence cannot be applied to a case arising under section 5B of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act.
With regard to the applicability of section 4 to transfer of goods in a contract of service one must
have regard to the principles laid down in Kerala Hotel's case .
The reply of the other counsel is that the judgment of the Supreme Court in Builders Association
case would apply only prospectively as laid down in Rajah D. V. Seetharamayya Bahadur v. Assistant
Commissioner (1985) 98 Mad LW 896 and an unreported judgment in Writ Appeal No. 826 of 1988.
8. Having regard to the above arguments, the following points arise for our determination :
(i) Scope of the constitutional provisions;
(ii) Scope of the Central Sales Tax Act, particularly section 3, 4 and 5;
(iii) Section 5B of the Karnataka Sales tax Act whether violative of the Constitution or
is repugnant to the provisions of the Central Sales Tax Act;
(iv) Validity of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act;
(v) Prescription of different rates of taxation, whether valid ?
9. Article 269(3) of the Constitution says that Parliament may by law formulate principles for
determining when a sale or purchase of, or consignment of, goods takes place in the course of
inter-State trade or commerce. In exercise of this power the Parliament has enacted section 3 of the
Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. That lays down the principles for determining when a sale or purchase
of goods takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce.
The powder to impose tax on such sales has been given exclusively to the Parliament in view of
article 269(1)(g) of the Constitution read with entry 92-A of List I. This clause also confers upon the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1206975/ 6Builders Association Of India vs State Of Karnataka And Others on 27 July, 1990
Parliament the power to lay down the principles for determining when a sale or purchase of goods
takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce so as to be liable to the Central sales tax.
10. The next important article to be looked at is article 286 of the Constitution. We would rather do
well to extract the entire article because it has undergone important changes by the Forty-sixth
amendment :
"286. Restrictions as to imposition of ax on the sale or purchase of goods.- (1) No law
of a State shall impose, or authorise the imposition of, a tax on the sale or purchase of
goods where such sale or purchase takes place -
(a) outside the State; or
(b) in the course of the import of the goods into, or export of the goods out of, the
territory of India.
(2) Parliament may by law formulate principles for determining when a sale or
purchase of goods takes place in any of the ways mentioned in clause (1).
(3) Any law of a State shall, in so far as it imposes, or authorises the imposition of, -
(a) a tax on the sale or purchase of goods declared by Parliament by law to be of
special importance in inter-State trade or commerce; or
(b) a tax on the sale or purchase of goods, being a tax of the nature referred to in
sub-clause (b), sub-clause (c) or sub-clause (d) of clause (29-A) of article 366, be
subject to such restrictions and conditions in regard to the system of levy, rates and
other incidents of the tax as Parliament may by law specify."
Clause (3) has been substituted by the Forty-sixth amendment of 1982. The object of the
amendment is to create a legal fiction to determine the situs of the sale. Since the law remained
somewhat confusing that came to be settled by the Parliament enacting the Central Sales Tax Act in
1956. Section 4 of that Act provides a simple test of physical location of the goods by determining
the situs of a sale as between more than one State. It should be noticed that clause (2) did not take
away the legislative competence of the State to impose a tax on sales taking place in the course of
inter-state trade or commerce. But it merely subjected it to a legislation by Parliament. After
introduction of entry 92-A of List I by the Sixth amendment the legislative power to tax sales taking
place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce has been vested exclusively in the Parliament.
In so far as article 286 lays down such limitations upon the power of the State to enact legislation for
purposes of taxing sales it is required on our part to find out as to what those limitations are. In our
view, the limitations can be stated as follows :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1206975/ 7Builders Association Of India vs State Of Karnataka And Others on 27 July, 1990
(i) In view of clause (1)(a) no tax shall be imposed on a sale or purchase which takes
place outside the State.
(ii) In view of clause (1)(b) equally no tax shall be imposed on a sale or purchase
which takes place in the course of import into, or export out of, India.
Even with regard to inter-State trade or commerce there are two other limitations :
(i) The power to tax sales taking place in the course of inter-State trade or-commerce
is within the exclusive competence of parliament and this is because of article
269(1)(g) read with entry 92-A of List I.
(ii) Even though the sale does not take place in the course of inter-State trade or
commerce, if the sale were to relate to goods declared by Parliament to be of special
importance in inter-State trade or commerce or if it were to come under article
366(29-A)(a), (b), (c) and (d), such a State taxation would be subject to the
restrictions and conditions imposed by Parliament.
Therefore, it will follow that so long as these limitations are not transgressed, should it be a case of
intra-State sale that could be the subject-matter of State sales tax.
Clause (29-A) of article 366 of the Constitution speaks of tax on the sale or purchase of goods. It
reads :
"(29-A) 'tax on the sale or purchase of goods' includes -
(a) a tax on the transfer, otherwise than in pursuance of a contract, of property in any
goods for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;
(b) a tax on the transfer of property in goods (whether as goods or in some other
form) involved in the execution of a works contract;
(c) a tax on the delivery of goods on hire purchase or any system of payment by
instalments;
(d) a tax on the transfer of the right to use any goods for any purpose (whether or not
for a specified period) for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;
(e) a tax on the supply of goods by any unincorporated association or body of persons
to a member thereof for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;
(f) a tax on the supply, by way of or as part of any service or in any other manner
whatsoever, of goods, being food or any other article for human consumption or any
drink (whether or not intoxicating), where such supply or service, is for cash,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1206975/ 8Builders Association Of India vs State Of Karnataka And Others on 27 July, 1990
deferred payment or other valuable consideration, and such transfer, delivery or
supply of any goods shall be deemed to be a sale of those goods by the person making
the transfer, delivery or supply and a purchase of those goods by the person to whom
such transfer, delivery or supply is made."
By this clause, the concept of sale had come to be enlarged. It is no longer confined to the sale as
understood under the Sales of Goods Act.
11. The validity of the Forty-sixth amendment of the Constitution came directly before the Supreme
Court in Builders Association of India v. Union of India because, on the passing of the Forty-sixth
amendment the State Governments commenced to levy sales tax on the turnover of works contract
entered into by the building contractors for constructing houses, factories, bridges, etc. Two points
were urged before the Supreme Court, viz.;
(i) the Forty-sixth amendment was unconstitutional because it had not been ratified by the
Legislatures of not less than one-half of the States; and
(ii) it was not open to the States to ignore the provisions contained in article 286 of the Constitution
and the provisions of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 while making assessments under the sales tax
laws passed by the various States.
On the first point it was held at page 392 of STC (paragraph 29 of AIR) that there has been due
compliance of the provisions contained in the proviso to article 368(2) of the Constitution in that
resolutions had been passed by the Legislatures of 12 states concerning which evidence was
produced before the court. As regards the second point, it was held that the object of the Forty-sixth
Amendment is to convert what is not a sale into a sale. Originally, a transfer of property in goods
involved in the execution of works contract was held to be not a sale as in seen from State of Madras
v. Gannon Dunkerley & Co. (Madras) Ltd. . Such a sale is deemed by fiction of law to be a sale and is
made taxable. In no other respect does the Forty-sixth amendment enlarge the power of the State to
levy sales tax. In deciding the correctness of the submissions, at page 396 of STC (paragrah 32 of
AIR) the Supreme Court has stated as under :
"Before proceeding further it is necessary to understand what sub-clause (b) of clause
(29-A) of article 366 of the Constitution means. Article 366 is the definition clause of
the Constitution. It says that in the Constitution unless the context otherwise
requires, the expressions defined in that article have the meanings respectively
assigned to them in that article. The expression 'goods' is defined in clause (12) of
article 366 of the Constitution as including all materials commodities and articles. It
is true that in State of Madras v. Gannon Dunkerley & Co. (Madras) Ltd. , this Court
held that a works contract was an indivisible contract and the turnover of the goods
used in the execution of the works contract could not, therefore of the goods used in
the execution of the works contract could not therefore, become exigible to sales tax.
It was in order to overcome the effect of the said decision Parliament amended article
366 by introducing sub-clause (b) of clause (29-A). Sub-clause (b) of clause (29-A)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1206975/ 9Builders Association Of India vs State Of Karnataka And Others on 27 July, 1990
states that 'tax on the sale or purchase of goods' includes amoung other things a tax
on the transfer of property in the goods (whether as goods or in some other form)
involved in the execution of a works contract. It does not say that a tax on the sale or
purchase of goods included a tax on the amount paid for the execution of a works
contract. It refers to a tax on the transfer of property in goods (whether as goods or in
some other form) involved in the execution of a work contract. The emphasis is on
the transfer of property in goods (whether as goods or in some other form). The latter
part of clause (29-A) of article 366 of the Constitution makes the position very clear.
While referring to the transfer, delivery or supply of any goods that takes place as per
sub-clauses (a) to (f) of clause (29-A), the latter part of clause (29-A) says that 'such
transfer, delivery or supply of any goods' shall be deemed to be a sale of those goods
by the person making the transfer, delivery or supply and a purchase of those goods
by the person to whom such transfer, delivery or supply and a purchase of those
goods by the person to whom such transfer, deliver or supply is made. Hence, a
transfer of property in goods under sub-clause (b) of clause (29-A) is deemed to be a
sale of goods involved in the execution of works contract by the person making the
transfer and a purchase of those goods by the person to whom such transfer is made.
The object of the new definition introduced in clause (29-A) of article 366 of the
Constitution is, therefore, to enlarge the scope of 'tax on sale or purchase of goods'
wherever it occurs in the Constitution so that it may include within its scope the
transfer delivery or supply of goods that may take place under any of the transactions
referred to in sub-clauses (a) to (f) thereof wherever such transfer, delivery or supply
becomes subject to levy of sales tax. So construed the expression 'tax on the sale or
purchase of goods' in entry 54 of the State List therefore, includes a tax on the
transfer of property in goods (whether as goods or in some other form) involved in
the execution of a works contract also. The tax leviable by virtue of sub-clause (b) of
clause (29-A) of article 366 of the Constitution thus becomes subject to the same
discipline to which any levy under entry 54 of the State List is made subject to under
the Constitution. The position is the same when we look a article 286 of the
Constitution. Clause (1) of article 286 says that no law of a State shall impose or
authorise the imposition of, of tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or
purchase takes place - (a) outside the State; or (b) in the course of the import of the
goods into, or export of the goods out of, the territory of India. Here again we have to
read the expression 'a tax on the sale or purchase of goods' found in article 286 as
including the transfer of goods referred to in sub-clause (b) of clause (29-A) or article
366 which is deemed to be a sale of goods and the tax leviable thereon would be
subject to the terms of clause (1)of article 286. Similarly, the restrictions mentioned
in clause (2) of article 286 of the Constitution which says that Particular may be law
formulate principles for determining when a sale or purchase of goods takes place in
any of the ways mentioned in clause (1) of article 286 would also be attracted to a
transfer of goods contemplated under article 366(29-A)(b). Similarly, clause (3) of
article 286 is also applicable to a tax on a transfer of property referred to in
sub-clause (b) of clause (29-A) of article 366. Clause (3) of article 286 consists of two
pars. Sub-clause (a) of clause (a) of clause (3) of article 286 deals with a tax on the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1206975/ 10Builders Association Of India vs State Of Karnataka And Others on 27 July, 1990
sale or purchase of goods declared by Parliament by law to be a special importance in
inter-State trade or commerce, which is generally applicable to all sales including the
transfer, supply or delivery of goods which are deemed to be sales under clause
(29-A) of article 366 of the Constitution. If any declared goods which are referred to
in section 14 of the Central Sales Tax Act 1956 are involved in such transfer, supply or
delivery which is referred to in clause (29-A) of article 366, the sales tax law of a State
which provides for levy of sales tax thereon will have to comply with the restrictions
mentioned in section 15 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. Clause (b) is an additional
provision which empowers Parliament to impose any additional restrictions or
conditions in regard to the levy of sales tax on transactions which will be deemed to
be sales under sub-clause (b) or sub-clause (c) or sub-clause (d) of clause (29-A) of
article 366 of the Constitution. We do not find much substance in the contention
urged on behalf of the States that since sub-clause (b) of clause (3) of article 286 of
the Constitution refers only to the transactions referred to in sub-clause (b), (c) and
(d) of cause (29-A) of article 366, the transaction referred to under those three
sub-clause would not be subject to any other restrictions set out in clause (1) or clause
(2) or sub-clause (a) of clause (3) or article 286 of the Constitution. It may be that by
virtue of sub-clause (b) of clause (3) of article 286 it is open to Parliament to impose
some other restrictions or conditions which are not generally applicable to all kinds
of sales. That however cannot make the other parts of article 286 inapplicable to the
transactions which are deemed to be sales under article 366(29-A) of article 366 of
the Constitution. We are of the view that all transfers, deliveries and supplies of
goods referred to in clauses (a) to (f) of clause (29-A) of article 366 of the
Constitution are subject to the restrictions and conditions mentioned in clause (1),
clause (2) and sub-clause (a) of clause (3) of article 286 of the Constitution and the
transfers and deliveries that take place under sub-clauses (b), (c) and (d) of clause
(29-A) of article 366 of the Constitution are subject to an additional restriction
mentioned in sub-clause (b) of article 286(3) of the Constitution."
At page 400 and 403 of STC; (paragraphs 36 and 40 of AIR), it is further observed thus :
".......... After the 46th Amendment the works contract which was an indivisible one is
by a legal fiction altered into a contract which is divisible into one for sale of goods
and the other for supply of labour and services. After the 46h Amendment, it has
become possible for the States to levy sales tax on the value of goods involved in a
works contract in the same way in which the sales tax was leviable on the price of the
goods and materials supplied in a building contract which has been entered into in
two distinct and separate parts as stated above ....... When the law creates a legal
fiction such fiction should be carried to is logical end. There should no be any
hesitation in giving full effect to it. If the power to tax a sale in an ordinary sense is
subject to certain conditions and restrictions imposed by the Constitution, the power
to tax a transaction which is deemed to be a sale under article 366(29-A) of the
Constitution should be subject to the same restrictions and conditions.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1206975/ 11Builders Association Of India vs State Of Karnataka And Others on 27 July, 1990
....... We do no accept the argument that sub-clause (b) of article 366(29-A) should be
read as being equivalent to a separate entry in List II of the Seventh Schedule to the
Constitution enabling the State to levy tax on sales and purchase independent of
entry 54 thereof. As the Constitution exists today the power of the States to levy taxes
on sales and purchases of goods including the 'deemed' sales and purchases of goods
under clause (29-A) of article 366 is to be found only in entry 54 and no outside it
.............."
Thus the resultant position is the works contract as referred to in sub-clause (b) of clause (29-A) in
article 366 of the Constitution is subject to tax and is subject to the same restrictions had it been a
sale in the ordinary sense.
Secondly, what were originally considered to be an inseverable contract could now be separated into
two-one for sale of goods and the other for supply of labour and services.
12. With this background, we pass on to the relevant provisions of section 4 and 5 of the Central
Sales Tax Act. After stating in the opening words of section 4 that it is subject to the provisions
contained in section 3, in sub-section (2) an intra-State sale is defined. It is an inside sale in terms of
certain tests for its situs. A sale or purchase of goods is deemed to take place inside the State if the
goods are within the State, in the case of specific or asertained goods at the time when the contract
of sale is made, and in the case of unascertained or future goods at the time of their appropriation to
the contract of sale by the seller or by the buyer whether assent of the other party is prior or
subsequent to such appropriation. The explanation to sun-section (2) says, where there is a single
contract of sale or purchase of goods situated at more places than one, the provisions of sub-section
(2) shall apply as if there were separate contracts in respect of the goods at each of such places.
Thus, in the case of ascertained goods, the place where the goods are situated at the time of the
contract of sale fixes the situs. In the case of unascertained goods, when the appropriation is made
files the situs. Once, therefore, the sale is so fixed inside the State with reference to the above it
should be deemed to have taken place outside all other States.
In order to determine whether a particular transactions is a sale in the course if inter-State trade or
commerce, what is really decisive is whether the sale is one which has occasioned the movement of
the goods from one State to another. It does not depend upon the circumstance as to in which State
the property in the goods passes. It may pass in either State and yet the sale can be an inter-State
sale.
In cases of inter-State sales falling under clause (a) or clause (b) of section 3 of the Central Sales Tax
Act it is not material, for the purpose of the tax levy, to consider the situs of the sale or the State in
which the property in the goods happens to pass. Neither territorial nexus nor titular rights to the
goods nor the theory of origin of the goods nor the theory of outside consumption can be taken to
override "the course of inter-State trade or commerce" when the sale itself occasions the movement
of the goods from one State to another. The rates and levy, etc., follow the provisions of the Act
independently of the situs.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1206975/ 12Builders Association Of India vs State Of Karnataka And Others on 27 July, 1990
There is no antithesis between a sale in the course of inter-State trade or commerce and a sale inside
the State. Even an inter-State sale must have a situs and the situs may be in one State or another. It
does not involve any contradiction in saying that an inter-State sale or purchase is inside a State or
outside it. A sale which is in the course of inter-State trade or commerce cannot be taxed by a State
Legislature even if its situs is within the State because the State Legislature has no legislative
competence to impose tax on sale in the course of inter-State trade or commerce.
In answering the question whether section 4 fixes the situs of sale, the majority held in Tata Iron &
Steel Co, Ltd. v. S. R. Sarkar that sub-section (2) defines what sales or purchase shall be deemed to
take place inside a State. The terms of sub-section (2) are quite general, and Parliament has thereby
attempted to locate the place where a sale takes place. The clause does not deal with the conditions
which "effect"a sale : nor is there any warrant for the view that sub-section (2) of section 4 only
seeks to locate the place of sales which are not in course of inter-State trade or commerce. In
enacting section 4, sub-section (1), Parliament has sough to formulate principles for determining
when a sale takes place outside a State. By sub-section (2), Parliament has attempted to define when
a sale shall be deemed to take place inside a State and then, sub-section (1) provides that when a sale
or purchase of goods was determined in accordance with sub-section (2) to take place inside a State,
such sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place outside all other States.
In other words, the terms of the section disclose that the purpose was to formulate the principles for
determining when a sale takes place outside the State. This section was enacted by Parliament in
exercise if authority under article 286(2) of the Constitution read with clause (1)(a) of article 286. It
is needless to say that clause (1)(a) deals with sale outside the State. The object of section 4 was to
locate the place where the sale took place. Sub-section (2) merely seeks to locate the place of sales
which are in the course of inter-State trade or commerce.
Now we come to the question, under section 4 what tests are adopted to determine the situs. No
concept of inter-State trade can be comprehensive without knowing what is an outside sale and,
therefore an inside sale. An inside sale or an outside sale is related to its situs and if the situs of an
inside sale is fixed on certain, what is not an inside sale will be an outside sale provided there is a
competed there is a completed contract of sale of goods. Section 4(2) defines an inside sale in terms
tests for is situs. A sale or purchase of foods is deemed to take place inside a State if the goods are
within the State in the case of specific or ascertained goods, at the time and contract of sale is made;
and in the case of unasertained or future goods at the time the contract of sale by the seller or by the
buyer whether assent of the other party is prior or subsequent to such appropriation. An explanation
to sub-section (2) says that where there is a single contract of sale or purchase of goods situated at
more places than one the provisions of the sub-section shall apply as if there were separate contracts
in respect of the goods at each of such places. The place where the goods situated at the time when
the contract of sale is made in the case of ascertained goods or when appropriation is made in the
case of unascertained goods determines both the situs of such a sale as well as its character as an
inside sale. Once a sale is fixed as having taken place inside a State with reference to such tests, it
should be deemed to have taken place outside all other States. Even an inter-State sale or purchase
or a sale in the course of export of goods our of the territory of India must have a situs. To fix the
situs of a sale is a wholly different matter from taxing that transaction. The situs of a sale may fall to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1206975/ 13Builders Association Of India vs State Of Karnataka And Others on 27 July, 1990
be determined both from the point of view of its exigibility to tax as also its exemption from tax
either under the Constitution or under the taxing statute itself. The bans prescribed by article 286
operate only for the purpose of curtailing the taxing powers of the State and not for any other
purpose. They would not alter the situs of a sale of purchase and its situs would continue to be inside
a particular State a determined by the principles formulated by section 4.
13. With the above legal background we go on to section 5B of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act which is
under challenge in these writ petitions. That section may be quoted in full :
"5B. Levy of tax on transfer of property in goods (whether as goods or in some other
form) involved in the execution of works contracts. - Notwithstanding anything
contained in sub-section (1) or sub-secttion (3) of section 5 but subject to
sub-sections (5) and (6) of the said section, every dealer shall pay for each year, a tax
under this Act on his taxable turnover of property in goods (whether as goods or in
some other form) involved in the execution of works contract mentioned in column
(2) of the Sixth Schedule at the rates specified in the corresponding entries in column
(3) of the said Schedule."
It opens with a non obstante clause. Therefore wherever there is a transfer of goods in a works
contract one is obliged to look a this section alone. It has already been seen that these works
contracts could not have been taxed prior to the Forty-sixth amendment of the Constitution and
now these transactions have become taxable. Section 5B came to be introduced by Karnataka Act
No. 27 of 1985 with effect from 1st April 1986. The object and reasons behind this amendment are as
follows :
"It is proposed in the Budget speech for the year 1985-86 to levy tax on the transfer of
property in goods (whether as goods or in some other form) involved in the execution
of works contract on the transfer of the right to use goods, on the delivery of goods on
hire-purchase or any other kind of payment by instalments; for payment of interest
for belated refunds; to prescribe time-limit for concluding assessment; to simplify
summary assessments; and to give certain concessions and reliefs."
Therefore the definition of "sale had also to be enlarged. Section 2(1)(t)(ii) of the Karnataka Sales
Tax Act reads :
"2. Definitions. - (1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, -
* * *
(t) 'sale' with all its grammatical variation and cognate expressions means every
transfer of the property in goods other than by way of a mortgage, hypothecation
charge or pledge by one person to another in the course of trade or business for cash
or for deferred payment or other valuable consideration and includes, -

(i) a transfer otherwise than in pursuance of a contract of property in any goods for
cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;
(ii) a transfer of property in goods (whether as goods or in some other form) involved
in the execution of a works contract;
(iii) a delivery of goods on hire-purchase or any system of payment by instalments;
(iv) a transfer of the right to use any goods for purpose (whether or not for a specified
period) for cash, deferred payment or other valuable consideration;
Explanation. - (1) A transfer of property involved in the supply or distribution of goods by a society
(including a co-operative society), club firm or any association to its members, for cash or for
deferred payment or other valuable consideration, whether or not in the course of business, shall be
deemed to be a sale for the purpose of this Act.
(2) .................... (omitted).
(3)(a) The sale or purchase of goods other than in the course of inter-State trade or commerce or in
the course of import or export, shall be deemed, for the purpose of this Act, to have taken place in
the State wherever the contract of sale or purchase might have been made, if the goods are within
the State, -
(i) in the case of specific or ascertained goods, at the time the contract of sale or purchase is made;
and
(ii) in the case of unascertained or future goods, a the time of their appropriation to the contract of
sale or purchase by the seller or by the purchaser, whether the assent of the other party is prior or
subsequent to such appropriation.
(b) Where there is a single contract of sale or purchase of goods situated at more places than one the
provisions of clause (a) shall apply as if there were separate contracts in respect of the goods at each
of such places.
(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 (Central Act 3 of 1930), for
the purpose of this Act, the transfer of property in goods (whether as goods or in some other form)
involved in the execution of a works contract shall be deemed to have taken place in the State, if the
goods are within the State at the time of such transfer, irrespective of the place where the agreement
for works contract is made, whether the assent of the other party is prior or subsequent to such
transfer.
(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 (Central Act 3 of 1930) for
the purpose of this Act, the transfer of the right to use any goods for any purpose (whether or not for
a specified period) shall be deemed to have taken place in the State, if such goods are for use within
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1206975/ 15Builders Association Of India vs State Of Karnataka And Others on 27 July, 1990
the State, irrespective of the place where the contract of transfer of the right to use the goods is
made.
(3A) Every transaction of supply by way of or as a part of any service or in other manner whatsoever,
of goods being food or any other article for human consumption or any drink (whether or not
intoxicating) where such supply or service is for cash, deferred payment or other valuable
consideration, shall be deemed to be a sale of those goods by the person making the supply and
purchase of those goods by the person to whom such supply is made;
............"
At this stage it is necessary for us to note that explanation (3) extracted above is a verbatim
reproduction of section 4 of the Central Sales Tax Act.
In the present case we are concerned with transfer of property in goods, whether quo goods or in
some other form, involved in the execution of works contract. The argument of Mr. Venugopal is
that sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Central Sales Tax Act cover all transactions of sale. Both the situs and
the transfer of property are irrelevant for the purpose of taxation under those provisions. If that be
so for the actual sales, it should be a fortiori for a deemed sale as well. The learned draws inspiration
because inspiration because in paragraph 32 of the judgment in (Builders Association case) the
Supreme Court held that all transfers, deliveries and supplies of goods referred to in clauses (a) and
(b) of clause (29-A) of article 366 of the Constitution are subject to the same restrictions. Therefore,
according to him, the situs was fixed under section 4 of the Central Sales Tax Act, and if the existing
laws would cover all sales any attempt by Legislature to add something different to its own State
contrary to section 4 of the Central sales Tax Act is unconstitutional.
In opposing this stand Mr. Achar, learned Government Advocate, would say that the State has the
power to tax on such transfer of right to use the goods irrespective of where the contract has taken
place or not. In support of this submission reliance is placed on 20th Century Finance Corporation
Limited v. State of Maharastra [1989] 75 STC 217 (Bom). In that case, the validity of the
Maharashtra Sales Tax on the Transfer of the Right to use any goods for any purpose Act, 1985,
came up for consideration. The object of that Act was to levy and collect sales tax upon the transfer
of the right to use any goods for the purposes of cash or deferred payment or other valuable
consideration within the State. In upholding the constitutional validity of that Act it was held as
follows (at pages 226 and 227) :
"By reason of the said explanation, transfer of the right to use any goods shall be
deemed to have taken place in the State of Maharashtra, irrespective of the place
where the agreement for such transfer of the right to use took place, if the goods are
in the State of Maharashtra at the time of their use. In other words, the situs or the
location of the goods at the time of there use has been chosen as the basis of taxability
under the Act. Thus, in view of the amended explanation to section 2(10) of the
impugned Act, the place where an agreement is made for transfer of the right to use
goods is irrelevant and under the impugned Act, the State of Maharashtra has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1206975/ 16Builders Association Of India vs State Of Karnataka And Others on 27 July, 1990
assumed power to levy tax on such transfer of the right to use goods which are
located in the State of Maharashtra at the time of their use. In our view, the said
provisions contained in the explanation to section 2(10) does not result in bringing
inter-State sales or sales taking place outside the State of Maharashtra within the
scope of the impugned Act. The reported decisions upon which the learned counsel
had relied were rendered in the context of sale transactions which then only meant
transfer of property in goods. We have already pointed out that after clause (29-A)
was inserted in article 366, tax on sale or purchase of goods included inter alia, tax on
transfer of the right to use for any purpose goods for cash, deferred payment or other
valuable consideration. Therefore, the validity of a tax on such transfer of right to use
ought not to be tested by applying these reported decisions regarding the meaning of
sale. It would not be also appropriate to apply the tests applicable for deciding when
property in goods passes in case of transfers of the right to use goods for any purpose.
The legal concepts of transfer of the right to use goods are quite different."
No doubt an attempt was made by Mr. Srinivasan that this decisions may apply to section 5C but not
to section 5B. But, we are of the opinion that the ratio of that judgment would squarely apply
because at pages 230 and 231 it is stated as follows :
"Only when the said goods are transferred by the petitioners for use by the lessees,
the transfer becomes taxable. In other words, the impugned Act levies tax only when
the lessee is put in possession for using the goods. According to the claim made by
the petitioners themselves therefore, the movement, if any, of goods pursuant to the
orders placed by the 1st petitioner upon the manufactures and suppliers precedes the
transfer of the right to use in favour of the lessee. The impugned Act levies tax upon
transfer of the right to use goods which are within Maharashtra at the time of their
use."
Accordingly, should the goods involved in the execution of the works contract be within the State of
Karnataka at the time of transfer the value of such goods would become taxable. Certainly should
the declared goods go in as declared goods, the limitations contained in the other Acts would apply,
but not if hey change their character.
When section 5B of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act opens with a non obstante clause the intention of
the Legislature is clear that the sales as understood generally are not to be tagged on to these
deemed sales. It also requires to be noted here that the language used here is the same as in article
366(29-A), sub-clause (b). If, therefore with reference to goods that are available within the State of
Karnataka in a works contract, the State were to proceed to tax in exercise of its competence under
entry 54 of List II, we are unable to say as to how it could be held violative of either the Constitution
or the Central Sales Tax Act.
We are equally unable to accept the argument that unless the Parliament makes the law under
article 286 of the Constitution, power to tax cannot arise. Article 286 only lays down certain
restriction. As to what those restrictions are, have already been noted. To our mind it is clear that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1206975/ 17Builders Association Of India vs State Of Karnataka And Others on 27 July, 1990
there is no infringement of any one of those restrictions. If, therefore, section 5B of the Karnataka
Sales Tax Act is an independent provision with regard to taxing the value of the goods involved in
works contract, we cannot accept this argument.
We are also of the view that there is no scope for striking down explanation (3)(c) to section
2(1)(t)(ii) of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act. The said clause clearly states that if the goods are within
the State at the time of transfer it would be taxable. It has already been noted that the ratio of the
decision in [1989] 75 STC 217 (Bom) (20th Century Finance Corporation Limited v. State of
Maharashtra), though with reference to the user of the goods would apply to the works contract as
well. In such a case, therefore, we see no scope for an argument of this character.
For the same reason the argument of Mr. Vijayan that in the absence of situs of sale being
demarcated in article 286(2) or 269(3) of the Constitution the State law is premature, does not
appear to us to be tenable.
In (Goodyear India Ltd. v. State of Haryana) it was held that the mere despatch of goods by a
manufacturer to his own branches outside the State does not amount to sale or disposal of goods as
such; the consignment or despatch of goods is neither a sale nor a purchase. In so far as section
9(1)(b) of the Haryana General Sales Tax Act, 1973 provides for taxable event which is closely related
to the despatch, it cannot be held to be a tax on sale or purchase. But the position here is different.
In finding out the true nature of the goods under that Act it was found that the section itself does not
provide for the imposition of tax on the transaction of purchase of taxable goods, and when further
the said taxable goods are used up and turned into independent goods losing their original identity
and thereafter when the manufactured goods are despatched outside the State of Haryana, only then
tax is levied and liability to pay tax is created. In contradistinction to this, under section 5B read
with section 2(1)(t)(ii), explanation (3)(c) of the Karnataka Sales Tax, if the goods involved in the
execution of the works contract are within the State at the time of such transfer, the State could levy
the tax. Therefore, the levy has direct connection with the transaction of transfer of goods involved
in the execution of works contract. Hence the decision in (Goodyear India Ltd. v. State of Haryana)
has no application to the facts of this case.
It is also incorrect to contend that section 5B proposes to tax the conglomerate. On the contrary it
merely seeks to tax the value of the property in goods, either as goods or in some other form,
involved in the execution of works contract mentioned in column (2) of the Sixth Schedule. If this
test could be adopted for purposes of local taxation, it is not necessary that section 4 of the Central
Sales Tax Act must be amended for the working of explanation (3)(c) of section 2(1)(t)(ii) of the
Karnataka Sales Tax Act.
The contention of Mr. Venugopal is that section 5B is void in so far as it refers to the Sixth Schedule
because that Schedule refers to the nature of works done by the contractor and not the goods. In
other words, according to him, the same item of goods used in the works contract is taxed
differently; the end user is irrelevant. This argument ignores the power of the Legislature to treat the
works contract alone as a separate entity and on that basis with regard to the value of the property
involved in the execution of works contract to levy the tax depending upon the nature of the works
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1206975/ 18Builders Association Of India vs State Of Karnataka And Others on 27 July, 1990
contract. The petitioners cannot compare this with an ordinary sale and contend that the end user is
irrelevant. What is taxed is only the value of the goods involved in the works contract which has
resulted in the end product.
Only when we find any portion of the section is opposed to the constitutional provision or the
Central Tax Act that part of the section becoming ultra vires, the doctrine of severability can be
pressed into service. But in this case was see no scope for application of the doctrine and
consequently (R. M. D. Chamarbaugwalla v. Union of India) will have no application in the instant
case.
We are also unable to accept the argument that though in clauses (2) and (3) of article 286 of the
Constitution the word "may" is used it must be construed as "shall". We have already set down the
scope of this article. Section 5B does not in any way infringe the article.
Accordingly we hold that section 5B of the Karnataka Sales tax Act is valid. Likewise, explanation
(3)(c) to section 2(1)(t)(ii) does not violate either article 286 or any other constitutional provisions,
nor again is there any repugnancy between the provisions of the Central Sales Tax Act and those
sections of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act.
14. Now we come to the Karnataka Sales Tax Rules. Part II of the Rules deals with turnover and
assessment. Rule 6 occurring in that Part speaks of determination of total and taxable turnover.
While so determining concerning the works contract, sub-rule (4) states that in determining the
turnover the amounts specified in clauses (a) to (p) shall subject to the conditions specified therein
be deducted from the total turnover as determined under clauses (a) to (e) of sub-rule (1). Clause
(m) of sub-rule (4) reads as follows :
"(m) in the case of works contracts specified in serial numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12 and 17 of the Sixth Schedule;
(i) all amounts for which any goods specified in the said serial numbers and falling
under Second Schedule are purchased from registered dealers liable to pay tax under
the Act,
(ii) all amounts actually expended towards 'labour charges' for erection, installation,
fixing, fitting out, or commissioning of the goods specified in the said serial numbers,
(iii) all amounts paid to sub-contractors as the consideration for execution of works
contract whether wholly or partly :
Provided that, no such deduction shall be allowed unless the dealer claiming
deduction produces proof that the sub-contractor is a registered dealer liable to tax
under the Act and that the turnover of such amounts is included in the monthly
statement or return of turnover as the case may be, filed by such sub-contractor;"
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1206975/ 19Builders Association Of India vs State Of Karnataka And Others on 27 July, 1990
The complaint before us is that while the second sub-clause of clause (m) would take note of actual
amounts expended towards labour charges, in clause (n) sub-clauses (iv) and (v) a different
treatment is accorded. We will now quote clause (n), sub-clauses (iv) and (v) :
"(n) in the case of works contracts specified in serial numbers 6, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 18
of the Sixth Schedule;
* * *
(iv) such amounts towards 'labour charges and other like charges' not involving any
transfer of property in goods actually incurred in connection with the execution of
works contract, or
(v) such amounts calculated at the rate prescribed in column (3) of the Table below, if
they are actually incurred towards 'labour charges' and other like charges and are not
ascertainable from the books of accounts maintained and produced by a dealer before
the assessing authority.

Provides that where the turnover of a dealer claiming deduction under clauses (m) and (n) in any
year is not sufficient to cover the deduction, it shall be allowed to the extent of the turnover of the
dealer in that year and the balance shall be carried forward to the year following next and so on."
A careful reading of the above rule shows that in cases where the actual expenditure is incurred in
the case of works contract specified under clause (m) the deduction could be claimed. In the case of
other contracts, as per clause (n), the labour charges and the other like charges actually incurred,
could be deducted, then again if they are not ascertainable from the books of account. This could
depend upon the nature of contract and also how the accounts are maintained, that too for the
purposes of deduction. Those are details to be established before the taxing authority and it cannot
be argued in an abstract way. Therefore, heaving open that remedy in that this aspect could be
decided in individual cases depending upon the nature of the contract and the method of keeping
accounts, we hold that rule 6 is not ultra vires.
It is the contention of Mr. Srinivasan that a rule similar to sub-clauses (iv) and (v) of clause (n) of
rule 6(4) under the Bihar Sales Tax Rules 1983, came to be struck down in Jamshedpur Contractors'
Association v. State of Bihar [1989] 75 STC 132 (Pat). We are unable to agree. That rule (rule 13-A of
Bihar Sales Tax Rules) stated that while providing for deduction in case of works contract, on
account of labour charges depending upon different types of contract a percentage would be
deducted. Therefore it was held in paragraph 9 as follows :
"Thus it will be noticed that the rule provides that for different types of works in
works contract, different percentage of labour shall be presumed to have been used
and amount spent to that extent shall be deducted from the gross turnover. Tax is
payable on labour charges under this rule. Under this rule even if the contractor
might have spent more on labour charges than the prescribed percentage stated in
the rule the contractor shall no be entitled to claim deduction beyond what has been
provided. In other words tax is levied on labour charge. Neither sale nor purchase of
any goods is involved when a contractor spends on account of labour. "Labour'
cannot be said to be a goods even within the definition of 'goods' in the Act. From the
gross turnover, the total amount spent by the contractor as labour charges in
execution of the works contract shall have to be excluded. Rule 13-A cannot be
sustained and must be held to be ultra vires."
But, here it is not so. On the contrary the actual charges incurred is deducted and what is sought to
be taxed is only the value of the goods in the execution of works contract after such deduction as is
permitted under sub-clauses (iv) and (v) of clause (n). Therefore, rule 6 is intra vires.
15. The next question is whether the prescription of different rates of taxes is violative of article 14 of
the Constitution. The arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioners proceed on a wrong
hypothesis as though different rates have been prescribed. The rates under the Second Schedule and
the Sixth Schedule are the same, expect with regard to item No. 6 of the Second Schedule, Part-P
where for pipes, tubes and fittings of iron not falling under the Fourth Schedule, cement and
asbestos the rate of taxation is 8 per cent whole for the corresponding item No. 20 of the Sixth

Schedule the rate of taxation is 10 per cent. To the extent of this discrimination it may be bad. As a
mater of fact Mr. Achar, learned Government Advocate, does not seriously dispute this
discrimination. Therefore, that alone has to be struck down. But, as a general principle, can it be
said the prescription of different rates is bad ? We do not think so, because it is one of the
well-Settled principles that the Legislature has freedom to choose the object of taxation. In Twyford
Tea Co. Ltd. v. State of Kerala , the Supreme Court has observed thus :
"15. We may now state the principles on which the present case must be decided.
These principles have been stated earlier but are often ignored when the question of
the application of article 14 arises. One principle on which our Courts (as indeed the
Supreme Court in the United States) have always acted, is nowhere better stated than
by Willis in his "Constitutional Law', page 587. This is how the put it :
'A State dos not have to tax everything in order to tax something. It is allowed to pick
and choose districts, objects, persons, methods and even rates for taxation if it does
so reasonably ....... The Supreme Court has been practical and has permitted a very
wide latitude in classification for taxation.' This principle was approved by this Court
in East India Tobacco Co. v. State of Andhra Pradesh . Applying it, the Court
observed :
"If a State can validly pick and choose one commodity for taxation and that is not
open to attack under article 14, the same result must follow when the State picks out
one category of goods and subjects it to taxation."
This indicates a wide range of selection and freedom in appraisal not only in the objects of taxation
and the manner of taxation but also in the determination of the rate or rates applicable. If
production must always be taken into account there will have to be a settlement for every year and
the tax would become a kind of income-tax.
16. The next principle is that burden of proving discrimination is always heavy and heavier still
when a taxing statute is under attack. This was also observed in the same case of this Court at page
534 of STC (at page 41 of SCR; at page 1735 of AIR) approving the dictum of the Supreme Court of
the United States in Madden v. Kentucky [1940] 309 US 83; 84 Law Ed 590 :
'In taxation even more than in other fields, Legislatures possess the greatest freedom
in classification. The burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to
negative every conceivable basis which might support it.' As Rottschaefer said in his
Constitutional Law at page 668 :
' "A statute providing for the assessment of one type of intangible a its actual value
while other intangibles are assessed at their face value does not deny equal protection
even when both are subject to the same rate of tax." The decisions of the Supreme
Court in this field have permitted a State Legislature to exercise "an extremely wide
discretion" in classifying property for tax purposes "so long as it refrained from clear
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1206975/ 22Builders Association Of India vs State Of Karnataka And Others on 27 July, 1990
and hostile discrimination against particular persons or classes".' The burden is on a
person complaining of discrimination. The burden is proving not possible 'inequality'
but hostile 'unequal' treatment. This is more so when uniform taxes are levied. It is
not proved to us how the different plantations can be said to be 'hostilely or
unequally' treated. A uniform wheel tax on cars does not take into account the value
of the car, the mileage it runs, or in the case of taxis, the profits it makes and the
miles per gallon it delivers. An Ambassador taxi and a Fiat taxi give different outturns
in terms of money and mileage. Cinemas pay the same show fee. We do not take a
doctrinaire view of equality. The Legislature has obviously thought of equalising the
tax through a method which is inherent in the tax scheme. Nothing has been said to
show that there is inequality much less 'hostile treatment'. All that is said is that the
State must demonstrate equality. That is not the approach. At this rate nothing can
ever be proved to be equal to another."
This fully supports the stand of the State that there is a wide discretion to pick and
choose the objects for purposes of taxation. here cannot be any uniformity about the
same. Therefore, except the discrimination pointed out with regard to item No. 6 of
the Second Schedule and item No. 20 of the Sixth Schedule, the rates of taxation with
regard to other items of the Second Schedule are to be upheld.
17. One more question posed before us is as to from what date our judgment is to be effective ? The
complaint of the petitioners is that they had not charged their customers the sales tax and they are
obliged to pay from their pockets. On this aspect of the matter, when we put it to the learned
Government Advocate a memo was filed with regard to composition for the years 1986-87 to
1989-90 (i.e. up to 31s March, 1990). We passed a separate order on 19th July, 1990, in respect of
the dealers who had agreed for the composition and other dealers in terms of the memo. This means
that our judgment would be effective from 1st April, 1990, onwards.
18. Subject to the above, we dismiss all these writ petitions with costs. Counsel's fee Rs. 250 in each
petition.
19. Writ Petitions dismissed.
