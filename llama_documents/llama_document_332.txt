N.I. Act, Police Station P.G.I., District Lucknow as well as to set aside the entire proceedings in
pursuance thereof pending before the learned Presiding Officer, Additional Court No.10, Lucknow.
4. Learned counsel for the applicants submitted that the present case arises out of complaint
preferred by the opposite party no.2. The applicant no.1 is a company incorporated under the
Companies Act, 1956 bearing Corporate Identification Number (CIN) U60301UP1957PLC023015
and having its registered office at Mehrab Tower, Sixth Floor TC-16V, Vibhuti Khand, Gomti Nagar,
Lucknow (hereinafter referred as "Company" for sake of brevity). The applicant no.2 is the
Managing Director of the Company and the affairs of the Company are run and managed by him.
5. Learned counsel for the applicants further submitted that on 17.11.2021, the opposite party no.2
preferred a complaint under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (hereinafter referred
to as "N.I. Act" for the sake of brevity) against the applicants before the learned trial court alleging
there in that the applicant no.2 and other co-accused persons contacted him on behalf of the
Company for the purpose of sale of hotel and authorized him to deal for the sale of it and agreed to
pay Rs.10 Crores as a fee for the services to be rendered by him vide alleged Memorandum of
Understanding (Annexure No.4) (hereinafter referred to as "MoU" for the sake of brevity) which was
executed between them. It has been further alleged in the aforesaid complaint that in lieu of the
services rendered by the complainant, the accused issued two account payee cheques, which were
dishonored, as such, the accused are liable to be prosecuted for committing the offence under
Section 406, 420 I.P.C. as well as Section 138 of N.I. Act. It was also alleged by the opposite party
No.2 that an authorization-cum-declaration letter dated 14.08.2020 was issued by the Director
(Vishnu Kumar Pandey) of applicant No.1 Company in favour of opposite party No.2 (Annenxure
No.5).
6. Learned counsel for the applicants further submitted that the opposite party no.2 submitted his
statement on affidavit under Section 145(1) of N.I. Act read with Section 200 Cr.P.C. which is
nothing but the reiterated version of the complaint made by the opposite party No.2 against the
applicants.
7. Learned counsel for the applicants further submitted that on perusal of the authorization letter
dated 14.08.2020, it would reveal that the alleged authorization letter as claimed by the opposite
party No.2 has been issued for the specific time period of 15 working days i.e. from 16.08.2020 till
30.08.2020 and there is no averment in the complaint made by the opposite party No.2 that the said
letter has been extended further. He further submitted that there was no debt on the date
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187617633/ 2Mehrab Logistics And Aviation Ltd. ... vs State Of U.P. Thru. Prin. Secy. Home Lko ... on 13 February, 2024
24.06.2021 when the alleged cheques were issued as admittedly the sale of the hotel took place on
12.07.2021. It is admitted case of the complainant that the alleged authorization letter has not been
issued by the applicant no.2, who being a Managing Director is solely authorized to issue any such
letter on behalf of the Company.
8. Learned Counsel for the applicants further submitted that the alleged two cheques which were
stolen/misplaced from the possession of the applicant Company were reported to be lost by an
employee of the applicant Company, namely-Raghuvir Prasad, who reported about the lost cheques
to the concerned police station but the veracity of the aforesaid report was denied by police vide
letter dated 02.12.2022, wherein it has been specifically stated that no such G.D. Entry was found in
the concerned police station about the report for lost cheques. He further submitted that even the
police has denied the report regarding lost cheques, thus, it appears that the alleged cheques were
handed over to the complainant with the connivance of an employee of the applicant Company only
with the intention to misappropriate the alleged cheques.
It is further argued that even though the alleged MoU was prepared as a draft, the same was only
communicated through e-mail, which was neither signed by any of the parties nor any stamp or seal
of the company was appended on it nor there is any date. An unsigned, unstamped, undated draft
MoU/any agreement without payment of any stamp duty is inadmissible as a piece of evidence in
the eyes of law.
9. Learned counsel for the applicants further submitted that the complainant has neither disclosed
his own credentials or his alleged proprietorship firm "KBJ Engineering Services" such as PAN
No./GSTIN No./Income Tax Returns so as to ascertain his capacity to crack the claimed deal of sale.
10. Learned counsel for the applicants further submitted that the complainant somehow got
handover to the two blank cheques of the company with the connivance of an employee of the
applicants' Company and thereafter, conspired to extract the money from the company illegally as
he also knew that the hotel property is being sold. The complainant in furtherance of the aforesaid
criminal conspiracy and evil design, presented the aforesaid lost two cheques before the State Bank
of India, S.G.P.G.I. Branch, Lucknow on 24.06.2021 with forged signature of the applicant no.2 and
filling the self imagined amount of Rs.5 Crores in each cheque and entered the same date as
24.06.2021 on the aforesaid two cheques.
11. Learned counsel for the applicants further submits that in both the cheques, there was a note
present "valid upto Rs.50 lacs at non home branch" and on 14.07.2021, the aforesaid bank closed
the bank account of the applicant Company in view of the circular dated 06.08.2020 issued by
Reserve Bank of India, which prohibited the running of multiple current accounts in the same bank
and intimation regarding the same was given to the applicant company.
12. Learned Counsel for the applicants further submitted that when the opposite party No.2 got
those two blank cheques with the connivance of an employee of the applicant Company, he
presented the said two cheques by filling an imagined amount of Rs.5 Crores in each cheque to non
home branch as he knew that the aforesaid cheques will be dishonored by the Bank and the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187617633/ 3Mehrab Logistics And Aviation Ltd. ... vs State Of U.P. Thru. Prin. Secy. Home Lko ... on 13 February, 2024
applicant Company will be liable for an offence under the provisions of N.I. Act, even though, the
signatures of the applicant were forged and were made in the two cheques to falsely implicate the
applicant Company.
13. Learned Counsel for the applicants further submitted that despite the fact that the cheques
should have been returned by the bank with an endorsement at the memo that "exceeds
arrangement refer to drawer" or with the endorsement that the "same is unacceptable in the
S.G.P.G.I Branch, which is a non home branch", however, when the two alleged cheques were
presented in the bank the same were dealt in a most casual and mechanical manner and returned as
dishonored with the note of "insufficient fund" on the same day of being presented without
informing the applicant No.2.
14. Learned counsel for the applicants further submitted that the act/omission on the part of
concerned employees of the bank in issuing an incorrect bank return memo is illegal as well as
constitutes dereliction of duty resulting in false prosecution of the applicants as no offence under
Section 138 N.I. Act could have been made out against the applicant Company and therefore, the
connivance of the employee of opposite party No.3 cannot be ruled out. It is further submitted that
the act/omission on the part of the concerned bank employee has also caused irreparable damage to
the reputation and image of the applicant Company.
It is further argued that it is the admitted case of the complainant that no bill was ever raised in
discharge of the liabilities for which two alleged cheques were issued which casts suspicion over the
story of the complainant as a person/firm providing any service and charging the fee of Rs.10 Crores
is also liable for 18% GST/Service Tax which is a huge amount and cannot escape the eyes of tax
department. Further, argument of learned Counsel for the applicants is that it is fact of common
knowledge that the brokerage in any sale is paid in percentage and normally it is not more than 1%
of an astronomical amount that too about 25% of the forged value of property, which is not
believable.
15. Learned Counsel for the applicants further submitted that the two cheques of Rs.5 Crore
presented by the opposite party No.2 before the incompetent Bank who has no jurisdiction to
entertain the same as they were not presented at the Home Branch deliberately and even though the
cheques were issued on the same day but the signature on both the cheques were not similar and
there was complete mismatch. It was also argued that a forged signature was made on both the
cheques of the applicant No.2, who has also denied his signature on the aforesaid two cheques.
It is further argued that even though the signature which was done by the applicant No.2 in the sale
deed of Hotel and the signature shown in the two cheques are entirely different and has no
resemblance that also falsify the story of opposite party No.2.
16. Learned Counsel for the applicants further argued that the case under Section 138 of N.I. Act can
only be attracted in the Court if there exists any debt or the liability on the person who has issued
the cheque and in the present case, no debt or other liability exists on the applicants and the case
filed by the opposite party No.2 is false and fabricated and does not fall under the provisions of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187617633/ 4Mehrab Logistics And Aviation Ltd. ... vs State Of U.P. Thru. Prin. Secy. Home Lko ... on 13 February, 2024
Section 138 N.I. Act.
17. Learned Counsel for the applicants also argued that provisions of Section 68 of N.I. Act are also
not attracted in the present case as the there was no promisery note, bill of exchange or cheque
made, drawn or accepted payable at a specified place and not elsewhere must, in order to charge any
party thereto. Section 68 of N.I. Act is quoted hereinunder:-
"68. Presentment for payment of instrument payable at specified place and not
elsewhere.--
A promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque made, drawn or accepted payable at a
specified place and not elsewhere must, in order to charge any party thereto, be
presented for payment at that place."
18. Learned counsel for the applicants further submitted that the learned trial court did not conduct
any proper inquiry as envisaged under Section 202 Cr.P.C. for ascertaining the truth and veracity of
the allegations made in the complaint and for the purpose of deciding whether there exists sufficient
ground for proceeding against the applicants/accused and in a mechanical manner without
application of judicial mind, summoned the applicants/accused vide impugned summoning order
dated 22.07.2022.
19. Learned counsel for the applicants further submitted that the impugned order dated 22.07.2022,
by which the applicants were summoned, is also non speaking as the Magistrate has not considered
any material available before him while summoning the applicants to face the trial. As such, the
impugned order dated 22.07.2022 on the face of record appears to be unjustified and is passed
against the provisions of the N.I. Act , therefore, the same is liable to be set aside by this Court
alongwith the entire proceeding.
20. Learned counsel for the opposite party no.2 has opposed the argument raised by the learned
counsel for the applicants and submitted that in lieu of the MoU sent by the complainant to the
applicants vide email dated 08.10.2020, the applicant no.2 issued two post-dated cheques to the
complainant bearing nos.955800 and 955801 dated 24.06.2021 for Rs.5,00,00,000/- each as
security and ensured the complainant that if the payment of service fee is not made by the
applicants, the complainant can present the cheques for encashment. He further submitted that the
first advance payment in lieu of the sale of said hotel was made on 29.09.2020 and in part payments
all the sale amount of the Hotel was paid till June, 2021 but even after receiving the sale amount of
the said Hotel and repeated requests of the complainant to pay his service fee, the applicants did not
pay even a single penny to the complainant, thus, he submitted that the impugned summoning
order dated 22.07.2022 has been rightly passed by the learned trial court in accordance with law,
therefore, the same is not liable to be quashed and the instant application is liable to be rejected.
21. Learned A.G.A-I for the State also opposed the argument advanced by learned Counsel for the
applicants and submitted that the summoning order dated 22.07.2022 is rightly passed and no
interference by this Court is required in the instant matter.

22. After hearing learned counsel for the respective parties and after perusal of the materials
available on record, prima facie it appears that the learned trial court has failed to appreciate the
materials available on record and has committed manifest illegality while passing the impugned
order while summoning the applicants as the same is passed without considering the evidence
produced by the applicants, which is unsustainable in the eyes of law.
23. It is further observed that this Court is not the handwriting expert but prima facie on detail
examination and comparison of the respective signature samples, which were present on the sale
deed executed by the applicant No.2 in respect of sale of Hotel and the signatures which were
present on the two lost cheques, the cardinal principles of identification of signatures and on
comparing the writing habits, general and personal characteristics of both the sets of signature
samples and upon close scrutiny of the nature of the writing of the comparative signatures reveals
that the writing pertains to a good skilled writer capable of making forceful and crisp strokes in the
writing of complete signatures with no hesitation or clumsiness in stroke making. The writing is
found to be fluently and smoothly written in normal and natural flow of running signatures motion
without any care of caution.
24. It is further observed that there are dissimilarities in the signatures and sufficient amount of
dissimilarity is found. Cumulative consideration of all the dissimilarities in the writing habits
between the signature samples, which lead to a conclusion that the person who did the signature on
the sale deed executed in respect of sale of hotel and the signature which was present on the lost two
cheques are not the same person, who did the specimen signatures. This fact has also been
confirmed by a forensic expert, whose report is annexed as Annexure No.21 to the affidavit filed in
support of the present application.
25. It is observed earlier that this Court is not a handwriting expert, though, prima facie from bare
perusal of the cheques, both the signatures are different whereas, the cheques were issued on the
same date. It is further observed that on perusal of the signature on the sale deed, which was
executed by the applicants for sale of Hotel, wherein the signature of the applicant No.2 is present.
thus, it transpires that signatures on the cheques and signature on the sale deed are different, there
appears force in the argument of learned counsel for the applicants that the cheques were not signed
by the applicant No.2 and this fact has also not been considered by the trial court while passing the
impugned order.
26. It is further observed that though a case of breach of trust may be, both a civil wrong and a
criminal offence, but there would be certain situations where it would predominantly be a civil
wrong and may or may not amount to a criminal offence. The present case is one of that type where,
if at all, the facts may constitute a civil wrong but the ingredients of a criminal offences are wanting.
27. It is further observed that this is a very clear case of the parties entering into an agreement or
MoU, if any, and compounding the offence to save themselves from the process of litigation. When
such a step has been taken by the parties, and the law very clearly allows them to do the same, the
Courts then cannot override such compounding and impose its will.

On perusal of the authorization letter dated 14.08.2020, it would reveal that the alleged
authorization letter as claimed by the opposite party No.2 has been issued for the specific time
period of 15 working days i.e. from 16.08.2020 till 30.08.2020 and there is no averment in the
complaint made by the opposite party No.2 that the said letter has been extended further. He
further submitted that there was no debt on the date 24.06.2021 when the alleged cheques were
issued as admittedly the sale of the Htoel took place on 12.07.2021. It is admitted case of the
complainant that the alleged authorization letter has not been issued by the applicant no.2, who
being a Managing Director is solely authorized to issue any such letter on behalf of the Company,
thus, there exists no debt or liability upon the applicants.
28. Further, on perusal of Section 138 N.I. Act which reveals that it is a penal provision, it must,
therefore, be construed strictly, section 138 (2) enacting part of the provision makes it abundantly
clear that what constitutes an offence punishable with imprisonment and/or fine is the dishonour of
a cheque for insufficiency of funds, etc in the account maintained by the drawer with the bank for
discharge of a debt or other liability whether in full or part. The language used in the provision is
unambiguous and the ingredients of the offence clearly discernible namely (a) cheque is drawn by
the accused on an account maintained by him with a banker, (b) the cheque amount is in discharge
of a debt or liability, and (c) the cheque is returned unpaid for insufficiency of funds or that the
amount exceeds the arrangement made with the bank. Any dishonour falling within the four corners
of the enacting provision would be punishable without much ado.
Section 138 is structured in two parts, the primary and the provisory. The contents of the proviso
place conditions on the operation of the main provision, while it does not form a constituent of the
crime itself, it modulates or regulates the crime in circumstances where,unless its provisions are
complied with, the already committed crime remains impervious to prosecution.
The cause of action for prosecution will arise only when the period stipulated in the proviso elapses
without payment. Ingredients of the offence have got to be distinguished from the conditions
precedent for valid initiation of prosecution. The stipulations in the proviso must also be proved
certainly before the offender can be successfully prosecuted. But in the strict sense they are not
ingredients of the deemed offence under the body of Section 138 of the N.I. Act, though the said
stipulations must also be proved to ensure and claim conviction. It is in this sense that it is said that
the proviso does not make or unmake the offence under Section 138 of the NI Act. That is already
done by the body of the sections.
29. Further, Hon'ble the Supreme Court in case of Indus Airways Private Limited and Others Vs.
Magnum Aviation Private Limited and others; (2014) 12 SCC 539 in para 9 has held as under:-
"13. The explanation appended to Section 138 explains the meaning of the expression
'debt or other liability' for the purpose of Section 138. This expression means a legally
enforceable debt or other liability. Section 138 treats dishonoured cheque as an
offence, if the cheque has been issued in discharge of any debt or other liability. The
explanation leaves no manner of doubt that to attract an offence under Section 138,
there should be legally enforceable debt or other liability subsisting on the date of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187617633/ 7Mehrab Logistics And Aviation Ltd. ... vs State Of U.P. Thru. Prin. Secy. Home Lko ... on 13 February, 2024
drawal of the cheque. In other words, drawal of the cheque in discharge of existing or
past adjudicated liability is sine qua non for bringing an offence under Section 138. If
a cheque is issued as an advance payment for purchase of the goods and for any
reason purchase order is not carried to its logical conclusion either because of its
cancellation or otherwise, and material or goods for which purchase order was placed
is not supplied, in our considered view, the cheque cannot be held to have been
drawn for an exiting debt or liability. The payment by cheque in the nature of
advance payment indicates that at the time of drawal of cheque, there was no existing
liability."
30. Further, the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of B. Krishna Reddy Vs. Syed Hafeez (Died) Per
Legal Representative Naseema Begum and Another; (2020) 17 SCC 488 and in paragraph 8 and 9 of
the aforesaid judgment was pleased to observe as under:-
"8. In our view, the offence alleged was that a cheque was given towards
consideration for purchase of a property. Neither any document was produced on
record nor there was any evidence that any conveyance was executed in favour of the
appellant. Thus, the submission of the appellant that there was no existing debt or
liability against which the cheque was given had to be accepted. In our view, the High
Court was in error in accepting the appeal and upsetting the view taken by the Trial
Court.
9. We, therefore, allow this appeal, set-aside the decision of the High Court and
restore the judgment and order of acquittal passed by the Trial Court."
31. In the case of Meters and Instruments Private Limited v. Kanchan Mehta 1, the Hon'ble Apex
Court held that the nature of offence under section 138 of the N.I. Act, is primarily related to a civil
wrong and has been specifically made a compoundable offence. The relevant paragraph of the
judgment has been extracted herein:
"This Court has noted that the object of the statute was to facilitate smooth
functioning of business transactions. The provision is necessary as in many
transactions' cheques were issued merely as a device to defraud the creditors.
Dishonor of cheque causes incalculable loss, injury and inconvenience to the Vide the
Banking, Public Financial Institutions and Negotiable Instruments Laws
(Amendment) Act, 1988 payee and credibility of business transactions suffers a
setback. At the same time, it was also noted that nature of offence under Section 138
primarily related to a civil wrong and the 2002 amendment specifically made it
compoundable."
32. Further, a three Judge Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Dashrath Rupsingh Rathod Vs. State
of Maharashtra, 2014(9) SCC 129 in para 58 held as follows:
"58. To sum up:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187617633/ 8Mehrab Logistics And Aviation Ltd. ... vs State Of U.P. Thru. Prin. Secy. Home Lko ... on 13 February, 2024
58. 1. An offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 is
committed no sooner a cheque drawn by the accused on an account being maintained
by him in a bank for discharge of debt/liability is returned unpaid for unsufficiency of
funds or for the reason that the amount exceeds the arrangement made with the
bank.
58.2. Cognizance of any such offence is however forbidden under Section 142 of the
Act except upon a complaint in writing made by the payee or holder of the cheque in
due course within a period of one month from the date the cause of action accrues to
such payee or holder under clause (c) of proviso to section 138.
58.3. The cause of action to file a complaint accrues to a complainant/payee/holder
of a cheque in due course if:
(a) the dishonoured cheque is presented to the drawee bank within a period of six
months from the date of its issue.
(b) if the complainant has demanded payment of cheque amount within thirty days of
receipt of information by him from the bank regarding the dishonour of the cheque,
and
(c) if the drawer has failed to pay the cheque amount within fifteen days of receipt of
such notice.
58.4. The facts constituting cause of action do not constitute the ingredients of the offence under
Section 138 of the Act.
58.5. The proviso to section 138 simply postpones/defers institution of criminal proceedings and
taking of cognizance by the court till such time cause of action in terms of clause (c) of the proviso
accrues to the complainant.
58.6. Once the cause of action accrues to the complainant, the jurisdiction of the court to try the
cause will be determined by reference to the place where the cheque is dishonoured."
The ratio of Dashrath Rupsingh Rathod case was followed by a subsequent three Judge Bench in
Vinay Kumar Shailendra Vs. Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee and another, 2014(10) SCC
708.
33. It is further observed that the trial court while summoning the applicants by impugned order has
totally failed to appreciate the factual and legal aspect of the matter. The legal position is well-settled
that when a prosecution at the initial stage is asked to be quashed, the test to be applied by the court
is as to whether the uncontroverted allegations as made prima facie establish the offence. It is also
for the court to take into consideration any special features which appear in a particular case to
consider whether it is expedient and in the interest of justice to permit a prosecution to continue.

This is so on the basis that the court cannot be utilised for any oblique purpose and where in the
opinion of the court chances of an ultimate conviction is bleak and, therefore, no useful purpose is
likely to be served by allowing a criminal prosecution to continue, the court may while taking into
consideration the special facts of a case also quash the proceeding even though it may be at a
preliminary stage.
34. Further the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case Inder Mohan Goswami v. State of
Uttaranchal (2007)12 SCC 1 has held that it would be relevant to keep into mind the scope and
ambit of section 482 Cr.PC and circumstances under which the extra ordinary power of the court
inherent therein as provisioned in the said section of the Cr.P.C. can be exercised, para 23 is being
quoted here under:-
"23. This court in a number of cases has laid down the scope and ambit of courts
powers under section 482 Cr.P.C. Every High Court has inherent power to act ex
debito justitiae to do real and substantial justice, for the administration of which
alone it exists, or to prevent abuse of the process of the court. Inherent power under
section 482 Cr.P.C. can be exercised:
(i) to give effect to an order under the Code;
(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of court, and
(iii) to otherwise secure the ends of justice."
35. Further Hon'ble the Supreme Court of India in the case of Lalankumar Singh and Others vs.
State of Maharashtra reported in 2022 SCC Online SC 1383 has specifically held in paragraph No.38
that the order of issuance of process is not an empty formality. The Magistrate is required to apply
his mind as to whether sufficient ground for proceeding exists in the case or not. Paragraph No.38 of
Lalankumar Singh and Others (supra) is being quoted hereunder:-
"38. The order of issuance of process is not an empty formality. The Magistrate is
required to apply his mind as to whether sufficient ground for proceeding exists in
the case or not. The formation of such an opinion is required to be stated in the order
itself. The order is liable to be set aside if no reasons are given therein while coming
to the conclusion that there is a prima facie case against the accused. No doubt, that
the order need not contain detailed reasons. A reference in this respect could be
made to the judgment of this Court in the case of Sunil Bharti Mittal v. Central
Bureau of Investigation, which reads thus:
"51. On the other hand, Section 204 of the Code deals with the issue of process, if in
the opinion of the Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence, there is sufficient
ground for proceeding. This section relates to commencement of a criminal
proceeding. If the Magistrate taking cognizance of a case (it may be the Magistrate
receiving the complaint or to whom it has been transferred under Section 192), upon
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/187617633/ 10Mehrab Logistics And Aviation Ltd. ... vs State Of U.P. Thru. Prin. Secy. Home Lko ... on 13 February, 2024
a consideration of the materials before him (i.e. the complaint, examination of the
complainant and his witnesses, if present, or report of inquiry, if any), thinks that
there is a prima facie case for proceeding in respect of an offence, he shall issue
process against the accused.
52. A wide discretion has been given as to grant or refusal of process and it must be
judicially exercised. A person ought not to be dragged into court merely because a
complaint has been filed. If a prima facie case has been made out, the Magistrate
ought to issue process and it cannot be refused merely because he thinks that it is
unlikely to result in a conviction.
53. However, the words "sufficient ground for proceeding" appearing in Section 204
are of immense importance. It is these words which amply suggest that an opinion is
to be formed only after due application of mind that there is sufficient basis for
proceeding against the said accused and formation of such an opinion is to be stated
in the order itself. The order is liable to be set aside if no reason is given therein while
coming to the conclusion that there is prima facie case against the accused, though
the order need not contain detailed reasons. A fortiori, the order would be bad in law
if the reason given turns out to be ex facie incorrect."
36. Further, Hon'ble the Supreme Court of India has provided guidelines in case of State of Haryana
Vs. Bhajan Lal reported in 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335 for the exercise of power under Section 482
Cr.P.C. which is extraordinary power and used separately in following conditions:-
"102.(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint,
even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima
facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused."
(2) where the allegations in the First Information Report and other materials, if any, accompanying
the F.I.R. do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police officers under
Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section
155(2) of the Code;
(3) where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or 'complaint and the evidence collected
in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against
the accused;
(4) where the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a
non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a
Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the Code;
(5) where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on
the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground
for proceeding against the accused;

(6) where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the
concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance
of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act,
providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party;
(7) where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding
is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a
view to spite him due to private and personal grudge."
37. Further the Apex Court has also laid down the guidelines where the criminal proceedings could
be interfered and quashed in exercise of its power by the High Court in the following cases:- (i) R.P.
Kapoor Vs. State of Punjab, AIR 1960 S.C. 866, (ii) State of Bihar Vs. P.P. Sharma, 1992 SCC
(Crl.)192, (iii) Zandu Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. Vs. Mohd. Saraful Haq and another, (Para-10)
2005 SCC (Cri.) 283 and (iv) Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of Maharashtra, AIR 2021
SC 1918.
38. In S.W. Palankattkar & others Vs. State of Bihar, 2002 (44) ACC 168, it has been held by the
Hon'ble Apex Court that quashing of the criminal proceedings is an exception than a rule. The
inherent powers of the High Court itself envisages three circumstances under which the inherent
jurisdiction may be exercised:-(i) to give effect an order under the Code, (ii) to prevent abuse of the
process of the court ; (iii) to otherwise secure the ends of justice. The power of High Court is very
wide but should be exercised very cautiously to do real and substantial justice for which the court
alone exists.
39. Thus, in view of the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court and the facts and circumstances, as
narrated above and from the perusal of the record, the impugned summoning order dated
22.07.2022 passed in Complaint Case No.83520 of 2021, under Section 138 N.I. Act, Police Station
P.G.I., District Lucknow and the entire proceeding are against the spirit and directions issued by the
Hon'ble Apex Court and are liable to be set aside.
40. Accordingly, the impugned summoning order dated 22.07.2022 passed by Presiding Officer,
Additional Court No.10, Lucknow in Complaint Case No.83520 of 2021, under Section 138 N.I. Act,
Police Station P.G.I., District Lucknow and the entire proceeding pending before the Presiding
Officer, Additional Court No.10, Lucknow is hereby set aside and reversed and the matter is
remanded back to the trial court. Learned trial court concerned is directed to pass a fresh order
within four months from today, keeping in view the discussions/observations and judgments of
Hon'ble the Apex Court referred above.
41. For the reasons discussed above, the instant application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is allowed in
respect of the instant applicants.
42. Learned Senior Registrar of this Court is directed to transmit a copy of this order to the trial
court concerned for its necessary compliance.
