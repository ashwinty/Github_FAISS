THE HONOURABLE THE CHIEF JUSTICE SHRI.V.GOPALA GOWDA AND THE HONOURABLE
SHRI JUSTICE B.N.MAHAPATRA Date of hearing : 16.11.2010 : Date of Judgment : 19.01.2011 B.N.
MAHAPATRA, J. This Writ Petition has been filed with a prayer to strike down sub-Section (2) of
Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (for short, 'Act, 1986') as well as Rule 9A of the
Consumer Protection Rules, 1987 (for short, 'Rules, 1987'), as inserted/amended by the Consumer
Protection (Amendment) Rules, 2004; and the Consumer Protection (Second Amendment) Rules,
2005 (Annexure-3), on the ground that the same are un- constitutional, invalid and illegal; and pass
any other orders as deemed just and proper.
2. This petition is in the nature of a Public Interest Litigation seeking protection of rights and
interest of the consumers of the society. Petitioner No.1 is a registered voluntary consumer
organization and has been working since 1983 for protecting the rights and welfare of the consumers
of the country seeking remedy and justice for them. It is also working for growth of consumer
movement in the country to build up a healthy civil society. Petitioner No.2 is a conscious consumer
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45896534/ 1Orissa Consumers' Association vs Unknown on 19 January, 2011
working for the welfare, betterment of the citizens of the country and advancing for growth of
consumers' increment.
3. Mr. K.N.Jena, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioner submitted that the Act, 1986
was enacted with the object and purpose to provide better protection and promotion of consumers'
interest and rights in the society. It is a social welfare legislation and was an important milestone in
the history of consumer movement in the country to save the millions of illiterate, ignorant,
unorganized, poor and helpless consumers which constitute 90% of the total population of the
country from exploitation, cheating, unfair and restricted trade practice adopted by manufacturers,
traders and service providers. Further, the object of the Act, 1986 is to provide and secure
inexpensive and speedy justice to the consumers by setting up three tier redressal agencies, i.e.,
District Forums, Commissions at State and National levels adopting simplified procedure.
Unfortunately, without making the Act, 1986 more effective and beneficial for the common men who
are economically backward, some amendments in the said Act and Rules have been brought to
deprive and deny justice to the consumers. Section 12 of the Act, 1986 has been substituted by the
Amendment Act of 2002 (Act of 62 of 2002) inserting therein that every complaint shall be
accompanied with such amount of fees payable in such manner as may be prescribed. Charging of
fees for filing the complaint and amendment of Section 12 to that extent is contrary to the basic
structure as well as the object and the purpose of the Act. With a view to provide justice to poor and
economically backward class of the people of different castes and tribes and women, the State
Government as well as the Central Government has enacted laws to exempt them from paying the
court fee, whereas a person who is purchasing one Kg. of rice or atta or a match box or a dot pen/
pack of bread/ tooth brush/ plain paper, pencil etc. or any other goods and services worth of a
meager amount or less than a rupee is required to pay minimum fee of Rs.100/- and also to pay
registered postal charge of Rs.25/-. The poor consumer is also required to pay for service of notice to
each one of the opposite parties as State Government is not providing funds for service of notice to
opposite parties on the plea of financial crunch. Thus, payment of fees on complaint petition is
discriminatory, arbitrary and unreasonable. The petitioners strongly believe that unscrupulous
traders and influential businessmen, manufacturers, service providers are manipulating and
managing the helm of affairs for bringing out such amendment. Because of charging of the fees for
filing complaint petition before the Consumer Forums, the poor people will not be able to file
complaints for claiming damages though they are being cheated and exploited by the manufacturers,
sellers of goods and service providers, as a result of which the number of cases is reducing
day-by-day and thereby the retired persons, who are rehabilitated and appointed as Members of
Forums and Commissions, are being maintained and paid without any work.
4. It is further submitted that after Section 12(2) of the Act, 1986 came into force with effect from
15.03.2003, the O.P. No.1-Central Government in exercise of its statutory power under Section 30 of
the Act, 1986 amended the Rules, 1987 by C.P.(Amendment) Rules, 2004, which came into force
with effect from 05.03.2004 inserting Rule 9A. Rule 9A was further amended by Consumer
Protection (Amendment) Rules, 2005 with effect from 10.02.2005. Rule 9A provides a slab which
varies from Rs.100/- to Rs.500/- on the basis of value of goods or services and the compensation
claimed. Payment of fees as per Section 12(2) read with Rule 9A is grossly discriminatory,
unjustified and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India as well as the directive principles of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45896534/ 2Orissa Consumers' Association vs Unknown on 19 January, 2011
the Constitution and as such liable to be struck down. Rule 9A further provides that the draft and
postal orders are to be drawn in favour of the Registrar of the State Commission payable at the place
where the State Commission is situated. A poor farmer of remote village in order to claim protection
under the Act has to undergo harassment, sufferings and incur expenses by running to the town
covering the distance to obtain crossed postal orders and bank draft and to pay commission thereon.
Before filing a complaint/ petition, he has to take the help and knowledge of some literate persons.
Most of the State Commissions of the country including the State of Orissa do not have any
Registrar. Thus, because of this amendment, a difficult/peculiar situation has arisen in filing
complaint before the District Consumer Forums in the State of Orissa. Narrating all these defects,
the petitioner-Association had written letters to O.P. No.1 on 09.04.2004 and 18.04.2004 with a
request to repeal the same, but till today no reply has been received from them nor the opposite
parties have taken any step to withdraw such amendment. It is vehemently argued that the said
Rules have not been framed in accordance with law and therefore, it is liable to be declared as
illegal. The impugned amendment has been made in violation of Section 31 of the Act, 1986 and
procedure and provisions of Section 23 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. O.P. No.1 issued a public
notice which was published in "The New India Express", a daily English newspaper on 02.01.2005
inviting the voluntary consumer organizations, other bodies and public of the country to offer their
views/ suggestions/comments for amendment of the existing provisions in the C.P. Rules within
thirty days of such publication for the benefit the consumers. In response to such notice, the
petitioner-Association submitted suggestions and comments by letter dated 27.01.2005
(Annexure-5) and also by mail. Without considering the suggestions and comments of the public
and voluntary consumers' organizations including the petitioner Association the impugned Rule has
been enacted and enforced. Section 31 of the Act, 1986 mandatorily requires that every rule and
regulation made under the said Act shall be laid before the Houses of the Parliament. Rule 9A
provides that complainants, who are below the poverty line and holding Antodoya Anna Yojana (for
short, 'AAY') cards, are exempted from paying any fees for filing complaint, and no other
complainants of the same category are exempted from paying court fees which is violative of Article
14 of the Constitution of India.
5. Concluding his argument, Mr. Jena, learned Senior Advocate prayed for striking down
sub-Section (2) of Section 12 of the Act, 1986 and Rule 9A of the Rules, 1987 as inserted/amended
by the C.P. Amendment Rules, 2004 and further amended by the C.P. (Second Amendment) Rules,
2005 (Annexure-3).
6. Per contra, Mr.S.D.Das, learned Asst. Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the opposite
parties submitted that the power given to the Central Government to make rules under the
provisions of Section 30 of the Act, 1986 is not subject to condition of the Rules or byelaws being
made after previous publication. Therefore, the condition of publishing the draft of the proposed
Rules or byelaws for the information of persons likely to be affected thereby does not apply. It is
further submitted that Section 31(1) of the Act, 1986 provides that the Rules made under the
provisions of the Act, 1986 have to be laid before the Parliament and accordingly the Department of
Consumer Affairs, Government of India had taken necessary action in the matter and after due
authentication by the then Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution,
requisite copies of the Notification in English and Hindi were sent on 09.06.2004 requesting Lok
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45896534/ 3Orissa Consumers' Association vs Unknown on 19 January, 2011
Sabha and Rajya Sabha for laying the papers on the table of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. As per
bulletins of Lok Sabha dated 09.05.2005 and Rajya Sabha dtd. 06.05.2005 the C.P. (Second
Amendment) Rules, 2005 published in Notification No.GSR64(E) in the Gazette of India on
10.02.2005 was laid on the tables of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha in terms of Section 31 of the Act,
1986. In order to check frivolous and bogus applications, the provisions of Section 12(2) were
enacted by the Parliament in their own competency. It is further submitted that an Act cannot be
labeled unconstitutional as charging of fees for filing of complaint is common practice which is
followed. In fact, conscious view was taken for charging fees for filing complaint in Consumer
Forums. Further, a graded structure of fees has been kept with the lowest amount of fees of Rs.100/-
for filing complaints in District Forum in respect of total value of goods and services/compensation
claimed up to Rs.1.0 lakh. Moreover, below the poverty line complainants, who are holders of AAY
cards are exempted from paying fees for filing complaint in District Forums in respect of total value
of goods/service and compensation claimed up to Rs.1.0 lakh. It would be clear from Annexure-4
that a general notice was issued calling for views, suggestions/comments on the Act, 1986 and
Rules, 1987 as amended in 2003. This is a general notification for comment and not for any
particular Section of the Act or any particular Rules. The letter of Government of Orissa giving
suggestions regarding amendment in the Rules, 1987 under AnnexureB/2 was sent in response to a
letter of this Department which did not call for any suggestion but was only addressed to all States
and Consumer Forums enclosing copy of the Gazette Notification regarding Rules, 2004 dated 5th
March, 2004 for information and necessary action.
7. On the above rival contentions, the questions that fall for consideration by this Court are as
follows:
(i) Whether the provisions contained in Section 12(2) of the Act, 1986 and Rule 9-A of
the Rules, 1987 as inserted/amended by the C.P. (Amendment) Rules, 1994 and the
Consumer Protection (Second Amendment Rules, 2005) (Annexure-3) defeat the
aims and objects of the Act, 1986, and therefore, are liable to be struck down?
(ii) Whether the provisions contained in Rule 9-A of the
Rules, 1987 as inserted/amended by the C.P.
(Amendment) Rules, 1994 and the Consumer Protection (Second Amendment)
Rules, 2005 are arbitrary and discriminatory in nature?
(iii) Whether Rule 9-A of the Rules, 1987 as amended by Consumer Protection
(Second Amendment) Rules, 2005 has been notified without following the statutory
provisions and thereby that provision is not valid?
8. To deal with the first question, it is necessary to know the aims and objects behind enacting the
Act, 1986 and Rules, 1987. The statement of objects and reasons of the Act, 1986 indicates that it has
been enacted to promote and protect the rights and interests of the Consumers and to provide them
speedy and inexpensive redressal of their grievance.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45896534/ 4Orissa Consumers' Association vs Unknown on 19 January, 2011
The apex Court in Lucknow Development Authority vs. M.K. Gupta, AIR 1994 SC 787, while
ascertaining the purpose of the Act, 1986, and the objective it seeks to achieve and nature of social
purpose it seeks to promote, held as follows:
"To begin with the preamble of the Act, which can afford useful assistance to
ascertain the legislative intention, it was enacted, 'to provide for the protection of the
interest of consumers'. Use of the word 'protection' furnishes key to the minds of
makers of the Act. Various definitions and provisions which elaborately attempt to
achieve this objective have to be construed in this light without departing from the
settled view that a preamble cannot control otherwise plain meaning of a provision.
In fact the law meets long felt necessity of protecting the common man from such
wrongs for which the remedy under ordinary law for various reasons has become
illusory. Various legislations and regulations permitting the State to intervene and
protect interest of the consumers have become a haven for unscrupulous ones as the
enforcement machinery either does not move or it moves ineffectively, inefficiently
and for reasons which are not necessary to be stated. The importance of the Act lies
in promoting welfare of the society by enabling the consumer to participate directly
in the market economy. It attempts to remove the helplessness of a consumer which
he faces against powerful business, described as, 'a network of rackets' or a society in
which, 'producers have secured power' to 'rob the rest' and the might of public bodies
which are degenerating into store house of inaction where papers do not move from
one desk to another as a matter of duty and responsibility but for extraneous
consideration leaving the common man helpless, bewildered and shocked. The
malady is becoming so rampant, widespread and deep that the society instead of
bothering, complaining and fighting for it, is accepting it as part of life. The
enactment in these unbelievable yet harsh realities appears to be a silver lining,
which may in course of time succeed in checking the rot."
9. The apex Court in Common Cause, A Registered Society Vs. Union of India & Ors., AIR 1993 SC
1403 held as follows:-
"The object of the legislation, as the Preamble of the Act proclaims, is 'for better
protection of the interests of consumers'. During the last few years preceding the
enactment there was in this country a marked awareness among the consumers of
goods that they were not getting their money's worth and were being exploited by
both traders and manufacturers of consumers goods. The need for consumer
redressal fora was, therefore, increasingly felt. Understandably, therefore, legislation
was introduced and enacted with considerable enthusiasm and fanfare as a path
breaking benevolent legislation intended to protect the consumer from exploitation
by unscrupulous manufacturers and traders of consumer goods. A three-tier fora
comprising the District Forum, the State Commission and the National Commission
came to be envisaged under the Act for redressal of grievances of consumers."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45896534/ 5Orissa Consumers' Association vs Unknown on 19 January, 2011
The apex Court in State of Karnataka Vs. Vishwabarathi House Building Co-op. Society & Ors., AIR
2003 SC 1043 held that the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act clearly demonstrate that it
was enacted keeping in view the long felt necessity of protecting the common man from wrongs
where for the ordinary law for all intent and purport had become illusory. In terms of the said Act, a
consumer is entitled to participate in the proceedings directly as a result whereof his helplessness
against a powerful business house may be taken care of.
10. Needless to say that the Act, 1986 is a social piece of legislation and the legislative intention is to
protect a consumer against the services rendered. The objective of such social welfare measures no
doubt is to provide better, efficient and cheaper justice to the people. The primary duty of the Court
while interpreting the provisions of such an Act is to adopt a constructive approach to achieve the
purpose of the Act. Any other interpretation that would defeat the very purpose of the Act is not
permissible in law.
11. In the above backdrop of the case, we have to examine whether section 12(2) of the Act, 1986 and
Rule 9-A of the Rules, 1987 as inserted/amended by C.P. (Amendment) Rules, 1994 and Consumer
Protection (Second Amendment) Rules, 2005 are contrary to the aims and objects for which the Act,
1986 is enacted?
12. At this juncture, it is necessary for us to know what is contemplated in Section 12(2) of the Act,
1986 and Rule 9-A of the Rules, 1987 which are under challenge. These provisions are reproduced
below:
Section "12. Manner in which complaint shall be made xxxx xxxx xxxx (2) Every
complaint filed under sub-section (1) shall be accompanied with such amount of fee
and payable in such manner as may be prescribed.
Rule "9A. Fee for making complaints before District Forum - (1) Every complaint
filed under sub-section (1) of section 12, sub-section (1) of section 17 and clause (a) in
sub-clause (i) of section 21 of the Act shall be accompanied by a fee as specified in the
table given below in the form of crossed Demand Draft drawn on a nationalised bank
or through a crossed Indian Postal Order drawn in favour of the President of the
District Forum, Registrar of the State Commission or the Registrar of the National
Commission as the case may be, and payable at the respective place where the
District Forum, State Commission or the National Commission is situated. (2) The
concerned authority referred to in sub-rule (1) shall credit the amount of fee received
by it into the Consumer Welfare Fund of the respective State and where such fund is
not established into the Receipt Account of the State Government and in the case of
the National Commission, to the Consumer Welfare Fund of the Central Government.
Sl. Total Value of goods or services and Amount of No. the compensation claimed fee
payable (1) (2) (3) District Forum (1) Upto one lakh rupees - For Nil complainants
who are under the Below Poverty Line holding Antyodaya Anna Yojana Cards (2)
Upto one lakh rupees - For Rs.100 complainants other than Antyodaya Anna Yojana

card holders.
(3) Above one lakh and upto five lakh Rs.200
rupees
(4) Above five lakh and upto ten lakh Rs.400
rupees
(5) Above ten lakh and upto twenty lakh Rs.500
rupees
State Commission
(6) Above twenty lakh and upto fifty lakh Rs.2000 rupees (7) Above fifty lakh and
upto one crore Rs.4000 rupees National Commission (8) Above one crore rupees
Rs.5000 (3) The complainants who are under the Below Poverty Line shall be
entitled for the exemption of payment of fee only on production of an attested copy of
the Antyodaya Anna Yojana cards".
(underlined for emphasis)
13. Even though the Act was enacted in the year 1986, Section 12(2) quoted above has been brought
into the statute by Consumer Protection (Amendment) Act, 2002 [Act No.62 of 2002] dated
17.12.2002. Thereafter, the Central Government in exercise of its statutory powers under Section 30
of the Act, 1986 has amended the C.P. Rules, 1987 by C.P. Amendment Rules, 2004, which came
into force on 05.03.2004 inserting Rule 9A. The said Rule 9A was further substituted by Consumer
Protection (Second Amendment) Rules, 2005 which came into force from 10th February, 2005. The
fee structure for filing complaint before the Consumer Forum was provided for the first time in the
said Rule 9A.
14. As stated above, the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is a social and economic piece of legislation,
which is directed to protect the interest of the consumers in the country. Its objective is to provide
better, efficient and cheaper justice to the people. It goes without saying that in our country a major
portion of the population is living below poverty line. It will be certainly difficult for a consumer who
is everyday struggling for his livelihood or managing his family with limited income, to pay Rs.100/-
for filing a complaint before the statutory forum under the Act, 1986 for value of the goods and
compensation. Therefore, initially when the Act, 1986 and Rules 1987 were enacted, no provision
was made for payment of any fees by the consumers for filing any complaint for value of the goods
and compensation in case of deficiency in service. This position remained unchanged till 2003,
when Section 12(2) was inserted in the Act, 1986 and Rule 9A was inserted/amended in the year
2004 and 2005 providing for payment of fees for filing a complaint before the Consumer Forums for
value of the goods and compensation in case of deficiency in service.
15. Now the question that has arisen is as to whether the insertion/amendment made in Section
12(2) and Rule 9A is justified?
It is well settled legal position that right of appeal is a creature of statute and while granting such
right, the legislature is competent to impose conditions, which are reasonable and does not defeat
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45896534/ 7Orissa Consumers' Association vs Unknown on 19 January, 2011
the very purpose of giving such right. The Constitution Bench of the apex Court in the case of Seth
Nanda Lal & Anr. Vs. State of Haryana and others, AIR 1980 SC 2097, held as under:
"The right of appeal is a creature of a statute and there is no reason why the
legislature while granting the right cannot impose conditions for the exercise of such
right so long as the conditions are not so onerous as to amount to unreasonable
restrictions rendering the right almost illusory."
In the instant case, the specific stand of opp. parties is that in order to check frivolous and bogus
applications, a conscious view was taken and the provisions of Section 12(2) were enacted by the
Parliament in their own competency.
16. Section 12(2) provides that every complaint filed under sub- Section (1) shall be accompanied
with such amount of fee and payable in such manner as may be prescribed and Rule 9A provides for
payment of fees of Rs.100/- to Rs.500/- before the Consumer Forum though granting exemption to
the complainants, who are holders of AAY cards. The provisions have to be read harmoniously.
Though it appears at first flush that the application has to be accompanied by such amount as
prescribed, it has to be read along with the exemption provisions. The requirement is for payment of
fees which is subject to exemption.
The apex Court in Sultana Begum vs. Prem Chand Jain (1997)1 SCC 373, held as follows:-
"10. The rule of interpretation requires that while interpreting two inconsistent, or,
obviously repugnant provisions of an Act, the Courts should make an effort to so
interpret the provisions as to harmonize them so that the purpose of the Act may be
given effect to and both the provisions may be allowed to operate without rendering
either of them otiose."
(Also see Election Commission of India vs. Telangana Rastra Samithi & Anr., 2010(8) Supreme 649)
Therefore, provisions of Section 12(2) of the Act, 1986 and Rule 9A of the Rules, 1987 do not defeat
the object of the Act.
17. The second question is as to whether the provisions contained in Rule 9A of the Rules, 1987 are
arbitrary and discriminatory in nature? The said rule provides for payment of fees ranging from
Rs.100/- to Rs.500/- for filing a complaint before the District Consumer Forum. No doubt, under
the said provision complainants, who are AAY card holders, are not required to pay any fee along
with their complaints/petitions. Thus, the object of the statutory provision is to exempt persons
below poverty line. But the provisions prescribing a particular mode for establishing it, i.e., holding
AAY Cards has to be treated as one of the modes to avail the exemption. Needless to say that a major
chunk of the population, whose financial condition is similar to or worse than the people holding
AAY cards do not possess the AAY cards. They may have to pay fees for the reason that they will not
be possessing AAY cards though they are similarly situated. We have therefore to read down the said
Rules to make them valid. Such reading down of a statute is permissible, since it is well settled that
the Court should make all efforts to sustain the validity of a statute, even if that involves reading its
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45896534/ 8Orissa Consumers' Association vs Unknown on 19 January, 2011
language down (vide G.P.Sing's Principles of Statutory Interpretation, 9th Edn., 2004, pp.496-503.)
The Doctrine of reading down or of recasting the statute can be applied in limited situations. It is
essentially used, firstly, for saving a statute from being struck down on account of its
unconstitutionality. The Courts, though, have no power to amend the law by process of
interpretation, but do have power to mend it so as to be in conformity with the intendment of the
legislature. Doctrine of reading down is one of the principles of interpretation of statute in that
process. A statute can be declared to be valid where any term has been used which per se seems to
be without jurisdiction, but can be read down in order to make it constitutionally valid by separating
and excluding the part which is invalid or by interpreting the word in such a fashion in order to
make it constitutionally valid and within jurisdiction of the legislature which passed the said
enactment, by reading down the provisions of the Act. (See Delhi Transport Corporation Vs. D.T.C.
Mazdoor Congress & Ors., AIR 1991 SC 101).
The apex Court in M.Pentiah & Ors. Vs. Muddala Veeramallappa & Ors, AIR 1961 SC 1107 held as
follows:-
"Where the language of a statute, in its ordinary meaning and grammatical
construction, leads to a manifest contradiction of the apparent purpose of the
enactment, or to some inconvenience or absurdity, hardship or injustice, presumably
not intended, a construction may be put upon it which modifies the meaning of the
words, and even the structure of the sentence...... Where the main object and
intention of a statute are clear, it must not be reduced to a nullity by the draftsman's
unskilfulness or ignorance of the law, except in a case of necessity or the absolute
intractability of the language used. Nevertheless, the courts are very reluctant to
substitute words in a Statute, or to add words to it, and it has been said that they will
only do so where there is a repugnancy to good sense." See Maxwell on Statutes (10th
ed.)p.229."
In Seaford Court Estates Ltd. v. Asher, 1949-2 All ER 155 at p.164, Denning L.J. said,
"when a defect appears a judge cannot simply fold his hands and blame the
draftsman. He must set to work on the constructive task of finding the intention of
Parliament........... and then he must supplement the written word so as to give "force
and life" to the intention of the legislature............ A judge should ask himself the
question how, if the makers of the Act had themselves come across this ruck in the
texture of it, they would have straightened it out? He must then do as they would
have done. A judge must not alter the material of which the Act is woven, but he can
and should iron out the creases."
Thus, the object of reading down is to keep the operation of the statute within the purpose of the Act
and constitutionally valid. Doctrine of reading down is, therefore, an internal aid to construe the
word or phrase in a statute to give reasonable meaning.
Therefore, if the complainant produces attested copy of any other documentary evidence e.g.
certificate or card like APL/BPL or any other similar card issued by any Government functionary
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45896534/ 9Orissa Consumers' Association vs Unknown on 19 January, 2011
authorized to issue such document then the exemption shall be available. The provisions have to be
read down in the aforesaid manner.
18. Now the third question is as to whether before making amendment of Rule 9A of the Rules, 1987
by Consumer Protection (Second Amendment) Rules, 2005, vide Notification dated 10 th February,
2005, the procedures provided under the Statute have been followed or not. According to the
petitioner, such amendments have been brought in violation of Section 23 of the General Clauses
Act which provides for previous publication. The further case of the petitioner is that the said
amendments have been made in contravention of mandatory provisions of Section 31 of the Act,
1986 which requires that the said amendment should be laid before both the Houses of the
Parliament for a total period of thirty days prior to bringing those rules into force. On the other
hand, according to learned counsel for the opposite parties, Rule 9A has been brought into force in
exercise of the power under sub- section (1) of Section 30 of the Act, 1986 without violating the
procedures provided in the statute.
19. At this juncture, it is necessary to know what is contemplated in Sections 30(1) and 31(1) of the
Act, 1986 and relevant provisions Section 23 of the General Clauses Act. The same are reproduced
below:
Consumer Protection Act, 1986 :-
"Sec. 30(1) The Central Government may, by notification, make Rules for carrying
out the provisions contained in clause (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 2, clause (b) of
sub-section (2) of Section 4, sub-section (2) of Section 5, sub-section (2) of Section

"Sec. 31(1) Every Rule and every Regulation made under this Act shall be laid, as soon
as may be after it is made, before each House of Parliament, while it is in session, for

session or the succession sessions aforesaid, both Houses agree in making any
modification in the Rule or Regulation or both Houses agree that the Rule or
Regulation should not be made, the Rule or Regulation shall thereafter have effect
only in such modified form or be of no effect, as the case may be; so, however, that

General Clauses Act,1897:-
"Sec. 23. Provisions applicable to making of rules or bye-laws after previous
publication.-- Where, by any (Central Act) or Regulation, a power to make rules or
bye- laws is expressed to be given subject to the conditions of the rules or bye-laws

being made after previous publications, then the following provisions shall apply,
namely:-
(1) The authority having power to make the rules or bye-laws shall, before making
them, publish a draft of the proposed rules or bye-laws for the information of person
likely to be affected thereby...."
(Underlined for emphasis) Section 30 of the said Act empowers the Central
Government to make Rules by notification for carrying out certain provisions of the
Act including sub-section (2) of Section 12 of the Act, 1986. Thus, the Central
Government is empowered to make Rules by notification.
20. Section 31 of the said Act provides that every Rule and Regulation made under the Act, 1986
shall be laid, as soon as may be after it is made, before each House of the Parliament, while it is in
session, for a total period of thirty days which may be comprised in one session or in two or more
successive sessions, and if, before expiry of the session immediately following the session or the
successive sessions aforesaid, both Houses agree in making any modification in the Rule or
Regulation or both Houses agree that the Rule or Regulation should not be made, the Rule or
Regulation shall thereafter have effect only in such modified form or be of no effect, as the case may
be; so, however, that any such modification or annulment shall be without prejudice to the validity
of anything previously done under that Rule or Regulation. Thus, as per Section 31(1), the
Parliament has every power to modify or annul the Rules made by the Central Government in
exercise of the power under Section 31 of the Act, 1986.
21. In the present case, it is contended by the opposite parties that the Department of Consumer
Affairs, Government of India had taken necessary action in the matter and after authentication by
the then Minister of the State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, requisite copies of
the Notification in English and Hindi were sent on 09.06.2004 requesting the Lok Sabha and Rajya
Sabha Secretariat for laying the papers on the table of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. The opposite
parties further submitted that as per bulletins of Lok Sabha dated 09.05.2005 and Rajya Sabha
dated 06.05.2005, the C.P. (Second Amendment) Rules, 2005 was laid on the tables of both the
Houses of the Parliament.
Since it has been laid before both houses of the Parliament in terms of Section 31 of the Act, 1986
and no modification has been made or no opinion was expressed that it should not be given effect to,
the Rule has become operative.
22. The previous publication of draft of the proposed rules or bye-laws for the information of
persons likely to be affected thereby as provided in Section 23 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 has
no application to the present case as the Consumer Protection Act does not provide any such
condition.
23. In the result, the writ petition is allowed to the extent indicated in paragraph-17 above.
