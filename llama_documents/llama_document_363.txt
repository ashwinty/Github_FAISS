JUDGMENT
Jyotirmay Bhattacharya, J.
1. This appeal is directed against the judgment and decree dated 11th October, 1985, passed by the
learned Judge, VII Bench, City Civil Court at Calcutta in Ejectment Suit No. 391 of 1976.
2. The defendant (tenant) in a suit for eviction under the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act, 1956,
is the appellant before us.
3. The suit was filed by the plaintiff/respondent (landlord) for eviction of the tenant from the suit
premises on various grounds such as - (i) causing nuisance and annoyance to the plaintiffs and the
other occupants of the said premises and (ii) for violation of Clauses (m), (O), (p) of Section 108 of
the Transfer of Property Act.
4. The suit was ultimately decreed by the learned Trial Judge on the ground of violation of Clause
(p) of Section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act, as the learned Court below held that the
defendant/appellant raised permanent structure in the suit premises without consent of the
landlord.
5. The learned Trial Judge, however, found that the ground of eviction, i.e. causing nuisance and
annoyance to the plaintiffs and other occupants of the premises could not be established by the
plaintiffs. As such, no decree was passed on the said ground.
6. Mr. Ghosh, learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of the plaintiffs/respondents, made it
clear that he will restrict his submission to support the impugned judgment, so far as it relates to the
ground of eviction relating to violation of Clause (p) of Section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act.

In other words, the other ground of eviction, i.e. causing nuisance and annoyance to the plaintiffs
and the other occupants of the said building was practically abandoned by the
plaintiffs/respondents in this appeal.
7. It is also recorded herein that the plaintiffs/respondents have not filed any cross-appeal under
Order 41 Rule 22 of the Code of Civil Procedure for challenging the findings of the learned Trial
Judge regarding the said issue before us.
8. Under such circumstances, we will restrict our consideration with regard to the legality and/or
propriety of the judgment of the learned Trial Judge on the issue regarding violation of Clause (p) of
Section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act.
9. Admittedly, the defendant's tenancy which is the subject-matter of the suit, is a Flat consisting of
two rooms, a kitchen and store space with corrugated tin-sheet roof. The plaintiffs/respondents
allege that sometime in the month of September, 1975, the defendant/appellant most illegally and
unauthorisedly removed the said corrugated tin-sheet roof of the kitchen and store space and
replaced the same by cement concrete slab and thereby converted the tin-shade roof of the kitchen
and store space into permanent concrete roof and made a permanent brick-built passage from the
said kitchen and store space leading to the said concrete roof for the purpose of using it
unauthorisedly.
10. The plaintiffs further allege that this structural addition and alteration in the tenancy were made
by the defendant without the consent or permission of the plaintiffs or their authorised person and
as such, the defendant contravened the provisions of Clauses (m), (o), (p) of Section 108 of the
Transfer of Property Act.
11. The defendant contested the suit by filing written statement and additional written statement
denying the material allegations made in the plaint. Initially in the written statement, the defendant
denied such alleged illegal and unauthorised removal of the corrugated tin-shade from the roof of
the kitchen and store space and replacement of the same by concrete roof by the defendant and/or
the members of his family and thereby converting the tin-shade roof of the kitchen and store space
into permanent concrete roof.
12. Subsequently in the additional written statement, the defendant stated that the corrugated shade
required replacement as the same was worn out. The defendant further claimed that the defendant
repeatedly requested the landlord to repair and/or replace the said worn out corrugated tin-shade
and to change the rent receipt accordingly. The defendant further reiterated that the defendant did
not cause any addition or alteration in the suit premises in violation of any of the provisions
contained in Clauses (m), (o), (p) of Section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act.
13. Parties adduced their evidences in the suit in support of their respective contentions made out in
their aforesaid pleadings.

14. As a matter of fact, the PW- 1 being the constituted attorney of the plaintiffs, PW- 2 being the
Darwan of the plaintiffs, PW- 4 being another tenant of the said premises stated in their evidence
that in September, 1975, the defendant removed the tin-shade roof from the kitchen and store space
and replaced the same by cement concrete slab and also made a brick-built passage leading to the
roof of the said construction. PW- 1 and PW- 2 also in their evidence denied grant of any permission
by the landlord in favour of the tenant authorising him to raise such construction in the suit
premises. In fact, construction of the cement concrete roof on the kitchen and the store space also
was reported by the Advocate Commissioner being PW- 3 in his evidence.
15. The removal of the tin-shade from the roof of the kitchen and store space and replacement of the
same by cement concrete slab was not denied by the defendant in his evidence. The defendant,
however, in his evidence stated that such replacement was made by the landlord and such changes
were also reflected in the subsequent rent receipts issued by the landlord. The DW- 2 being another
tenant of the said premises who came to support the defendant, stated in his evidence that after
removal of the tin shade roof, wall was raised to some extent and a concrete roof was constructed on
that portion in the presence of the Darwan of the plaintiffs/respondents.
16. Considering the pleadings of the parties, the oral evidence of the respective parties on record as
well as the exhibits being Exhibits "2(a)", "2(b)" and "2(c)" whereby the defendant requested the
plaintiffs to repair the leakage of the roof of the tin shade and in default, the defendant himself will
cause such repair, the learned Trial Judge held that the defendant made permanent structure by
removing the tin-shade from the roof of the kitchen and store space and by replacing the same by
cement concrete slab, without the consent of the landlords in violation of Clause (p) of Section 108
of the Transfer of Property Act.
17. The learned Trial Judge held that it is hard to believe that the landlord would make the pucca
construction after removing the tin-shade for better convenience of the defendant/tenant and that
the landlord would give further amenity to the tenant by making a passage for going to the roof
through an outlet made on the pucca ceiling without enhancement of rent.
18. The learned Trial Judge further held that consent of the landlord regarding such construction by
the tenant cannot be inferred from the differences in the description of the suit premises in the rent
receipts being Exhibits 'A' and 'A1' as none of the said receipts was issued after the alleged
construction was made.
19. Thus, the learned Trial Judge passed the aforesaid decree of eviction against the appellant on the
grounds of violation of Clause(p) of Section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act.
20. The propriety of the said judgment is under challenge before us.
21. Mr. Banerjee, learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of the appellant, instead of
challenging the findings of the learned Court below regarding replacement of the tin-shade from the
roof of the kitchen and store space by cement concrete slab and making the brick-built passage for
going to the roof of the said concrete roof, canvassed before us that even if it is proved that such
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1313619/ 3Dayanand Gupta vs Gobind Lall Bangur And Ors. on 29 June, 2007
replacement was made by the defendant/appellant, still then the learned Court below was not
justified in passing a decree for eviction against the defendant/appellant inasmuch as replacement
of tin-shade by cement concrete slab does not amount to raising of construction of permanent
structure. According to Mr. Banerjee, construction of permanent structure means construction of
such structure on permanent basis which provides additional accommodation without causing
material impairment of value and utility of the tenancy.
22. Mr. Banerjee, thus, submitted that when the value and/or utility of the premises is not impaired
and the construction does not destroy and/or change the character, form and/or its identity, such
construction cannot be regarded as construction of permanent nature. By referring to the evidence
of PW- 1 in his cross-examination wherein PW-1 stated that the area now occupied by the defendant
as tenant, is still the same as it was at the time of inception of tenancy, Mr. Banerjee contended that
since the accommodation in the tenancy has not been enlarged by replacement of tin-shade by
concrete slab on the kitchen and the store space, such replacement cannot be regarded as
construction of permanent structure.
23. In support of such submission, Mr. Banerjee relied upon the following decisions of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court:
(i) (Om Prakash v. Amar Singh)
(ii) (Waryam Singh v. Baldev Singh)
24. Mr. Banerjee further submitted that violation of provisions of (m), (o), (p) of Section 108 of the
Transfer of Property Act, cannot be held to be proved, unless waste or damage due to such
construction is proved. In support of such submission, Mr. Banerjee relied upon a Full Bench
decision of our High Court in the case of Ratanlal Bansilal v. Kishorilal Goenka, para 156.
25. Mr. Banerjee further contended that waste and damages and impairment of value and utility
must not only be pleaded but also be proved in order to obtain a decree of eviction on the ground of
violation of Clause(p) of Section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act. By referring to the decision of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Waryam Singh v. Baldev Singh, paragraphs 15 and 16, Mr.
Banerjee submitted that in the absence of proof of material impairment of value and utility, Court
cannot pass any decree for eviction on ground of violation of Clause (p) of Section 108 of the
Transfer of Property Act.
26. Mr. Banerjee further submitted that when in spite of receiving the notice being Exhibit "2(c)"
wherein the appellant made it clear that in the event the landlord fails to repair the leakage in the tin
shade roof within seven days from the receipt of the said letter, the tenant himself will repair it at his
own cost, the landlord/respondent did not raise any objection to such repair by the tenant, the
landlord deemed to have waived his right to sue on the ground of violation of Clause (p) of Section
108 of the Transfer of Property Act. In support of such submission, Mr. Banerjee relied upon a
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court incase of B.L. Sreedhar and Ors. v. K.M. Munireddy (dead)
and Ors. reported in 2003(1) ICC (SC) page 778.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1313619/ 4Dayanand Gupta vs Gobind Lall Bangur And Ors. on 29 June, 2007
27. Mr. Banerjee, thus, concluded by submitting that the learned Trial Judge ought not to have
passed the decree for eviction on the grounds of violation of Clause (p) of Section 108 of the Transfer
of Property Act in the absence of any proof regarding impairment of value and utility of the suit
premises due to such alleged construction.
28. Mr. Ghosh refuted such submission of Mr. Banerjee by contending, inter alia, that impairment
of the value and utility of the suit premises and/or waste and damages caused by such construction
need not be proved in order to obtain a decree for eviction on the ground of violation of Clause (p) of
Section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act.
29. Mr. Ghosh contended that the decisions which were cited by Mr. Banerjee have no application in
the present case, as none of those decisions was delivered on the issue relating to violation of the
provisions of Clauses (m), (o), (p) of Section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act. Mr. Ghosh pointed
out from the decisions cited by Mr. Banerjee that all those decisions were passed on different
provisions of various rent control legislations which were not pari materia with the provisions of
Clause (p) of Section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act.
30. In Om Prakash v. Amar Singh's case (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court considered the
provision of Section 14 of U.P. Cantonments (Control of Rent and Eviction) Act, 1952 which
provides that - "No suit shall, without permission of the District Magistrate, be filed in any Civil
Court against a tenant for his eviction from any accommodation except on one or more of the
following grounds, namely; a)tob)xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxc) that the tenant has without the permission
of the landlord, made or permitted to be made any such construction as in the opinion of the Court
has materially altered the accommodation or is likely substantially to diminish its value."
31. Similarly in Waryam Singh's case (supra), the Hon'ble Supreme Court considered the provision
of Section 13(2)(iii) of the East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act, 1949 which provides that - "(2) A
landlord who seeks to evict his tenant shall apply to the Controller for a direction in that behalf. If
the Controller, after giving the tenant a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the
applicant, is satisfied-*************************** (iii) that the tenant has committed such acts as
are likely to impair materially the value or utility of the building or rented land."
32. Similarly, in the case of Om Pal v. Anand Swarup (dead) , the Hon'ble Supreme Court had the
occasion to consider the very same provision of East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act.
33. Mr. Ghosh, thus, contended that those decisions have no application in the present case.
34. Mr. Ghosh, however, relied upon a decision of our High Court in the case of Surya Properties
Pvt. Ltd. v. B. Nath, , wherein it was held that permanent structure for the purpose of Section 108
(p) will mean a structure which is capable of lasting till the term of the lease and which is
constructed in the way of being built up as a building.
35. Relying upon another Division Bench judgment of this Court in the case of Himanshu Bikash
Das v. Ramendra Mohan Dutta reported in 1991(1) CLJ 392, Mr. Ghosh submitted that if it is proved
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1313619/ 5Dayanand Gupta vs Gobind Lall Bangur And Ors. on 29 June, 2007
that the tenant raised unauthorised structure on the tenanted premises, but subsequently
dismantled the structure will not liquidate the ground envisaged in Section 13(1)(b) of the West
Bengal Premises Tenancy Act.
36. Thus, Mr. Ghosh supported the impugned judgment.
37. Let us now consider the respective contentions of the learned Advocate of the parties in the
present context.
38. In fact, permanent structure has not been defined under the Transfer of Property Act. As such,
we had to hunt up the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court as well as of our High Court to find
out the exact meaning of the expression "permanent structure" as mentioned in Section 108 (p) of
the Transfer of Property Act. This is very much necessary, as construction of every description is not
construction of permanent structure attracting the rigor of Section 108(p) of the Transfer of
Property Act.
39. As pointed out in a Division Bench decision of this Court in Dhanapati v. Geeta reported in
1986(2) CHN 292, it is not the law that a tenant cannot in any event construct any structure or make
any addition to or alteration of the tenanted premises without the consent of the landlord. A
combined reading of Clauses (o) and (p) of Section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act would rather
indicate that while the tenant cannot put up any construction by way of addition and alteration
which is a permanent structure or which is destructive or permanently injurious to the tenanted
premises, but he can within the limits of Clauses (o) and (p) of Section 108 of the Transfer of
Property Act, add to the premises and make alteration there, to suit his needs. That is precisely what
was pointed out in the Special Bench decision of this Court in case of Surya Properties Put. Ltd.
(supra).
40. It was held in the said decision that when structure has been so built so as to become part of the
single structure and are so attached to the old structure that its removal is bound to affect the whole
structure, it would become a permanent structure. Thus when any structure is constructed in such a
fashion, the removal of such construction without causing any damage to the structural strength of
the building, is not possible, such construction could be regarded as permanent construction.
41. Then again, what is meant by structure?
42. Construction of structure, no doubt means addition or alteration of accommodation. Thus when
there is no addition or alteration in the accommodation in the process of such construction; Court
cannot conceive of any construction of permanent structure. In fact, that is the view which was
precisely expressed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Om Prakash (supra).
43. Let us now apply the aforesaid test in the facts of the present case. We have indicated above that
here in the instant case, the defendant has simply replaced the tin-shade by the cement concrete
slab on the roof of preexisting kitchen and store space. The kitchen and the store space with tin
shade on its roof were there right from the commencement of the tenancy. Only the worn out
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1313619/ 6Dayanand Gupta vs Gobind Lall Bangur And Ors. on 29 June, 2007
tin-shade was replaced by cement concrete stab, By such replacement, the accommodation available
to the tenant is neither extended nor altered, as the floor space of the tenancy remains the same
even after such alteration.
44. Thus, such replacement cannot be regarded as construction of "permanent structure". Such
replacement can at best be regarded as an improvement of a part of the suit premises. As such, this
Court by relying upon a decision of the Division Bench of this Court in the case of Debikanandan v.
Harasundar reported in 1988(1) CHN 180 holds that no decree for eviction can be passed on the
ground of violation of Clause (p) of Section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act as improvement was
made by the tenant in the existing structure without enlarging and/or altering the extent of
accommodation in the suit premises.
45. Furthermore, the plaintiffs/respondents failed to prove that the construction of the roof by
cement concrete is affixed and/or annexed to main structure of the building to such an extent which
makes it impossible to remove without causing any damage to the main structure of the building,
46. Tims, relying upon the decision of this Court in the case of Surya Properties Pvt. Ltd. (supra) as
well as the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Om Prakash (supra), this Court
holds that removability test which is also a test for ascertaining the permanency of such
construction, has also not been applied by the learned Trial Judge while passing a decree of eviction.
47. It is, however, correctly pointed out by Mr. Ghosh that material impairment in value and utility
of the tenancy due to construction of permanent structure, is not a consideration for passing a
decree on the ground of violation of Section 108(p) of the Transfer of Property Act unlike in the
other rent control legislation as referred to above. But, still then this Court cannot ignore the
decision of the Full Bench of this Court in the case of Ratanlal Bansilal (supra) wherein it was held
in clear terms that unless a case of waste or damage is proved, it cannot be said that there is any
violation of Clauses (m), (o), (p) of Section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act. Proof of such waste
and damage due to construction of cement concrete roof on kitchen and store space and/or making
a brick-built passage for going to the roof thereof, is conspicuously absent in the present case. As
such, this Court is unable to maintain the decree passed by the learned Trial Judge.
48. Before concluding, we also feel it necessary to mention that in the case of Surya Properties Pvt.
Ltd. (supra) as well as in the other decision, viz., Himanshu Bikash Das (supra) which were cited by
Mr. Ghosh, we find that in those cases construction of kitchen with four brick-built walls with tin
shade roof and/or construction of a brick-built room on the roof of the suit premises were made by
the tenants extending the extent of their accommodation. Under such circumstances, Court held in
those decisions that the tenant was guilty of violating the provisions of Section 108(p) of the
Transfer of Property Act.
49. But here is the case, replacement of tin shade roof by cement concrete roof without extending
the extent of accommodation, cannot be regarded as construction of permanent structure. As such,
we cannot maintain the decree by applying the principles of those decisions which were cited by Mr.
Ghosh, as above.

50. Thus, after hearing the learned Advocates for the respective parties and after considering all
relevant materials, we find merit in the present appeal and the same is accordingly allowed.
51. The judgment and decree impugned in this appeal, are set aside and the suit for eviction filed by
the plaintiffs/respondents, is hereby dismissed.
52. There will be, however, no order as to costs.
53. Let the L.C.R. along with copy of this judgment be forwarded to the learned Trial Court
forthwith.
54. Urgent xerox certified copy of this judgment, if applied for, be supplied expeditiously after
complying with formalities.
Alok Kumar Basu, J.
