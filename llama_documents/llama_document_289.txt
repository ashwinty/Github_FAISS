ORDER
Swamikkannu, J.
1. These two revisions are presented to revise the order of the Tamil Nadu Tax Appellate Tribunal
(Main Branch), Madras and passed in T.A. Nos. 764 of 1977 and 164 of 1978 dated 23rd April, 1978,
holding that the auction sale of each lot of goods has to be construed strictly in accordance with
section 64(2) of the Sale of Goods Act, that the sale was complete at the time of the fall of the
hammer, that subsequent issue of C form and letter requiring despatch to Bombay cannot divert the
property from the buyer and revest it with the seller, that such concluded sales being in Madras, the
transactions are liable to tax under the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act, that the lower authorities
are correct in the stand they have taken, that the auctions in the year 1976-77 were also governed by
the same rules and that accordingly the sales in that year also liable to tax under the Tamil Nadu
General Sales Tax Act.
2. In respect of the year 1975-76, the revision petitioner reported a total turnover of Rs. 31,26,979.78
and taxable turnover of Rs. 23,40,489.91 under the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act. The Joint
Commercial Tax Officer, Rattan Bazaar Circle, who verified the accounts found the total turnover
reported to agree with the book figures. However, he did not accept the claim of inter-State sales on
a turnover of Rs. 7,86,491.00. He thus determined the taxable turnover at Rs. 31,26,980.00. It is
this disallowance of the claim of inter-State sales that has given rise for the appeal before the
Appellate Assistant Commissioner which was not successful and ultimately this appeal under
section 36 of the Act before the Tribunal.
3. In respect of the year 1976-77, the revision petitioner herein reported a total turnover of Rs.
80,13,922.00, and taxable turnover of Rs. 31,82,601.00 was disallowed by the assessing officer and
the taxable turnover was determined at Rs. 76,55,390.00. The revision petitioner filed first appeal
before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner (Commercial Taxes) II, Madras and as it was not
successful, the revision petitioner went on second appeal before the Tribunal. The disputed turnover
was, however, shown as Rs. 34,41,134.00 in the first appeal and Rs. 31,82,661.00 in the assessment
stage is Rs. 31,82,601.00.
4. The revision petitioner conducted auction sales of diamonds and industrial diamonds in Madras.
Some of the bidders in these auctions were dealers of Bombay. After successfully bidding in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 1National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
auctions and paying the necessary deposit amount, they had given letters to the Presiding Officer of
the auction, to despatch the diamonds to Bombay so that they could remit the balance amount to the
Bombay office of the revision petitioner and take delivery there. They also furnished C form to the
revision petitioner either on the same day of the auction or a few days later. The revision petitioner
classified such transactions as inter-State sales and claimed exemption on those sales in the Tamil
Nadu general sales tax assessment. But relying on one of the clauses in the rules governing the
auctions that on the fall of the hammer, the highest bidder shall be deemed to be the purchaser, the
assessing officer concluded that all the sales were local sales within the Madras State and disallowed
the claims of exemptions. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner besides agreeing with the reason
given by the assessing officer relied on one more rule in the auction rules according to which after
the payments of deposit amount of 25 per cent by the buyer, the diamonds would be put in a cover
which would be sealed by the Presiding Officer in the presence of the bidder noting the name of the
bidder and the buyer also has the option of affixing his own seal. He thus held that the sales were
only within the Madras State and were not inter-State sales.
5. The factual position examined by the authorities in the hearing before the Appellate Assistant
Commissioner evidenced that the parties issued a letter requiring movement and delivery of the
diamond lots at Bombay. The goods were sent by the revision petitioner to their nominees at
Bombay by insured registered postal parcel, and were cleared by the revision petitioner and held at
Bombay for considerable time. Monies were later settled by Bombay buyers at which point the
invoice of sale was handed over along with delivery challan. According to the revision petitioner, all
the ingredients of the sale took place at Bombay when the goods were delivered and property
passed. The revision petitioner reserved right to question even the very assessability under the
Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, considering that the sale itself took place only in Maharashtra State.
The parties to the contract have already endeavored to bring about inter-State sales for which the
buyers have issued C declarations. The revision petitioner collected Central sales tax. Thus the
intention of the seller and the buyer was clear from the above transaction. The revision petitioner
submits that the authorities had no material to arrive at a conclusion contrary to the basic intent of
the parties.
6. At the time of hearing, the learned counsel for the revision petitioner explained before the
authorities the procedure relating to the auctions conducted by the persons at Madras. He filed
copies of the rules governing the auctions for sale of gems and diamonds and the special
modification for rule 11 made temporarily in respect of the 55th diamond auction at Madras
commencing from 19th January, 1976. According to the revision petitioner, though by virtue of
section 64 of the Sales of Goods Act, in the case of sale by an auction, the sale will be complete when
the auctioneer announces the completion by the fall of the hammer, the rights, duties or liabilities
arising under a contract of sale by implication of the law may be negatived or varied by express
agreement or by course dealing between the parties. In the instant case, he pointed out that by
making a provision in rule 11, the revision petitioner acquired a right of canceling the sale if the sale
price is not paid in full. Similarly, the revision petitioner made a provision that the property in the
goods will be deemed to pass to the purchaser only after he had paid the outstanding dues in full and
physical delivery of the diamond was effected to him and until such delivery is made, the property in
the diamonds will continue to vest in the corporation. He thus pointed out that by the application of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 2National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
section 19 of the Sale of Goods Act, the property in the goods will be transferred to the buyer at such
time as the parties intend it to be transferred and when this provision is read along with auction
rules, property can be said to have been transferred only after the full payment of the price is paid
and when the goods are delivered to the buyer at Bombay. Thus according to the revision petitioner,
the appropriation of the goods was at Madras and the final delivery and sale was at Bombay and
accordingly there was an inter-State sale from Tamil Nadu to Maharashtra State. It is also
contended that in spite of an undertaking given by the buyers that the loss or damage in transit from
Madras to Bombay would be borne by the buyers and the corporation will not be liable to replace the
goods so lost or damaged, the property in the goods remained with the sellers; the provisions of
section 26 of the Sale of Goods Act would show that by specific agreement the risk alone can be
transferred to the buyer while property is retained by the seller himself. It is pointed out on behalf of
the revision petitioner that the condition regarding vesting of property in the auction rule will
prevail over the undertaking given by the buyers, in spite of risk. The next contention of the revision
petitioner is that by producing the carbon copies of the invoices that the first part of the invoice in
each case was drawn up at Madras on the date of auction itself and the second half of invoice was
completed at Bombay after realising the value and allowing the appropriate cash rebate varying with
reference to the promptness of payment and that is another indication of the sale being completed
in Bombay. By a special letter given, the buyers produced the C forms and according to the decision
in Glenrock Wood and Allied Enterprises v. State of Tamil Nadu [1975] 36 STC 316 (Mad.), the issue
of C forms is one of the indications of the intention of the parties to sell and to buy on inter-State
basis.
7. Mr. Bakthavatsalam, learned Additional Government Pleader, on behalf of the Revenue
contended, inter alia, that according to rule 7 of the auction rules, on the fall of the hammer the
highest bidder will be deemed to be the purchaser and he should pay in cash or by a demand draft a
deposit of 25 per cent of the purchase value. Again according to rule 10, the diamonds are put into a
packet and sealed by the Presiding Officer and the buyer is also entitled to affix his own seal on such
packets. These factors would show that the sale was already completed and the parties had merely
postponed the payment of the value and the delivery of goods which would not affect the earlier
transfer of property in the goods. As regards rule 11(iii) though there is a provision that the property
in the diamonds should be deemed to pass to the purchaser after he paid the outstanding dues in
full, the fact of allowing the buyer to affix the seal on the packet of the diamonds intended to him
would amount to a modification of the procedure in rule 11(iii). According to the learned Additional
Government Pleader, once the deposit amount of 25 per cent of the value is paid, the property is
passed to the purchaser by appropriation of goods which happens within the State of Tamil Nadu.
He further pointed out that according to rule 11(1)(a), 14 days time is allowed to the buyers for the
payment of the value and taking delivery of the goods. That is another indication to show that until
the 14 days time expires, the intention of the parties was to sell the goods and realise the value
within this State only. Learned Additional Government Pleader also points out that under sub-rules
(b) and (c) of rule 11 interest is charged from the buyers and this would mean that the value of the
goods was already fixed and the property in the goods passed to the customer and constructive
delivery was also completed. The goods were held by the revision petitioner only in the capacity of
an unpaid seller, and after realisation of the sale value along with interest due for payment, there
was only a redelivery of the goods which were once notionally delivered to the buyers. The issue of C
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 3National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
form on the date of auction itself would show that the sale was complete on the date of auction on
which date the goods were in this State and had not commenced movement from this State to the
State of Maharashtra. Thus according to the learned Additional Government Pleader, the sales were
only within the State.
8. Learned counsel for the revision petitioner, Mr. C. Natarajan, would further contend in his reply
that the buyer was allowed to affix seal on the packet of diamonds only for the purpose of
identification of the packet and not to indicate that he had already becomes the owner of the goods,
because the provision in the auction rules was to the effect that property would be passed only after
the payment is made and physical delivery is effected.
9. As regards the retention of goods for 14 days by the revision petitioner for delivery without
payment of interest, he explained that though it was possible for the buyers to take delivery within
the Madras State by paying the value (without any interest), in the instant cases, the intention of the
parties was quite different as the buyers had given letters that the goods be despatched to the
Bombay State and that they had issued C form for that purpose and would be agreeable to the rate of
tax at 4 per cent. As regards interest, he pointed out that that was only an incidental charge which
was agreed to by the parties and that by itself would not mean that the transaction was already
concluded on the date of auction. As regards constructive delivery, the learned counsel explained
that under the Sale of Goods Act, constructive delivery would take place only if something is done by
the seller to signify a delivery, for example by the issue of a delivery note. Learned counsel for the
revision petitioner pointed out that in the instant cases there was no issue of delivery note or any
other document signifying such constructive delivery and in fact the delivery note was issued only
after the full payment was received and when the actual delivery was given to the buyers. According
to the learned counsel for the revision petitioner there is absolutely no material on record to spell
out completed sales within the State of Tamil Nadu attracting the levy of tax under the Tamil Nadu
General Sales Tax Act.
10. The points for consideration in these two revision petitions are :
(1) Whether the Tribunal had committed an error in holding that the transactions are
not inter-State dealings and as such they come within the purview of the provisions of
the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act; and (2) Whether the revision petitioner herein
is liable to pay tax by virtue of the provisions of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax
Act.
11. We have carefully considered the arguments advanced on either side and also perused the
records in this case. The revision petitioner is the National Mineral Development Corporation
Limited, a Government of India undertaking, has a diamond mining project with two diamond
mines, in Panna, Madhya Pradesh. The diamonds won from these mines are periodically sold in
rough (uncut) form in auctions in various in the country. The date and venue of the auctions are
notified to the public through advertisements in leading newspapers. The notices are also sent to the
Diamond Merchants' Associations in various cities for circulation to its members. On the day of the
commencement of the auction, the merchants desirous of participating in the auction, register
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 4National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
themselves at the auction centre and obtain admit cards on payment of a refundable sum of Rs.
2,000 each. The diamond lots put up for auction are displayed at the auction centre for inspection
by the registered merchants. Before the commencement on inspection, the participating persons are
issued the rules governing the auction and the catalogues listing the items put up for inspection and
sale. Upon completion of inspection of the lots put on display, the said lots are taken up for auction.
The registered merchants present are invited to offer bids. After a bid is accepted by the Presiding
Officer and is knocked down, the successful purchaser is required to sign the bid register in token of
his agreement to purchase the concerned item and to pay security deposit of 25 per cent of the sale
value of the concerned items for which a receipt is issued to him. The lot for which the sum
representing 25 per cent of the value of the bid has been paid by the successful bidder, is sealed in
an envelope and signed by the Presiding Officer in the presence of the bidder. The bidder also puts
his own seal on the packet, if he desires to do so. The invoice is prepared forthwith indicating the
item number, the weight of the item, the price accepted and the total value and also the security
deposit amount paid by the successful bidder. From the 55th auction held in January, 1976 onwards,
the delivery of the diamond lots sold is made either at Madras or at Bombay on the basis of the
stipulation made by the bidder concerned as to whether the bid and purchase are subject to delivery
at Bombay on payment of Central sales tax, instead of at Madras. Delivery at Bombay is arranged
only in cases where the purchaser confirms in writing that the purchases made by him are subject to
delivery at Bombay. Deliveries at Madras during the course of the auction are made by the
corporation's representative on collection from the purchaser of the outstanding amounts due, i.e.,
the sale value plus NMDC service charges plus interest on the outstanding balance, if any due, plus
Tamil Nadu general sales tax and surcharge at the applicable rates minus security deposit which
would have been paid on the item being knocked down in his favour. For deliveries after the close of
the auction, the diamond lots, in sealed covers, are entrusted to the corporation's bankers who
deliver them to the concerned merchants on collection of the outstanding amounts due, within the
prescribed delivery period. For deliveries at Bombay, the diamond lots are sent by the corporation
by insured post parcels or as precious cargo by air, to its Bombay office for being placed in the bank
lockers there. The lots, in sealed covers are made over to the purchasers within the prescribed
delivery period, on the purchasers (a) depositing the outstanding amounts due i.e., sale value plus
NMDC service charges plus interest on the outstanding balance, if any due, plus Central sales tax at
the applicable rate, minus security deposit already paid and (b) submitting C form. On delivery of
the diamond lots in sealed covers to the purchasers, the original copy of the invoice with all the
entries made therein regarding sales tax, etc., and final receipt for the total amounts paid for the
item (a) in question are handed over to the purchaser along with the goods.
12. On these facts, let us now start discussing the questions that we have framed in these two
revision petitions.
13. According to section 64(2) of the Sale of Goods Act, the sale is completed when the auctioneer
announces its completion on the fall of the hammer or the other customary manner. The agreement
to sell and the passing of the property in the goods sold take place simultaneously. So far as our
country, India is concerned, the law regulating the auction sale has been codified in section 64 of the
Sale of Goods Act. Sub-section (1) shows that there is a contract of sale even in the case of auction
sales. Sale by auction, being a sale of specified goods, is complete when the offer is accepted and the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 5National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
auctioneer announces its completion by the fall of the hammer. That is the settled law.
14. Before actually looking into the facts in this case in the light of the arguments, let us incorporate
the provisions of sections 3 and 4 of the Central Sales Tax Act, and the relevant clauses in the
auction rules.
"3. When is a sale or purchase of goods said to take place in the course of inter-State
trade or commerce. - A sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed to take place in the
course of inter-State trade or commerce if the sale or purchase -
(a) occasions the movement of goods from one State to another; or
(b) is effected by a transfer of documents of title to the goods during their movement
from one State to another.
Explanation 1. - Where goods are delivered to a carrier or other bailee for transmission, the
movement of the goods shall, for the purposes of clause (b), be deemed to commence at the time of
such delivery and terminate at the time when delivery is taken from such carrier or bailee.
Explanation 2. - Where the movement of goods commences and terminates in the same State it shall
not be deemed to be a movement of goods from one State to another by reason merely of the fact
that in the course of such movement the goods pass through the territory of any other State.
4. When is a sale or purchase of goods said to take place outside a State. - (1) Subject to the
provisions contained in section 3, when a sale or purchase of goods is determined in accordance
with sub-section (2) to take place inside a State, such sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken
place outside all other States.
(2) A sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed to take place inside a State if the goods are within
the State -
(a) in the case of specific or ascertained goods, at the time the contract of sale is made; and
(b) in the case of unascertained or future goods, at the time of their appropriation to the contract of
sale by the seller or by the buyer, whether assent of the other party is prior or subsequent to such
appropriation.
Explanation. - Where there is a single contract of sale or purchase of goods situated at more places
than one, the provisions of this sub-section shall apply as if there were separate contracts in respect
of the goods at each of such places."
15. The contention of the revision petitioner herein is that by the rule governing the auction for sale
of off-colour and industrial diamonds, especially by rule 7, on the fall of the hammer the highest
bidder shall be deemed to be the purchaser and he shall pay in cash or through a demand draft on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 6National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
State Bank of India, Panna (M.P.), a deposit (for which a receipt will be granted to him) equivalent
to 25 per cent of the purchase value.
16. Rule 10 of the abovesaid rules contemplates that the diamond, or the packet of diamonds, for
which the sum representing 25 per cent of the value of the bid has been paid by the successful bidder
will be sealed in a cover by the Presiding Officer in the presence of the bidder. The bidder shall also
put his own seal on the packet. The packet so sealed will be numbered and the number will be
mentioned in the money receipt to be granted to the successful bidder for the particular purchase.
17. Rule 11. (i) For diamond tool manufacturers who are registered with DGTD and/or the
Directors/Development Commissioners, Small Scale Industries of the various State Governments.
18. An auction purchaser shall have the option of making full payment of the bid value together with
taxes under rule 12 of the auction rules in the following manner :
(a) at the place of auction within 14 days of the close of the auction either in cash or
by demand draft drawn on State Bank of India, Panna (M.P.) in favour of NMDC
Ltd.,
(b) within a period exceeding 14 days but not exceeding 60 days from the close of the
auction, together with interest on monthly rests on the balance of outstanding at the
rate of 16 per cent per annum, reckoned from the 11th day of the close of the auction
(i.e., interest will be remitted for 10 days),
(c) within a period exceeding 60 days but not exceeding 150 days from the close of
the auction, together with interest monthly rests on the balance outstanding, at the
rate of 17 per cent per annum, reckoned from the 11th day to the 150th day of the
close of the auction, and at the rate of 18 per cent per annum on monthly rests
reckoned from the close of the auction.
(ii) For all other buyers, not falling in category (i) specified above, the following
payment and delivery terms will apply.
An auction purchaser shall have option of making full payment of the bid value together with taxes
under rule 12 of these rules in the following manner :
(a) At the place of auction within 14 days of the close of the auction either in cash or
by demand draft drawn on State Bank of India, Panna (M.P.) in favour of NMDC Ltd.
No interest will be chargeable for this period.
(b) 1. Within a period exceeding 14 days but not exceeding 60 days from the close of
the auction, together with interest on monthly rests thereon at the rate of 16 per cent
per annum, reckoned from the 11th day of the close of the auction (i.e., interest will
be remitted for 10 days) or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 7National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
2. Within a period exceeding 60 days but not exceeding 180 days from the close of
auction, together with interest on monthly rests at the rate of 18 per cent per annum
reckoned from the close of the auction.
(iii) Failure to deposit the sale price in full, together with taxes due thereon under rule 12 of these
rules, shall entail forfeiture of the deposit made under these rules.
(iv) On payment of the above sums in the manner aforesaid, the diamond/packet of diamonds
purchased by the bidder will be delivered to him by a representative of the corporation. The delivery
of the sealed packet to the purchaser will conclude the transaction and no objection as to the
number, quality and character of the diamonds shall be entertained and no liability in this behalf
shall be accepted by the corporation. The corporation will arrange the delivery of diamonds at the
place of the auction for a period of 15 days from the close of auction. Thereafter, the purchaser
should remit by demand draft on the State Bank of India, Panna (M.P.) drawn in favour of the
National Mineral Development Corporation Limited, the balance of the purchase price together with
the taxes legally payable as also interest calculated upto the date of obtaining the bank draft. On
receipt of the demand draft, delivery of the diamonds/packets of diamonds shall be arranged
through a nominated bank at the place of auction. The property in the diamonds shall be deemed to
pass to the purchaser only after he has paid the outstanding dues in full and physical delivery of the
diamond is effected to him and, until such delivery is made the property in the diamonds shall
continue to vest in the corporation.
19. For all categories of buyers, the maximum period within which the delivery of the diamonds has
to be taken by the purchaser, is six months (180 days) reckoned from the close of the auction. No
request for extension of the delivery period beyond this shall ordinarily be entertained.
20. On this rule 11 stress is very much made on behalf of both the sides, particularly to the provision
under rule 11(2)(iv). In this regard it is contended by Mr. Bakthavatsalam, learned Additional
Government Pleader, on behalf of the respondents herein that for the 55th diamond auction at
Madras commencing from 19th January, 1976, rule 11 of the auction rules had been temporarily
replaced by following another procedure and that this temporary replacement of the rule cannot be
taken as an important criteria to determine the sale in the present transaction as inter-State sale or
intra-State sale.
21. In this regard Mr. Natarajan, learned counsel for the revision petitioners, would point out that in
the temporarily replaced provision of rule 11, it is only the original rule 11-A(1) that has been
modified to a certain extent and that there is no specific modification in the auction rules. In the
temporarily replaced rule 11 it is seen that there are provisions relating to the delivery of diamond
within 30 days of the close of the 55th auction.
Deliveries between Purchase by a single purchaser 1 to 15 days 16 to 30 days at the 55th auction.
cash rebate of cash rebate of
----------------------------- -----------------------------
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 8National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
(i) Of a value upto Rs. 50,000 3 per cent 2 per cent
(ii) Of a value between Rs. 50,001 and Rs. 1,00,000 4 per cent 3 per cent
(iii) Of a value of Rs. 1,00,001 and above 5 per cent 4 per cent
22. Note : 1. For purposes of determining the value of purchases by a "single buyer" for calculation
of the cash rebate, purchases bid for in the name entered on a particular admit card will be totalled
and taken as the purchases by that buyer; pooling of purchases on different admit cards will not be
allowed for this purpose. There are also provisions relating to delivery of diamonds from the 31st to
the 60th days of the close of the 55th auction and from the 61st day onwards of the close of the 55th
auction. The rule relating to the delivery of diamonds from the 61st day onwards of the close of the
55th auction shows that no extension of time beyond 90 days of the close of the auction will
ordinarily be allowed, for taking deliveries. In any case, the grant of such extension is solely at the
discretion of the corporation and cannot be insisted upon by an auction purchaser as a matter of
right. In the event of such extension being granted beyond 90 days, no such rebate will be
admissible; also, interest on monthly rests on the balance outstanding will be charged at 18 per cent
per annum, reckoned from the 31st day of the close of the auction till the date of extension of
delivery time is sought, is deposited along with such application seeking extension.
23. It is contended behalf of the revision petitioner that the buyers have expressed their intention to
treat the transaction as inter-State sale by issuing a C form and by furnishing a letter on the same
day. We find from the records that the C forms and letters requesting delivery at Bombay and
indemnifying the sellers against loss or damage in transit, were furnished a few days after the
auction sales. In some cases, however, C forms were furnished on the date of auction sale. The
Tribunal has pointed out a few instances during the course of discussing the facts in the instant case
which run as follows :
----------------------------------------------------------------
In. No. Date of Value Date of Date of auction C form letters sale

12,229.00 31-1-1976 2-2-1976
----------------------------------------------------------------
24. Mr. C. Natarajan, learned counsel for the revision petitioners, also points out that is a forfeiture
clause in the rule governing the auction for sale of off-colour and industrial diamonds. Clause 2, rule
(iii) read as follows :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 9National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
"Failure to deposit the sale price in full, together with taxes due thereon under rule 12
of these rules, shall entail forfeiture of the deposit made under the rules."
25. It is pointed out that as per rule 11 of the auction rules, which stood temporarily replaced by the
procedure in respect of the 55th diamond auction at Madras commencing from 19th January, 1976
also, there is a clause which has a bearing on the question whether a transaction involved in the
auction sale constitutes inter-State sale or intra-State sale. Rule 11, as it stood temporarily replaced
by clause 2 provides as follows :
"No extension of time beyond 90 days of the close of the auction will ordinarily be
allowed for taking deliveries. In any case, that grant of such extension is solely at the
discretion of the corporation and cannot be insisted upon by an auction purchaser as
a matter of right. In the event of such extension being granted beyond 90 days, no
cash rebate will be admissible; also, interest on monthly rests on the balance
outstanding will be charged at 18 per cent per annum, reckoned from the 31st day of
the close of the auction till the date of extension of delivery time is sought, is
deposited along with such application seeking extension."
26. Rule 11 of the auction rules, as it stood temporarily replaced, contains the provision relating to
delivery of diamond and it reads as follows :
"Rule 11-A. (1) Deliveries may be taken at Madras within 30 days of the close of the
auction by payment either in cash or demand draft on the Indian Bank, Esplanade
Branch, Madras 600 001 in favour of National Mineral Development Corporation
Ltd. No interest shall be charged for this period. The auction purchaser will, in
addition, be eligible for a cash rebate on the sales price of the lots of diamonds
purchased by him as set out below, in respect of delivery is taken by him (a) within 15
days of the close of the auction and (b) within 30 days of the close of the auction
respectively."
27. The Tribunal, in its order under revision, has observed in paragraph 8 that rule 11 which was
relied on by the learned counsel was specially modified temporarily in respect of auctions held at
Madras commencing from 19th January, 1976, that the amended rule deals only with cash rebate
admissible for payments and delivery upto 30 days and that the provision which remained in the
original rule in respect of reservation of property by the seller until realisation of full value and
effecting physical delivery, is significantly absent in the amended rule. On the basis of the above
conclusion regarding the auction rule, as amended, the Tribunal held that the revision petitioners
herein could not take advantage of the provision in section 62 of the Sale of Goods Act. In such
circumstances, the normal rule in section 64(2) will come into play and that rule 8 of the auction
rules also provides that if the buyer does not pay the deposit of 25 per cent, the corporation may
cancel the bid without prejudice to any other rights of an unpaid seller. Again rule 13 debars the
buyer from raising any dispute with regard to the number, quality, value and other characteristics
and defects and that all these provisions fortify the view that the sale had concluded on the fall of the
hammer.

28. We have already set out in detail the rules governing the auction sales as per the provisions of
section 64 of the Sale of Goods Act. In this regard, the ratio in Hanutmal Bhutoria v. Dominion of
India is pointed out by Mr. Natarajan, learned counsel for the revision petitioners. In the said
decision, it was laid down thus :
"The explanation to section 148, Contract Act makes it clear that a seller can become
a bailee if he contracts to hold the goods as a bailee. In the absence of such a contract,
he cannot be regarded as a bailee.
The second proviso to section 26, Sale of Goods Act applies to a case where the seller
or the buyer holds the goods in the capacity of bailee either under a contract of
bailment or circumstances which give rise to the relationship of bailor and bailee. The
second proviso means that the operation of the provisions of section 26 is excluded
when the buyer or the seller happens to hold the goods in the character of a bailee.
There is no automatic bailment created by operation of law.
Where the condition of auction sale provided that the lots would be at the risk and
expense of the purchaser from the moment the sale is declared and that cash in full
was to be paid on the fall of the hammer and delivery was to be taken within fifteen
days :
Held that the conditions of sale were inconsistent with the position of there being any
relationship of bailor and bailee between the seller and the purchaser after the sale
was effected. The seller had no liability from the moment of the sale except perhaps
the duty of affording facilities to the purchaser for taking delivery of the goods within
a period of fifteen days from the date of sale."
29. Mr. C. Natarajan points out in this regard paragraph 2 of the letter addressed to the Presiding
Officer, 55th Diamond Auction, NMDC Limited, Madras, with respect to the 55th diamond auction
conducted by the addressee at Madras from 19th January, 1976, which run as follows :
"The above lots have been purchased by us on condition of delivery at Bombay, for
which our sales tax liability will be limited to 4 per cent under the General Sales Tax
Rules and for which we have furnished C form as required."
30. It is pointed out on behalf of the Revenue by Mr. Bakthavatsalam the decision in Dennant v.
Skinner and Collom [1948] 2 KB 164, wherein an auction sale of motor vehicles was held by
Dennant and the vehicle was sold to a man calling George Albert King who was the highest bidder.
There was a misrepresentation by the purchaser as to his identity, the auction seller accepted in
payment a cheque accompanied by the purchaser's certificate which reads as under :
"..... I certify that my cheque No. UUB. 287164 value pound 1190 will be met on
presentation at my bank and furthermore I agree that the ownership of the vehicles
will not pass to me until such time as the proceeds of my cheques have been credited
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 11National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
to South London Motor Auction account at Lloyds Bank Ltd."
"It later turned out that the cheque was dishonoured. In the meantime, the auction
purchaser had sold the vehicle to Mr. Collom who in turn resold it to Mr. Skinner, an
innocent third party. The auction seller brought out a suit for possession of the
vehicle. One of the grounds taken was that the property in the vehicle had not passed
by virtue of the certificate issued by the purchaser. Hallott, J., held that the condition
in the certificate was one obtained after the fall of the hammer, that in an auction sale
property normally passed on the fall of the hammer and there was no special
condition in the auction rules to exclude the application of the prima facie rule
characterising auction sale." At pages 171-172 His Lordship observed :
"I come now to consider the second point on which I understand is this : that the
property in the circumstances of this case did not pass until the price was paid by the
cheque being in order or cash substituted for it. The circumstances in regard to that I
have already stated, and it remains only to consider the law. In the first place, as I
have said, I think that a contract of sale is concluded at an auction sale on that fall of
the hammer. The Sale of Goods Act, 1893 section 18 provides :
'Where there is an unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods, in a
deliverable state, the property in the goods passes to the buyer when the contract is
made, and it is immaterial whether the time of payment or the time of delivery, or
both, be postponed.' Accordingly, upon the fall of the hammer the property of this car
passed to King unless that prima facie rule is excluded from applying because of a
different intention appearing or because there was some condition in the contract
which prevented the rule from applying. However, there was a third aspect of the
matter and that arises out of the document which I have already read. Now, the
document in its terms contemplates that the ownership of the vehicle has not passed
to the bidder, but as I have already said, in my judgment, it had passed upon the fall
of the hammer, and if subsequently the bidder executed the document acknowledging
that ownership of the vehicle would not pass to him, that could not have any effect on
what had already taken place."
31. In the instant case, it is relevant to note that what we are concerned in the transaction is,
whether the sale of goods has to be construed as one having taken place in the course of inter-State
trade or commerce and as such the transaction in question occasioned the movement of goods from
one State to another and not to import much importance to the transaction, the property in the
goods had passed or not since the entire transaction has to be looked at by us only from the point of
view of the concept of intra-State transaction as per the provisions of sections 3 and 4 or the Central
Sales Tax Act which we have extracted above.
32. The decision reported in Consolidated Coffee Ltd. v. Coffee Board is relied on for the
proposition. In the above decision, their Lordships of the Supreme Court have observed thus :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 12National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
"Dealing next with the three stages at which the property in the coffee sold at the
export auctions conducted by the Coffee Board is said to pass to the highest bidder
(registered exporter) three questions arise that need our close examination. Does it
pass at the fall of the hammer when his bid is entered in the register of bids under his
signature under section 64(2) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, as contended for by the
counsel for the States of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala ? Does it pass after the
coffee sold is weighed and set apart for delivery and price is paid therefor by the
auction purchaser in view of clause 19 (particularly the overriding provision
contained therein) and other clauses of the auction conditions (this being the
alternative plea of the petitioners) ? or does it pass only after the coffee sold is
shipped or is sent to the customs station for shipment because till then the Coffee
Board has a right of disposal under clauses 26 and 31 read with section 25 of the Sale
of Goods Act (this being the principal plea of the petitioners) ? It will be desirable to
set out the concerned provisions in order to appreciate properly the rival submissions
of the counsel based thereon. According to the counsel for the three States, section 64
is a special provision in the Sale of Goods Act which deals with auction sales and
under sub-section (2) thereof, the sale is complete no sooner the auctioneer makes an
announcement in that behalf either by fall of the hammer or in other customary
manner and, therefore, the property in the goods sold thereat passes at the fall of the
hammer or immediately after the announcement of completion is made in any other
customary manner and since in the instant case the Coffee Board conducts export
auctions of coffee in lots which are specified in catalogues supplied to the auction
purchasers beforehand, the property in the coffee sold thereat must be regarded as
having passed to the buyer at the fall of the hammer when the successful bid is
entered in the register of bids under the signature of the bidder as per clauses 10 and
11 of the auction conditions. As regards clause 19, a twofold argument was urged : in
the first place it was contended that section 64 is not subject to any contract to the
contrary and, therefore, section 64(2) must prevail under which the property will
pass at the fall of the hammer or at the close of the sale in the customary manner;
secondly, clause 19 containing the overriding provision may bind the parties to the
contract but will not have the effect of creating an estoppel against a third party like a
State Government or its sales tax authorities from contending or showing that the
property at such auctions passes at the fall of the hammer and if under the other
terms of the auction it is clear that the property has passed or does pass to the
auction purchaser at the fall of the hammer a mere declaration of the intention on the
part of the contracting parties deferring or postponing the passing of the property
will not affect the question and in that behalf reliance was placed upon the
observations of Lord Chancellor Herschell in McEntire v. Crossley Bros. Ltd.
[1895-1896] All ER (Reprint) 829 at 832, where the observations run thus :
'Upon an agreement to sell, it depends upon the intention of the parties whether the
property passes or does not pass. Here the parties have in terms expressed their
intention and said that the property shall not pass until the full purchase money is
paid. I know no reason to prevent that being a perfectly lawful agreement. If that was
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 13National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
really the intention of the parties, I know of no rule or principle of law which prevents
it from being given effect to. I quite agree that if, although the parties have inserted a
provision to that effect, they have shown in other parts of the agreement, by the
language which they have used, or the provisions which they have made, that they
intended the property to pass, one must look at the transaction as a whole, and it
might be necessary to hold that the property has passed, although the parties have
said that their intention was that it should not, because they have provided that it
shall. No doubt any provisions which were inconsistent with the intention that the
property should not pass would be given effect to in preference to a mere expression
of intention in words.'"
33. In the instant case before us, it is relevant to note that the formalities of an auction did take
place at Madras. Whether the sale had been completed here at Madras or at Bombay in the light of
the provisions of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act, 1959 and the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956,
we do find that the contention raised on behalf of the revision petitioners herein cannot be held to
be wholly unsustainable.
34. The decision in State of Gujarat v. Bombay Metal Alloys and Manufacturing Co. P. Ltd. [1983] 54
STC 45 (Guj) is relied on for the proposition that the mere fact that the contract of sale itself does
not provide for or occasion a movement of goods would not be an impediment in the way of holding
that section 3(a) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, applies provided it is established that the
movement of goods from one State to another is in pursuance of or incidental to the contract of sale.
If there is a conceivable link between the contract of sale and the movement of goods from one State
to another which is not otherwise explained, the transaction in question will have to be regarded as a
"sale" or "purchase" as the case may be, in the course of inter-State trade. In the said decision, it was
held further that the contract of sale itself was not shown to have provided for the movement of
goods and the movement of goods was not shown to have been occasioned in accordance with the
specific terms of the contract. But the facts of the case cumulatively indicated that there was a
conceivable link between the contract of sale and the movement of goods and the nexus was not
otherwise explained, and the movement of goods was occasioned as a result of, or in pursuance of,
the contract of sale. For the purpose of section 3(a) of the Central Act, it was immaterial where the
property in the goods passed. Therefore, the purchase of goods by the assessee in public auction at
Gujarat was in the course of inter-State trade and it was not exigible to purchase Tax under section
15 of the Gujarat Act.
35. In this regard, Chapter II of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 is again pointed out by the learned
counsel for the revision petitioners. Section 3 reads as follows :
"3. When is a sale or purchase of goods said to take place in the course of inter-State
trade or commerce. - A sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed to take place in the
course of inter-State trade or commerce if the sale or purchase -
(a) occasions the movement of goods from one State to another; or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 14National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
(b) is effected by a transfer of documents of title to the goods during their movement
from one State to another."
36. Section 4(2) reads as follows :
"A sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed to take place inside a State, if the goods
are within the State."
37. Sections 4(2) enables us to fix the situs of the transaction and it is needless to state that the
provision of section 4 is subject to the provisions of section 3. A careful reading of both the sections
together clearly makes us to come to the above conclusion. The Tribunal in the instant case before
us has held that the falling of the hammer is significant to indicate that the property in the
ascertained goods, namely, the diamond in the instant case, has passed to the purchaser and,
therefore, the transaction is intra-State transaction and was subject to the liability of payment of
sales tax under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act, 1959. When the transaction,
as a whole, is scrutinised by us we are inclined to differ from the view that was taken by the
Tribunal.
38. In this regard, we would once again like to reiterate the principle which has guided us to come to
the conclusion differing from the view taken by the Tribunal. The decision in Oil India Ltd. v.
Superintendent of Taxes lays down that the movement of crude oil from the State of Assam to the
State of Bihar was an incident of the contract of sale and, therefore, the sales to the refinery at
Barauni were sales in the course of inter-State trade. The Bihar Government had no jurisdiction to
tax the sales under the sales tax law of that State and the petitioner was entitled to the refund of tax
collected from it by the Bihar Government. In the above case, the Supreme Court has held that no
matter in which State the property in the goods passes, a sale which occasions 'movement of goods
from one State to another is a sale in the course of inter-State trade". The inter-State movement
must be the result of a convenant, express or implied, in the contract of sale or an incident of the
contract. It is not necessary that the sale must precede the inter-State movement in order that the
sale may be deemed to have occasioned such movement. It is also not necessary for a sale to be
deemed to have taken place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce, that the convenant
regarding inter-State movement must be specified in the contract itself. It would be enough if the
movement was in pursuance of and incidental to the contract of sale. We are following the ratio
decidendi in the decision reported in Oil India Ltd. v. Superintendent of Taxes faithfully to the facts
of the instant case before us. The auction in this case did start on 19th January, 1976, and this fact is
not in dispute.
39. In Tata Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. v. S. R. Sarkar , the Supreme Court has held that under the
explanation to section 2(a), in cases of sales falling within section 3(a), the place of business is the
place from which movement has commenced and in cases of sales falling within section 3(b), it is
the place where the sale is effected. But there is in the explanation, no material for ascertaining the
place where the sale is effected. Clause (2) of the explanation does not seek to locate the place where
the sale is effected, in cases falling within clause (b) of section 3, at the place where the transfer of
documents of title to the to the goods was effected. In this regard also, we have to bear in mind rule
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 15National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
11 replacement of the same for the transaction in question subsequently. In doing so, we do find that
there is substance in what had been submitted on behalf off the revision petitioners herein. In the
above decision, at page 666, their Lordships of the Supreme Court have observed :
"A sale being by the definition, transfer of property, becomes taxable under section
3(a) if the movement of goods from one State to another is under a convenant or
incident of the contract of sale, and the property in the goods passes to the purchaser
otherwise than by transfer of documents of title when the goods are in movement
from one State to another. In respect of an inter-State sale, the tax is leviable only
once and that indicates that the two clauses of section 3 are mutually exclusive. A sale
taxable as falling within clause (a) of section 3, will be excluded from the purview of
clause (b) of section 3; otherwise certain sales may be liable to tax under both the
clauses and two States may, in respect of a single sale, claim to levy the tax contrary
to the plain intendment of sections 6 and 9 of the Act ........ Cases of this Court, viz.,
State of Travancore-Cochin v. Bombay Co. Ltd. [1952] SCR 1112; [1952] 3 STC 434
and STC 434 and State of Travancore-Cochin v. Shanmugha Vilas Cashew-nut
Factory [1954] SCR 53; [1953] 4 STC 205 relied upon by counsel for the State of West
Bengal have no bearing on the interpretation of section 3, clauses (a) and (b). In
those cases, the meaning of the expressions, 'in the course of import and export' and
'in the course of inter-State trade or commerce' used in article 286 fell to be
determined. The Constitution does not define these expressions. The Parliament has
in the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, sought to define by section 3 when a sale or
purchase of goods is said to take place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce
and by section 4(1) to define when a sale or purchase of goods is said to take place
outside a State and by section 5, when a sale or purchase is said to take place in the
course of import or export. In interpreting these definition clauses, it would be
inappropriate to requisition in aid the observations made in ascertaining the true
nature and incidents without the assistance of any definition clause of 'sales outside
the State' and 'sales in the course of import or export' and 'sales in the course of
inter-State trade or commerce' used in article 286.
In our view, therefore, within clause (b) of section 3 are included sales in which
property in the goods passes during the movement of the goods from one State to
another by transfer of documents of title thereto : clause (a) of section 3 covers sales,
other than those included in clause (b), in which the movement of goods from one
State to another is the result of a convenant or incident of the contract of sale, and
property in the goods passes in either State."
40. Arguments were advanced by either side with respect to the submission of C forms in the instant
case before us. With respect to this aspect, the decision in State of Madras v. Bramhappa
Tavanappanavar (Mysore) Private Ltd., Madras-21 [1974] 33 STC 601 (Mad.) is referred to wherein
it was observed :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 16National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
"The assessee claimed that certain sales were inter-State but it did not produce the
relevant contracts of sale to prove that the transactions were inter-State sales. The
invoice and other correspondence produced by the assessee indicated that the goods
had been transported by ship from Madras to Calcutta, and the assessee had collected
the sale price by sending the bill of lading and other documents through banks for
collection. The assessee had also got the C forms from the out-of-State buyers. The
Tribunal held that the movement of the goods to the out-of-State destination could
only be as an incident of the contract of sale and, therefore, the sales were inter-State
in character. On a revision : Held, that the Tribunal had come to the right conclusion
on the facts."
41. In the said decision it was held that the assessees have also got C forms from out-of-State buyers.
The out-of-State buyers would never have issued C forms to the assessees unless there was actual
contract to purchase the goods from the assessees. In the instant case before us, the Tribunal has
factually recorded its finding regarding the source of the transaction involved in paragraph 7 of the
order under revision thus :
"We have carefully considered the argument as also the records. The undisputed facts
involved in the case are the National Mineral Development Corporation Limited, a
Government of India undertaking, has a diamond mining project with two diamond
mines in Panna, Madhya Pradesh. The diamonds won from these mines are
periodically sold in rough (uncut) form in auctions in various centres in the country.
The date and venue of the auctions are notified to the public through advertisements
in the leading newspapers. The notices are also sent to the Diamond Merchants'
Associations in various cities for circulation to its members. On the day of the
commencement of the auction, the merchants desirous of participating in the
auction, register themselves at the auction centre and obtain cards on payment of a
refundable sum of Rs. 2,000 each. The diamond lots put up for auction are displayed
at the auction centre for inspection by the registered merchants. Before the
commencement of inspection, the participating persons are issued the rules
governing the auction and the catalogues listing the items put up for inspection and
sale. Upon completion of inspection of the lots put on display, the said lots are taken
up for auction. The registered merchants present are invited to offer bids. After a bid
is accepted by the Presiding Officer and is knocked down, the successful purchaser is
required to sign the bid register in token of his agreement to purchase the concerned
item and to pay security deposit of 25 per cent of the sale value of the concerned item
for which a receipt is issued to him. The lot for which the sum representing 25 per
cent of the value of the bid has been paid by the successful bidder, is sealed in an
envelope and signed by the Presiding Officer in the presence of the bidder. The
bidder also puts his own seal on the packet, if he desires to do so. The invoice is
prepared forthwith indicating the item number, the weight of the item, the price
accepted and the total value and also the security deposit amount paid by the
successful bidder. From the 55th auction held in January, 1976 onwards, the delivery
of the diamond lots sold is made either at Madras or at Bombay on the basis of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 17National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
stipulation made by the bidder concerned as to whether the bid and purchase are
subject to delivery at Bombay on payment of Central sales tax, instead of at Madras.
Delivery at Bombay is arranged only in cases where the purchaser confirms in writing
that the purchases made by him are subject to delivery at Bombay. Deliveries at
Madras during the course of the auction are made by the corporation's representative
on collection from the purchaser of the outstanding amounts due, i.e., the sale value
plus NMDC service charges plus interest on the outstanding balance, if any due, plus
Tamil Nadu general sales tax and surcharge at the applicable rates minus security
deposit which would have been paid on the item being knocked down in his favour.
For deliveries after the close of the auction, the diamond lots, in sealed covers, are
entrusted to the corporation's bankers who deliver them to the concerned merchants
on collection of the outstanding amounts due, within the prescribed delivery period.
For deliveries at Bombay, the diamond lots are sent by the corporation by insured
post parcels or as precious cargo by air, to its Bombay office for being placed in the
bank lockers there. The lots, in sealed covers are made over to the purchasers, within
the prescribed delivery period, on the purchasers (a) depositing the outstanding
amounts due, i.e., sale value plus NMDC service charges plus interest on the
outstanding balance, if any due, plus Central sales tax at the applicable rate, minus
security deposit already paid and (b) submitting form. On delivery of the diamond
lots in sealed covers to the purchasers, the original copy of the invoice with all the
entries made therein regarding sales tax, etc., and final receipt for the total amounts
paid for the item (a) in question are handed over to the purchaser along with the
goods. On these facts, the question now for consideration is, whether the sale in each
case is complete in Madras attracting levy of Tamil Nadu general sales tax or whether
it is an inter-State sale liable to Central sales tax."
42. It is relevant in this contention to note that in the assessment order dated 4th December, 1976
by the Joint Commercial Tax Officer, Rattan Bazaar Circle, Madras-1, he has observed thus in
paragraph 3.
"It is seen therefrom that after the purchases, the buyer has given detailed
instructions about the despatch of goods to Bombay by V.P.P. The buyer (as per para
4 of the letter) has indemnified the National Mineral Development Corporation
against any loss or damage in transit, and the buyer has been separately charged 0.75
per cent of the purchase value towards the services done by the National Mineral
Development Corporation in despatching the diamonds in convenient packets so that
the value does not exceed Rs. 10,000 in each packet."
43. For the sake of completion, we have referred to the above observation of the assessing authority
since it has got bearing on the arguments advanced by either side in the transactions involved.
44. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner (CT) II, Madras City in his order dated 20th June, 1977,
has observed :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 18National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
"More than that to rule 11(iii) the corporation will arrange the delivery of the
diamonds at the place of the auction for a period of 15 days from the close of the
auction. This is specific and clear that the purchase by the successful bidder was
concluded and completed on the date of auction itself. Any other service rendered by
the corporation in the arrangements of delivery of the diamonds and for recovery of
the balance of the value is only an activity not connected with the sale."
45. The rules governing the auction for sale of off-colour and industrial diamonds contemplated
under rule 10 is that the bidder shall also put his own seal on the packet and the packet so sealed will
be numbered and the number will be mentioned in the money receipt to be granted to the successful
bidder for the particular purchase. In this regard, Mr. Bakthavatsalam, learned Additional
Government Pleader, points out rule 11(2)(iv) :
"On payment of the above sums in the manner aforesaid, the diamond/packet of
diamonds purchased by the bidder will be delivered to him by a representative of the
corporation. The delivery of the sealed packet to the purchaser will conclude the
transaction and no objection as to the number, quality and character of the diamonds
shall be entertained and no liability in this behalf will be accepted by the corporation.
The corporation will arrange the delivery of diamonds at the place of the auction for a
period of 15 days from the close of auction. Thereafter, the purchaser should remit by
demand draft on the State Bank of India, Panna (M.P.) drawn in favour of the
National Mineral Development Corporation Limited, the balance of the purchase
price together with the taxes legally payable as also interest calculated upto the date
of obtaining the bank draft. On receipt of the demand draft, delivery of the
diamond(s)/packet(s) of diamonds shall be arranged through a nominated bank at
the place of auction. The property in the diamonds shall be deemed to pass to the
purchaser only after he has paid the outstanding dues in full any physical delivery of
the diamond is effected to him, and until such delivery is made the property in the
diamonds shall continue to vest in the corporation. For all categories of buyers, the
maximum period within which the delivery of the diamonds has to be taken by the
purchaser, is six month (180 days) reckoned from the close of the auction. No request
for extension of the delivery period beyond this shall ordinarily be entertained."
46. It is also brought to our notice that this rule 11 was submitted for the 55th diamond auction held
at Madras which commenced from January, 1976. In the instant case before us, we find that the
petitioners-National Mineral Development Corporation Limited, are Government of India
undertaking owning a diamond mining project with two diamond mines in Panna (M.P.). The
diamonds cut from these mines are periodically sold in rough (uncut) form in auctions in various
centres in the country. The date and venue of the auctions are notified to the public through
advertisements in leading newspapers. On the day of commencement of the auction, merchants
desirous of participating in the auction, register themselves at the auction centre and obtain admit
cards on payment of a refundable sum of Rs. 2,000 each. The diamond lots put up for auction are
displayed at the auction centre for inspection by the registered merchants. Before the
commencement of inspection, the participating persons are issued the rules governing the auction
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 19National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
and the catalogues listing the items put up for inspection and sale. Upon completion of inspection of
the lots put on display, the said lots are taken up for auction. The registered merchants and is
knocked down, the successful purchaser is required to sign the bid register in token of his agreement
to purchase the concerned item and to pay security deposit of 25 per cent of the sale value of the
concerned item for which a receipt is issued to him. The lot for which the sum representing 25 per
cent of the value of the bid has been paid by the successful bidder, is sealed in an envelope and
signed by the Presiding by the successful bidder, is sealed in an envelope and signed by the
Presiding Officer in the presence of the bidder.
47. In A. V. Thomas & Co. Ltd. v. Deputy Commissioner of Agricultural Income-tax and Sales Tax,
Trivandrum where it was held that the scope of the explanation to article 286(1)(a) of the
Constitution of India was considered. When the provision of the said article is inapplicable, it is the
"passing of the property within the State" that is intended to be fastened on for the purpose of
determining whether a sale is "inside" or "outside" the State. Therefore subject to the operation of
the "explanation", the State in which the property in the goods passes would be the only State which
would have the power to levy a tax on the sale. Under the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, in an auction sale
of specific goods the title in the goods passes and the sale is complete as soon as the hammer falls.
Teas were stored in the godowns at Willingdon Island in the Travancore-Cochin State and samples
of the teas were taken in Fort Cochin in the State of Madras. There, by the samples, the teas were
sold by public auction in lots. Some were purchased in their entirety and others in parts. After
consideration money was paid at Fort Cochin, delivery orders were given to the buyers addressed to
the godown keepers at Willingdon Island and actual delivery was taken there. The teas were then
sent out from Willingdon Island for consumption either in other parts of India or were exported out
of India. On the question whether the sales of teas "in full lots" were liable to sales tax under the
Travancore-Cochin General Sales Tax Act, 1125, it was held by the Supreme Court :
"(1) that the property in the goods passed at Fort Cochin but the fiction created by the
explanation to article 286(1)(a) was inapplicable because there was no delivery as a
direct result of sale for the purpose of consumption in any particular State;
(2) that therefore both the categories of sales (teas taken to other parts of India and
those exported out of India) were not inside the State of Travancore-Cochin but were
outside that State and were not liable to be taxed under the Travancore-Cochin
General Sales Tax Act, 1125."
48. Mr. Bakthavatsalam, the learned Additional Government Pleader, has taken us through the
observation of their Lordships of the Supreme Court at pages 367 to 369 which runs as follows :
"In the present case as soon as the hammer fell the title in the goods passed to the
buyer as the goods were specific goods, i.e., goods which were auctioned in full lots
and this event took place at Fort Cochin which was in the State of Madras. But in the
case of unascertained goods the title in the goods does not pass to the buyer unless
and until the goods are ascertained. It was for this reason that a distinction was
drawn by the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal between goods which were sold in full lots
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 20National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
and those which were sold in portions. In regard to the former it was held that the
title passed as soon as the hammer fell but not so in regard to the latter and therefore
the sale of 'full lots' was held to have taken place outside the State of
Travancore-Cochin and of portions of lots inside that State. The case was
consequently remanded to the Sales Tax Officer for determining the amount of the
tax.
The High Court in revision held that the words in article 286(1)(a) 'outside the State'
do not mean transfer of ownership according to the Sale of Goods Act, but it was lex
situs which determines the taxability of the transaction and the correct position is
that the ownership in the goods is transferred according to the law of the place where
the goods are situate. Therefore the sale in the present case was in the State of
Travancore-Cochin and there is nothing in the explanation to article 286(1)(a) which
provides to the contrary.
It has been found and it has not disputed that the title to the goods in the present
case passed at Fort Cochin. The purchase money was paid there and the purchaser
obtained from the auctioneer delivery notes directing the godown keepers at
Willingdon Island to deliver the goods and only the actual physical delivery of the
goods took place at Willingdon Island. In the circumstances the question is whether
the sale was 'outside sale' or 'inside sale' as the expressions have been compendiously
used in various judgments to indicate sales taking place within a State or without it.
The explanation to indicate sales taking place within a State or without it. The
explanation to article 286(1)(a) which has been set out above explains what a sale
outside the State is. According to that explanation a fiction is created as between two
States, one where the goods are delivered for consumption in that State and the other
where the title in the goods passed and the former is treated as the situs of the taxable
event to the exclusion of the latter. Therefore where the explanation applies the
difficulty about the situs is resolved but in a case like the present one the difficulty
still remains because the explanation does not operate in the sense that the rival
States claiming to tax the same taxable event are not the States of delivery for
consumption in that State and those where the title in the goods passes. In somewhat
similar circumstances this court in India Copper Corporation Ltd. v. State of Bihar ,
held by a majority decision that the opening words of article 286(1) which speak of a
sale or purchase taking place and the non obstante clause in the explanation, which
refers to the general law relating to the sale of goods, indicated that it was the
'passing of property within the State' that was intended to be fastened on for the
purpose of determining, whether the sale in question was 'inside' or 'outside' the
State and therefore subject to the operation of the 'explanation', that State in which
property passed would be the only State which would have the power to levy a tax on
the sale. At page 286 it was observed :
'The conclusion reached therefore is that where the property in the goods passed
within a State as a direct result of the sale, the sale transaction is not outside the State
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 21National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
for the purpose of article 286(1)(a), unless the explanation operates.' The majority
decision in India Copper Corporation Ltd. v. State of Bihar , concludes the points in
favour of the appellants. On the facts of this case it was found by the Sales Tax
Appellate Tribunal that in regard to the sales of tea in 'full lots' the property passed at
Fort Cochin and this view has not been challenged in this court. Therefore, on the
majority decision in India Copper Corporation Ltd. v. State of Bihar , the only State
which would have the power to levy a tax on such sale would be the State of Madras
and so far as Travancore-Cochin was concerned, the sale would be an outside sale.
In the present case, therefore, the sale was an 'outside sale' and cannot be said to be
an 'inside sale' qua Travancore-Cochin because the title passed at Fort Cochin which
is in the State of Madras. Apart from that, money was paid there and the delivery
order was also received there even through the actual physical delivery of goods was
made at Willingdon Island in the State of Travancore-Cochin. The fiction created by
the explanation to article 286(1)(a) is inapplicable because there was no delivery as a
direct result of sale for the purpose of consumption in any particular State.
There then remains the question of goods were exported out of India from
Willingdon Island. In the case of those goods also it cannot be said that there was a
sale inside the State of Travancore-Cochin because the same considerations will apply
to those sales as to the sales already discussed i.e., goods the title to which passed at
Fort Cochin were delivered at Willingdon Island and were delivered for consumption
in parts of India other than Travancore-Cochin.
In our view therefore the High Court was in error and the appeal should therefore be
allowed and the judgment and order of the High Court of Kerala set aside. The
appellant will have its costs in this court and in the High Court."
49. We have been taken through the observations of their Lordships of the Supreme Court in
Consolidated Coffee Ltd. v. Coffee Board [1980] 46 STC 164 at page 165, which we have already
incorporated in this judgment. In the instant case before us it is not dispute that the goods in
question viz., the diamonds are ascertained goods and that the seal is also ascertained goods. Can
the affixing of the seal by the person purchasing rely on the same to absolve them from paying the
sales tax under the provisions of the Central Sales Tax Act is the question that we have to consider
carefully in the instant case before us, Section 20 of the Sale of Goods Act reads as follows :
"Specific goods in a deliverable state. - Where there is an unconditional contract for
the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state, the property in the goods passes to the
buyer when the contract is made, and it is immaterial whether the time of payment of
the price or the time of delivery of the goods, or both is postponed."
50. In the instant case before us, though the auction took place in the State of Tamil Nadu, yet the
delivery, viz., the diamonds in the instant case have to be given only at Bombay as per the agreement
since it is only 25 per cent of the consideration that is actually paid soon after the fall of the hammer
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 22National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
in the transaction of auction. A payment that has to be made at Bombay by the purchaser has
nothing to do with the sale which was completed at Madras by the fall of hammer in favour of the
revision petitioners. In this regard the decision in Dennant v. Skinner and Collom [1948] 2 All ER
29 is referred to. At page 190 of Consolidated Coffee Ltd. v. Coffee Board their Lordships of the
Supreme Court referred to this decision reported in Dennant v. Skinner and Collom [1948] 2 All ER
29. The decision in A. V. Thomas & Co. Ltd. v. Deputy Commissioner of Agricultural Income-tax and
Sales Tax, Trivandrum is also referred to by their Lordships in the decision in Consolidated Coffee
Ltd. v. Coffee Board . The scope of section 20 of the Sale of Goods Act has been comprehensively
enlightened by their Lordships of the Supreme Court. We have already referred to the decision in
State of Gujarat v. Bombay Metal Alloys & Manufacturing Co. Private Ltd. [1983] 54 STC 45 (Guj)
for the proposition that the purpose of goods by the assessee in the said case in public auction at
Gujarat was in the course of inter-State trade and it was not exigible to purchase tax under section
15 of the Gujarat Act.
Mr. Bakthavatsalam, learned Additional Government Pleader, in his arguments further pointed out
that in Balabhagas Hulaschand v. State of Orissa [1976] 37 STC 207 at page 212 their Lordships of
the Supreme Court have observed as follows :
"It would thus be seen that word 'sale' has been given a very wide connotation by the
Parliament so as to include within its fold not only sales of goods which are usually
known in common parlance but also transactions, which legally cannot be called
sales, for instance, a transfer of goods on the hire-purchase system. It seems to us
that the Parliament wanted to give the widest amplitude to the word 'sale' and, that is
why, while in section 3 the words 'sale of goods' have been used, in section 4(2),
clauses (a) and (b), which deal with the situs of the sale, the words 'contract of sale'
have been used in the same sense. In other words, the word 'sale' defined in clause (g)
of section 2 and used in section 3 and other sections is wide enough to include not
only a concluded contract of sale but also a contract or agreement of sale provided the
agreement of sale stipulates that there was a transfer of property or movement of
goods.
51. In Sales Tax Officer, Pilibhit v. Budh Prakash Jai Prakash quoting Benjamin on Sale (8th
Edition), Venkatarama Ayyar, J., who spoke for the court, observed as follows :
'The distinction between a sale and an agreement to sell under section 1 of the
English Act is thus by Benjamin on Sale, Eighth Edition, 1950 :
"In order to constitute a sale there must be -
(1) An agreement to sell, by which alone the property does not pass; and (2) an actual
sale, by which the property passes.
It will be observed that the definition of a contract of sale above-cited includes a mere agreement to
sell as well as the actual sale."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 23National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
This distinction between sales and agreements to sell based upon the passing of the property in the
goods is of great importance in determining the rights of parties under a contract.'
52. It would thus appear that this court clearly held that an agreement to sell by which the property
did not actually pass was also an element of sale. Of course in that case the court had to decide a
different point, namely, whether it was within the competence of a State Legislature to tax not a sale
but even an agreement to sell, where an actual sale had not taken place. This court held that the
State Legislature was not competent to make such a levy under any statute passed by it.
Section 3 of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956, runs thus :
'3. A sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed to take place in the course of
inter-State trade or commerce if the sale or purchase, -
(a) occasions the movement of goods from one State to another; or
(b) is effected by a transfer of documents of title to the goods during their movement
from one State to another.' Section 3 consists of two clauses. But in the instant case
we are not concerned with clause (b) but only with clause (a). Analysing clause (a) of
section 3 of the Central Sales Tax Act it would appear that before section 3 can apply,
the following facts must be established :
(i) that there is a sale or purchase of goods; and
(ii) that the sale occasions the movement of goods from one State to another.
If these two conditions are satisfied the sale becomes an inter-State sale on which tax could be levied
under the Central Sales Tax Act.
The serious question that arises for consideration in this case is whether or not the term 'sale of
goods' as used in section 3 includes an agreement to sell. It has already been pointed out that an
agreement to sell is undoubtedly an element of sale. In fact a sale consists of three logical steps - (i)
that there is an offer; (ii) that there is an agreement to sell when the offer is accepted; and (iii) that
in pursuance of the said agreement a concluded sale takes place. When the statute uses the words
'sales or purchase of goods', it automatically attracts the definition of sale of goods as given in
section 4 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, which is a statute passed by the same Parliament and is to
some extent in pari materia to the Central Sales Tax Act so far as transaction of sale is concerned.
Sections 4 of the Sale of Goods Act runs thus :
'4.
(1) A contract of sale of goods is a contract whereby the seller transfers or agrees to
transfer the property in goods to the buyer for a price. There may be a contract of sale
between one part-owner and another.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 24National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
(2) A contract of sale may be absolute or conditional.
(3) Where under a contract of sale the property in the goods is transferred from the
seller to the buyer, the contract is called a sale, but where the transfer of the property
in the goods is to take place at a future time or subject to some condition thereafter to
be fulfilled, the contract is called an agreement to sell.
(4) An agreement to sell becomes a sale when the time elapses or the conditions are
fulfilled subject to which the property in the goods is to be transferred.'
53. Section 4(1), therefore, clearly provides that a contract of sale of goods includes also an
agreement to transfer property in goods to the buyer for a price. The inevitable conclusion that
follows from the combined effect of the interpretation of section 3 of the Central Sales Tax Act and
section 4 of the Sale of Goods Act is that an argument to sell is also an essential ingredient of sale
provided it contains a stipulation for transfer of goods from the seller to the buyer. This being the
position if there is a movement of goods from one State to another, not in pursuance of the sale
itself, but in pursuance of an agreement to sell, which later merges into a sale, the movement of
goods would be deemed to have been occasioned by the sale itself wherever it takes place. In this
view of the matter, the question as to whether agreement to sell was a forwarded contract or a
contract in respect of unascertainable or future goods would make no difference for the simple
reason that when once a sale takes place, or for that matter when the goods start moving from one
State to another in pursuance of the agreement to sell they cease to be future goods because they are
in existence and they become also ascertainable. The argument of the learned counsel for the
appellant is based on a clear fallacy because it seeks to draw an artificial distinction between a
contract of sale of ascertainable goods and a contract of sale of unascertainable or future goods. This
argument fails to take note of the fact that when the movement of the goods start they shed the
character of either unascertained goods or future goods. Hence for the purpose of application of
section 3(a) of the Central Sales Tax Act, the question whether the contract is a forward contract or
not makes no material difference."
54. Mr. C. Natarajan, learned counsel for the revision petitioners, in the course of his reply has
reiterated what he had submitted already and has further pointed out the provisions of section 20,
section 62 and section 64 of the Sale of Goods Act with a special reference to clause 11 in the instant
contract of sale between the parties and submitted that the revision petitioners herein can insist on
payment and file a suit as an unpaid vendor in case of non-payment of consideration but the
condition favourable to the purchaser is that the revision petitioners herein have to wait for
performance for about ninety days and that on failure to deposit the earnest as per the condition No.
7 entails forfeiture of the amount paid as security deposit. It is further pointed out by Mr. C.
Natarajan, learned counsel for the revision petitioners herein, that the "security deposit" gives an
incite to the terms of the contract incorporated in the rules governing the auction for sale of
off-coloured and industrial diamonds. Rules 7, 8 and 9 of the said rules which were framed by the
National Mineral Development Corporation Limited, a Government of India undertaking, who are
the revision petitioners herein, payment against delivery is agreed upon between the parties. In this
regard the following passage which occurs at pages 148 and 149 of Benjamin on Sale (1974 edition)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 25National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
is extracted :
"Postponement of delivery or payment : Under English law, as distinct from the civil
law, the property in a specific chattel may pass under a contract of sale without
delivery (Badische Anilin Und Fabrik v. Hickson [1906] AC 419, 424). This principle
seems to have been formulated in the common law as early as the fifteenth century
[See Fifoot, History and Sources of the Common Law : Tort and Contract (1949), p.
228. Contrast Cochrane v. More (1890) 25 QBD 57, 71 (comparatively modern)].
Further, by 1893 it was well established that the passing of property was not
conditional on payment or tender of the price [Tarling v. Baxter (1827) 6 B & C 360.
Cf. Noy's Maxims, 87-89]. Under section 28 of the Act, unless otherwise agreed,
delivery of the goods and payment of the price are concurrent conditions; and under
section 39(1) a seller has in certain circumstances a right to withhold delivery and to
retain possession of the goods until payment by virtue of an unpaid seller's lien. But
passing of the property and the right to possession are two different things (Dennant
v. Skinner and Collom [1948] 2 KB 164, 172). Thus if postponement of the purchase
price and the delivery of the goods can properly be described as a postponement of
the completion of the purchase, the property will pass on the entering into the
contract, although in that sense the completion of the purchase is deferred [Re
Anchor Line (Henderson Bros.) Ltd. [1937] 1 Ch 1, 9]. It is important, however, to
bear in mind that the governing principle is that contained in section 17, and it has
been said that 'in modern times very little is needed to give rise to the inference that
the property in specific goods is to pass only on delivery or payment [Ward (R.V.)
Ltd. v. Bignall [1967] 1 QB 534, 545]. See also Minister for Supply and Development
v. Servicemen's Co-op. Joinery Manufacturers' Ltd. (1951) 82 CLR 621, 635, 640'.
Unconditional contract. Considerable difficulty attaches to the meaning of the words
'unconditional contract' contained in rule 1 of section 18 [See Gower, 13 MLR 362,
364 (1950); Smith, 14 MLR 173 (1951); Stoljar, 16 MLR 174 (1953); Atiyah, The Sale
of Goods, 4th ed. p. 144]. Most of the difficulty has arisen out of the fact that, before
1967, a literal application of section 11(1)(c) of the Act (now amended by section 4(1)
of the Misrepresentation Act, 1967) would take away the buyer's right to reject for
breach of condition once the property in the goods had passed. The more natural
interpretation is that 'unconditional' mean not subject to any condition suspensive of
the passing of the property [Sale of Goods Act, 1893, section 1(2)]. It is submitted
that this interpretation is the correct one. An alternative interpretation, however, is
that the words connote a contract which contains no condition unfulfilled by the
seller, in the sense of an essential stipulation the breach of which may give rise to a
right to treat the contract as repudiated [See Taylor v. Combined Buyers Ltd. (1924)
NZLR 627. Ammachdoun Motors Ltd. v. Gray Motors Ltd. (1963) NZLR 5, 8]. In
Varley v. Whipp [1900] 1 QB 513. See also Olett v. Jordan [1918] 2 KB 41, 45 (on
section 18, rule 5) an auction was brought by the seller for the price of a particular
reaping machine which he had described to the buyer as 'new the previous year, and
only used to cut fifty or sixty acres'. The machine was old, and there was thus a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 26National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
breach of the condition implied by section 13 of the 1893 Act. The buyer rejected the
machine when delivered to him and it was held that he was not liable for the price.
Channell, J., said that section 18, rule 1, of the Act did not apply since 'this was not an
unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods', although there was no
suspensive condition in the contract of sale. This case might appear to support the
alternative interpretation given above and to establish that, where an essential
stipulation is broken by the seller, the property in specific goods passes to the buyer
only if and when he accepts the goods (See Leaf v. International Galleries [1950] 2 KB
86, 89-90).
It is to be noted, however, that Varley v. Whipp [1900] 1 QB 513, 517 concerned a sale
of goods by description. Channell, J., appears to have regarded the description as an
identification of the goods contracted to be sold, for the says ([1900] 1 QB 513, 517) :
'If a man says he will sell the black horse in the last stall in his stable, and the stall is
empty, or there is no horse in it, but only a cow, no property could pass. But if he says
he will sell a four-year old horse in the last stall, and there is a horse in the stall, but it
is not a four-year old, the property would only be a collateral warranty.' It is therefore
not unreasonable to suppose that he intended to lay down a different proposition,
viz., that where goods are sold by description, and the description identifies the goods
[Cf. Parsons v. Sexton (1847) 4 CB 899], no property will pass in any goods other
than those which correspond with the description (See Vigers Brothers v. Sanderson
Brothers [1901] 1 QB 608). The difficulty lies in reconciling the concepts of 'specific
goods' and a 'sale of goods by description' [See Stoljar, 16 MLR 174 (1953)]. If such is
the case, the inapplicability of section 18, rule 1, did not result merely from the fact
that the contract contained a condition unfulfilled by the seller. It was inapplicable
because the goods which the seller delivered in pretended fulfilment of the contract
were not those identified by the terms of the contract of sale."
55. In this regard condition (7) of the rules is pointed out by Mr. C. Natarajan, learned counsel for
the revision petitioners, which runs as follows :
"(7) On the fall of the hammer the highest bidder shall be deemed to be the purchaser
and he shall pay in cash or through a demand draft on State Bank of India, Panna
(M.P.), a deposit (for which a receipt will be granted to him) equivalent to 25 per cent
of the purchase value. It will, however, be open to the bidder to deposit the full
amount of the bid in the manner aforesaid along with the additional sums due under
rule 12 of these rules and to take delivery of the diamond/packet of diamonds,
immediately on being declared the purchaser, as aforesaid. On the fall of the
hammer, no irregularity in holding the auction shall entitle the highest bidder to
rescind his bid or purchase of diamond or the packet of diamonds and no objection of
any nature whatsoever shall invalidate the acceptance of the highest bid."
56. It is not out of the way, if we mention the position of law regarding the inter-State sale as
available in American law. It was a controversial question whether the grant of power to Congress
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 27National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
under the commerce clause was exclusive or whether the States had a concurrent power over
commerce. Federal regulation of inter-State commerce was very meagre in the beginning and the
critical issue was the scope of State power as against the commerce clause. Marshall, C.J., in
Gibbons v. Ogden (1824) 9 Wheaton 1; 6 L ED 23 was inclined to the view that the federal commerce
power was exclusive. Under the lead of Chief Justice Taney, who succeeded Marshall, C.J., in 1836,
the Supreme Court recognised that the States possessed a limited concurrent authority over
inter-State commerce.
57. A State cannot levy a direct tax burden inter-State commerce [Vide State Freight Tax case (1873)
15 Wallace 232, McCarroll v. Dixie Greyhound Lines (1940) 309 US 176 and Ingels v. Morf (1937)
300 US 90]. In Western Live Stock Co. v. Bureau of Revenue (1938) 303 US 250 a shift of judicial
approach is discernible. It was there held that a privilege tax upon the gross receipts of those
engaged in certain specified business was valid though the business may be of an inter-State
character. Such a tax should be scrutinised to see whether it is one which may be imposed by
another State on the same activity or transaction and thus carries the risk of a cumulative or
multiple tax burden. In the absence of such a risk the tax would be unobjectionable. Stone, J.,
observed that it was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in inter-State
commerce from their just share of State tax burden even though it increase the cost of doing the
business. This decision paved the way for the recognition of the validity of the use and sales taxes.
58. In McGoldric v. Berwind-White Co. (1940) 309 US 33, it was held that a New York City sales tax
on coal shipped into the city in inter-State commerce and there sold was not unconstitutional. As the
tax did not discriminate against inter-State commerce, it was held to be legal. "Non-discriminatory
taxation of the instrumentalities of inter-State commerce is not prohibited." Where the sale is
completed outside the State, it is not open to the State to impose a sales tax in regard to it. This is
because the State would then be projecting "its powers beyond its boundaries to tax an inter-State
transaction". In the United States, in order to escape from the burden of sales tax, firms may tend to
do business in inter-State commerce. To meet such cases the "use tax" was devised by the States.
The State commonly levied a 2 or 3 per cent tax for the privilege of "use" on goods imported into the
State, and exempt from the sales tax. That the use as distinct from the out-of-State sale could be
taxed, was laid down in Nelson v. Sears Roebuck & Co. (1941) 312 US 359.
59. It is also not out of the way if we mention the "export and import" clause which contains the
"original package doctrine". Article 1, section 10(2) of the American Constitution is in these terms :
'No State shall without the consent of the Congress, lay any imposts and duties on imports or
exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws". The scope of
this clause was considered by Marshall, C.J., in Brown v. State of Maryland (1827) 12 US 419; 6 L Ed
678. In that case, a statute of Maryland, provided that all importers of foreign articles should obtain
a license on payment of a prescribed fee before they sold the goods and the applicant was convicted
under the Act for selling imported goods without taking out a licence. The tax was held to be
opposed to section 10(2) as it was in substance a tax on imports. It was contended that as soon as
the goods entered the State they ceased to be imports and were therefore liable to be taxed by the
State like other goods within its jurisdiction. Marshall, C.J., declared that whenever imported goods
became "mixed up with the mass of property in country", they became subject to State's taxing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 28National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
power, but that as long a the goods remained the property of the importer and "in the original form
or package" any State tax upon them constituted an unconstitutional interference with the Federal
taxing power. He observed :
"While we admit that there must be a point of time when the prohibition ceases and
the power of the State of tax commences, we cannot admit that this point of time is
the instant that the articles enter the country. It is sufficient for the present to say
generally that when the importer has so acted upon the thing imported that it has
become incorporated and mixed up with the mass of property in the country, it has
perhaps lost its distinctive character as an import and has become subject to the
taxing power of the State; but while remaining the property of the importer in his
warehouse in the original form or package in which it was imported, a tax upon it is
too plainly a duty on import to escape the prohibition of the Constitution. The right
to import includes the right to sell it in the original bags before it loses its distinctive
character as an import. So, the first sale within the State in the original packages
should be exempt from taxation by the State."
In the instant case, it is common ground that the diamonds have been the subject-matter of the
auction by the fall of the hammer and the said packets containing diamonds are sealed by the
auctioneers as well as by the person who has been successful in his bid and as such, can this aspect
alone give all the characteristics of a completed sale, thereby making the transaction liable to be
taxed by the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act, is the question which confronts us. In meeting the
said question, we have no hesitation to hold that a contract had been entered into between the
parties herein, namely, the auctioneer and the successful bidder, that 25 per cent of the auction
amount for which the successful bid had been struck, has to be paid at Madras and that the balance
be paid at Bombay. The said 25 per cent of the bid amount is also considered as a deposit. As a
matter of fact, the word use for this 25 per cent of the amount that is being actually expected to be
paid by the successful bidder soon after the auction is over, is called "security deposit".
60. Coming back to the original package doctrine, we find that in McGoldric v. Berwind-White Co.
(1940) 309 US 33; 84 L Ed 565 (Vide also Woodroff v. Parham 75 US 123; 19 L Ed 383, Hinson v.
Lott 75 US 148; 19 L Ed 387; but see McLeod v. Dilworth (1944) 322 US 327.) it was held that a New
York City sales tax on coal shipped into the city in inter-State commerce and there sold was not
unconstitutional. Stone, J., observed therein :
"This court has uniformly sustained a tax imposed by the State of the buyer upon a
sale of goods, in several instance in the original package effected by delivery to the
purchaser upon arrival at destination after an inter-State journey, both when the
local seller had purchased the goods extra-State the purpose of resale and when the
extra-State seller had shipped them into the taxing-State for sale there."
61. This decision establishes the principle that the doctrine of original packages has no application
to inter-State commerce.

62. This doctrine of original package has no application to India. In Province of Madras v. Boddu
Paidanna & Sons [1942] 1 STC 104 (FC); 1942 MWN 574; (1942) 2 MLJ 327 (FC), Sir Maurice
Gwyer, C.J., observed :
"I should much regret if any contribution of mine to the elucidation of the problems
which come before this court were thought to have included the introduction of some
kind of 'original package' doctrine and all the refinements and complications which
that doctrine has brought in its train in the courts of America."
63. That doctrine of original package is not to be applied in this country.
In the instant case, we have no hesitation to observe that the package of diamonds and the sealing
thereof and its subsequent journey from Madras to Bombay and the further formalities do not
contribute vary much for the determination of the transaction, as to whether it conforms to the
requirements of inter-State commerce or not.
64. Under article 286, clause (1) of the Constitution, two classes of sales are exempted from the
imposition of sales tax. The first is a sale which has taken place outside the State. The second is a
sale that has taken place "in the course of" the import of the goods into or the export of the goods
out of the territory of India. The significance of the words "in the course of" was considered in
Bombay Co. v. State [1952] 3 STC 91 (TC); AIR 1952 TC 83. In that case, cashewnuts were purchased
locally in Travancore-Cochin for the purpose of exporting them to foreign countries after submitting
them to a special treatment in the factory of the purchaser. It was held by the Travancore-Cochin
High Court that the purchase was only an integral part to the process of exporting and that the sales
in question, though they had been completed before the export actually commenced, fell within the
purview of article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution and were beyond the reach of the taxing power of the
State. On the scope and meaning of article 286(1)(b), Kunhiraman, J., observed as follows :
"The words 'in the course of' make the scope of this clause very wide. It is not
restricted to the point of time at which goods are imported into or exported from
India. The series of transactions which necessarily precede export or import of goods
will come within the purview of this clause. Therefore, while in the course of that
series of transactions the sale has taken place, such a sale is exempted from the levy
of sales tax. The sale may have taken place within the boundaries of the State. Even
then, sales tax cannot be levied if the sale had taken place while the goods were in the
course of import into India or in the course of export out of India. We are stressing
this point because both parties in what we may describe as the cashewnut cases
entered into a lengthy discussion as to the exact point of time when the sale became
completed and as to the exact place where the goods were when the sale became a
completed transaction."
65. On appeal, to the Supreme Court, the above decision of the Kerala High Court was affirmed.
Patanjali Sastri, I. (as he then was), observed thus :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 30National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
"We are clearly of opinion that the sales here in question, which occasioned the
export in each case, fall within the scope of the exemption under article 286(1)(b),
Such sales must of necessity be put through by transporting the goods by rail or ship
or both out of the territory of India, that is to say, by employing the machinery of
export. A sale by export thus involves a series of integrated activities commencing
from the agreement of sale with a foreign buyer and ending with the delivery of the
goods to a common carrier for transport out of the country by land or sea. Such a sale
cannot be dissociated from the export without which it cannot be effectuated, and the
sale and resultant export form parts of a single transaction. Of these two integrated
activities, which together constitution an export sale, whichever first occurs can well
be regarded as taking palace in the course of the other. Assuming, without deciding,
that the property in the goods in the present cases passed to the foreign buyers and
the sales were thus completed within the State before the goods commenced their
journey as found by the sales tax authorities, the sales must, nevertheless, be
regarded as having taken place in the course of the export and are, therefore, exempt
under article 286(1)(b). The clause, indeed, assumes that the sale has taken place
within the limits of the State and exempts it if it takes place in the course of the
export of the goods concerned ...... We accordingly hold that whatever else may or
may not fall within article 286(1)(b), sales and purchases which themselves occasion
the export of the goods, as the case may be, out of or into the territory of India, come
within the exemption and that is enough to dispose of these appeals."
66. This Court in Govindarajulu Naidu & Co. v. State of Madras [1952] 3 STC 405; 1952 MWN 878
came to the conclusion that "export" cannot be construed as including purchases prior to the
transaction under which the goods are exported. In view of the decision of the Supreme Court, above
referred to [State of Kerala v. Bombay Co. [1952] 3 STC 434; (1952) 65 LW 1087], this view is not
tenable. Sales and purchases which occasion the export and exempt from taxation by the State.
In the instant case, we are very much concerned with the phrase "occasioning the transaction" as
contemplated by section 3(a) of the Act. Viewing the transaction in question, bearing in mind this
concept incorporated in the provision of section 3(a), we have no hesitation in holding that the
transaction in question falls within the category of inter-State transaction and, as such, is liable to be
taxed only under the provisions of the Central Sales Tax Act, and not under the Tamil Nadu General
Sales Tax Act. We have set out supra comprehensively the facts of this case and as such, viewing the
entire transaction and testing the same with the ratio decidendi in Consolidated Coffee Ltd. v. Coffee
Board , we hold that the transaction in the instant case is an inter-State transaction. The Tribunal
has not addressed itself to the issue whether the sale occasioned the movement of the goods from
Tamil Nadu to Bombay, and had simply rested its conclusion on the finding that the property in the
goods, namely, diamonds, passed in favour of the purchaser in Madras. Bearing in mind the
decision in Balabhagas Hulaschand v. State of Orissa and the decision in Union of India v. Khosla &
Co. Ltd. , we are of the opinion that there is movement of the goods and it does not matter where the
property passed, so far as the determination of the nature of the transaction, whether it is
intra-State transaction or inter-State transaction, is concerned. The facts in this case clearly
establish that the parties contemplated movement of the goods and buyers, in the instant case, are
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/945198/ 31National Mineral Development ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 January, 1987
having no residence at Madras, nor do they have any place of business of their own at Madras.
Therefore, the logical inference that can be arrived at is that there has been movement of the goods
which was the life-string of the instance, culminating in the contact of sale. Factually, there has been
movement of the goods by the revision petitioners to the trade location at Bombay. Under these
circumstances, we hold that the Tribunal is not correct in having held the transaction as an
intra-State one and as such, taxable under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act.
We set aside the order of the Tribunal. We hold that the transactions involved in the case are
inter-State sales and as such, taxable under the provision of the Central Sales Tax Act. We allow
both the revisions with costs. Counsel's fee is fixed at Rs. 500 (Rupees five hundred only) One set.
Petitions allowed.
