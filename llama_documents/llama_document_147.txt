ORDER
G. Yethirajulu, J.
1. This is a reference made by a learned single Judge of this Court, through the order dated
21-12-2001. The following are the questions to be answered by this Bench:
1. Whether the concept of attornment of tenancy governed by the general provisions
of Transfer of Property Act and lessor and lessee relationship be applied to the rent
control proceedings under the A.P. Buildings (Lease, Rent & Eviction) Control Act,
1960?
2. Whether the denial of title can be said to be mala fide in the light of Ex.R-2 and the
evidence of R.W.1 to R.W.4 in the present case?
2. The matter covered by the above revision petition relates to a dispute under Andhra Pradesh
Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1960 (for short 'the Rent Control Act'),
3. We wish to answer the first question, but we are not inclined to answer the second question,
which is touching upon the facts of the case.
4. It has to be examined whether the concept of attornment of tenancy governed by the general
principle of lessor and lessee relationship under the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, can
be extended to the proceedings under the provisions of the Rent Control Act.
5. 'Attornment' as defined in Legal Glossary (1998 Edition) issued by the Ministry of Law & Justice,
reads as follows.
To attorn" merely means to acknowledge the relation of a tenant to a new landlord. Therefore,
"attornment by the tenant would mean acceptance of the new owner as landlord and estopping the
tenant to dispute the landlord's title thereafter. Of course, attornment had to be in good faith and
not on account of any deception caused on the tenant. Payment or non-payment to a new landlord
does not affect the relationship created by attornment. "Attornment" also implies continuity of
tenancy, though landlord might change when title of the property passes by sale or otherwise.

6. Section 109 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 ensures the rights available to a lessor's
transferee. It reads as follows:
Right of lessor's transferee.- If the lessor transfers the property leased, or any part
thereof, or any part of his interest therein, the transferee, in the absence of a contract
to the contrary, shall possess all. the rights, and, if the lessee so elects, be subject to
all the liabilities of the lessor as to the property or part transferred so long as he is the
owner of it; but the lessor shall not, by reason only of such transfer cease to be
subject to any of the liabilities imposed upon him by the lease, unless the lessee elects
to treat the transferee as the person liable to him;
Provided that the transferee is not entitled to arrears of rent due before the transfer,
and that, if the lessee, not having reason to believe that such transfer has been made,
pays rent to the lessor, the lessee shall not be liable to pay such rent over again to the
transferee.
The lessor, the transferee and the lessee may determine what proportion of the
premium or rent reserved by the lease is payable in respect of the part so transferred,
and, in case they disagree such determination may be made by any Court having
jurisdiction to entertain a suit for the possession of the property leased.
7. Under the Common Law of England, attornment by the lessee to the assignee was necessary to
complete the assignment of the landlord's interest, unless the assignment was by will. This seems to
have been recognized in an old decision in 1870 in Ram Lall Misser v. Chunderbullee 1870 13 WR
228 Sections 9 and 10 of the Statute 4, 5 Anne c. 3, (now re-enacted in Section 151(1) of the Law of
Property Act, 1925) dispensed with such attornment. Our Act also does not insist on a fresh
attornment (see Mulla on the Transfer of Property Act - Sixth Edition).
8. In the light of Section 109 of the Transfer of Property Act, we wish to verify the decisions rendered
by various courts on this aspect.
9. In Daulat Ram v. Haveli Sah AIR 1939 Lahore 49, the Lahore High Court held that afresh
attornment by the lessee to the landlord's assignee is not necessary under the Transfer of Property
Act.
10. In Pulin Behari Shaw v. Lila Dey ILR (1958) 2 Calcutta 427, a Division Bench of the Calcutta
High Court held that under the Indian Law a letter of attornment is not necessary to complete the
title of the assignee of the reversion.
11. In Uppalapati Veera Venkata Satyanarayanaraju and Anr. v. Josyula Hanumayamma the
Supreme Court held that once the tenant has agreed to accept the person claiming title from the
previous landlord that amounts to effective attornment in favour of the landlord and is no more
dependent on the future conduct of the tenant by way of payment of rent or otherwise.

12. In Pallapothu Narasimha Rao and Anr. v. Kidanoi Radhakrishamacharyulu (F.B.), a Full Bench
of Andhra Pradesh High Court while considering the rights of the transferee from the original
landlord held as follows:
Section 2(6) defines 'landlord' meaning the owner of a building and includes a person
who is receiving and who is entitled to receive rent of a building, it is clear therefore
that the definition of 'landlord' would include not only the original owner but every
person who becomes the owner of the building by reason of transfer or otherwise.
The transferee would therefore be also a landlord within the meaning of Section 2(6)
and would be entitled to continue the proceedings initiated by the original owner.
13. In Ram Swarup v. Darshan Singh AIR 1984 Allahabad (NOC) 178, the plaintiff is a purchaser of
land of which the defendant is a tenant before the purchase. The defendant, however, did not either
attorn or acknowledge the plaintiff as the landlord. The Allahabad High Court held that in the
plaintiff's suit for possession, the defendant cannot plead that the suit is bad for want of a notice
under Section 106 terminating the tenancy.
14. In Hajee K. Assainar and Co. v. Chacko Joseph , a learned single Judge of Kerala High Court
while answering the following questions held as follows:
1. There is no subsisting tenancy between the tenant and the transferee, as the tenant
has not attorned to the transferee after the transfer in his favour.
2. The transfer made in favour of the transferee by his father is only a sham
document.
A transferee of the landlord's rights steps into the shoes of the landlord with all the rights and
liabilities of the transferor landlord in respect of the subsisting tenancy. The section also protects
payment of rent by the tenant to the transferor without notice of the transfer. The section does not
insist that the transfer of the landlord's rights can take effect only if the tenant attorns. Attornment
by the tenant is unnecessary to confer validity to the transfer of the landlord's rights. The
attornment being unnecessary the tenant cannot dispute the right of transferee landlord to maintain
application for eviction or to claim rent.
15. The question of attornment was again considered by a learned single Judge of Patna High Court
in Dinesh Kumar Purbey v. Mahesh Kumar Poddar 1991 (1) PLJR 650 (Patna), wherein it was held
that in a case of eviction of the tenant on the ground of personal necessity, an attornment by lessee
is not necessary for creating a relationship of landlord and tenant between the transferee of the
landlord and the tenant and further observed as follows:
In my considered opinion, attornment is not a necessary condition to create landlord
tenant relationship between the parties. It has no bearing whatsoever in cases of
eviction on the ground of personal necessity. The transfer takes place with all
incidents of right, title and interest of the lessor and the transferee is entitled to sue
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/92184215/ 3Shankaramma And Ors. vs Mohammed Abdul Hameed And Anr. on 28 October, 2005
the existing tenant on the ground of personal necessity even if the tenant has not
attorned to his tenancy under him.
16. In Santi Lal Saha v. Sudhir Kumar Roy 1992 C.W.N. 215 (D.B.), a Division Bench of Calcutta
High Court while dealing with Section 109 of the Transfer of Property Act held as follows:
Under Section 109 of the Transfer of Property Act the transferee, in the absence of a
contract to the contrary, shall possess all the rights of the lessor on transfer by the
lessor. Under the said provision, fresh attornment by the lessee to the lessor's
assignee may not be required, but in practice attornment is generally insisted upon as
it is useful as an acknowledgement of the tenancy. In view of the said section, the
assignee of the lessor has as against the lessee all the rights the lessor had including
the right to receive the rent in terms of the lease and the lessee cannot say that he is
not bound to pay the same to the assignee merely because there is no privity of
contract. Section 109 of the Transfer of Property Act further entitled a lessor to evict
the lessee on termination of the lease, even if there is no attornment.
17. In Smt. Kalawati Tripathi and Ors. v. Smt. Damayanti Devi and Anr. (D.B.) a Division Bench of
Patna High Court in a case under Bihar Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act (4 of 1982)
also considered Section 109 of the Transfer of Property Act and held as follows:
Attainment is a creature of contract. It is not a mere agreement in favour of a third
party to pay rents but has been defined as an act of the tenant putting one person in
the place of another as his landlord. It is clear from Section 109 of T.P. Act that after
the transfer of lessor's right in favour of the transferee he gets all the rights and
liabilities of the lessor in respect of the subsisting tenancy. This section does not
insist that the transfer will take effect only when the tenant attorns. The provisions of
this section give a validity to the transfer made by the lessor with regard to his right
in favour of the transferee regarding the subsisting tenancy.
An attornment by lessee to the assignee of lessor is not necessary for creating a
subsisting tenancy. The transferee of the lessee steps into the shoes and possess all
the rights, which the transferor has. the attornment by tenant is not essential to give
validity to the transfer made in favour of the transferee. The submissions made on
behalf of the tenant that the suit for eviction was not maintainable, as there was no
attornment by the tenant, therefore is without any substance.
18. In Mohd. Ilyas and Anr. v. Mohd. Adil and Ors. (D.B.) a Division Bench of Delhi High Court
dealt with Section 109 of the Transfer of Property Act and explained the word 'attornment'. The
attornment by the tenant would mean acceptance of the new owner as landlord and estopping the
tenant to dispute the landlord's title thereafter. Payment or non-payment to a new landlord does not
affect the relationship created by attornment. 'Attornment' also implies continuity of tenancy,
though landlord might change when title of the property passes by sale or otherwise.

19. In Mohar Singh v. Devi Charan (1988) 3 CC 63, the Supreme Court held as follows:
It is a trite proposition that a landlord cannot split the unity and integrity of the
tenancy and recover possession of a part of the demised premises from the tenant.
But Section 109 of the Transfer of Property Act provides a statutory exception to this
rule and enables an assignee of a part of the reversion to exercise all the rights of the
landlord in respect of the portion respecting which the reversion is so assigned
subject, of course, to the other covenant running with the land. This is the true effect
of the words 'shall possess all the rights...of the lessor as to the property or part
transferred ..." occurring in Section 109 of the T.P. Act. There is no need for a
consensual attornment. the attornment is brought about by operation of law. The
limitation on the right of the landlord against splitting up of the integrity of the
tenancy, inhering in the inhibitions of his own contract, does not visit the assignee of
the part of the reversion. There is no need for the consent of the tenant for the
severance of the reversion and the assignment of the part so severed. This
proposition is too well settled to require any further elucidation or reiteration.
20. In Bhan Madan v. II Additional District Judge and Ors. , a three Judge Bench of the Supreme
Court held that when the tenant attorned the tenancy in favour of the purchaser of the premises and
paid rents throughout the period during which the purchaser's interest subsisted, he cannot assail
the purchaser's title by asserting that the sale in favour of the purchaser was void and conveyed
nothing. In the case covered by the above decision, the premises in question originally belonged one
Shambhoolal Jain. He died in 1943 leaving behind him, his wife, his two sons, Dayachand and
Dhoomchand and a daughter Mainavati. Dayachand went in adoption to the family of his junior
paternal uncle. Mainavati obtained money decree against Dhoomchand and after bringing the
premises for sale purchased the same in a court auction. Mainvati thereafter conveyed the property
by sale in favour of the purchaser, Gopinath Agarwal. The tenant who was in occupation of the
premises since prior to the sale attorned the tenancy in favour of the purchaser and came to pay the
rents to the purchaser accordingly. The purchaser, Gopinath Agarwal in turn sold the property in
favour of Chhaya Gupta. When notices were issued by Gopinath Agarwal and Chhaya Gupta to
attorn the tenancy in favour of the purchaser, Chhya Gupta, the tenant declined to do so and
assailed not only the derivative title of Chhaya Gupta to the property but also the validity of the sale
in favour of Gopinath Agarwal himself and also sought to raise the defect in Mainavati's title. In the
above set of circumstances, the Supreme Court gave the above judgment by holding that the
appellant cannot assail Gupta's title after the attornment of the tenancy by paying rents.
21. If the transfer of the landlord's right is valid, and even if the tenant has not attorned in favour of
the transferee, the lease continues, the lessee will be entitled to the statutory protection under the
Rent Control Act. He cannot be evicted except in accordance with the provisions of that Act. This is
abundantly made clear from the definition of 'landlord' under Section 2 (vi) of the Rent Control Act,
which reads as follows:
'Landlord' means the owner of a building and includes a person who is receiving or is
entitled to receive the rent of a building, whether on his own account or on behalf of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/92184215/ 5Shankaramma And Ors. vs Mohammed Abdul Hameed And Anr. on 28 October, 2005
another person or on behalf of himself and others or as an agent, trustee, executor,
administrator, receiver or guardian or who would so receive the rent or be entitled to
receive the rent, if the building were let to a tenant.
22. The transferee of a landlord is thus entitled to collect rent as of right and he is a landlord under
the inclusive definition. Since the attornment is not necessary under Section 109 of the Transfer of
Property Act, the tenant cannot dispute the right of transferee to maintain a suit for eviction or to
claim rent.
23. A transferee of the landlord's rights steps into the shoes of the transferor-landlord with all the
rights and liabilities in respect of the subsisting tenancy. The section does not insist that the transfer
of the landlord's rights can take effect only if the tenant attorns. Attornment by the tenant being
unnecessary to confer validity on the transfer of the landlord's rights, the tenant cannot dispute the
right of the transferee-landlord to maintain an application for eviction or to claim rent.
24. Section 109 of the Transfer of Property Act makes it clear that the landlord can transfer his
property in favour of a third party during the subsistence of the lease. The consent of tenant is not
necessary to transfer the property in favour of a third party.
25. In the light of the provisions of Transfer of Property Act and the above case law, we hold that the
attornment automatically follows on transfer of property on the same terms and conditions on
which the transferor entered into lease agreement with the tenant unless there is a contract to the
contrary. There is no specific provision under the Rent Control Act providing for a situation contrary
to Section 109 of the Transfer of Property Act.
26. in the light of the views expressed by various courts and after analyzing the above data, we hold
that the concept of attornment of tenancy governed by the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act
and the lessor and lessee relationship are applicable to the proceedings under the A.P. Buildings
(Lease, Rent & Eviction) Control Act, 1960.
27. The reference is accordingly answered in respect of point The file may be placed before the
Bench, which has the provision for disposal according to law.
