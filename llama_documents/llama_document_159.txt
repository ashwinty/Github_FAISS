CORAM: HONOURABLE MS. JUSTICE HARSHA DEVANI and HONOURABLE MS.
JUSTICE SONIA GOKANI Date : 08/05/2015 (PER : HONOURABLE MS. JUSTICE
HARSHA DEVANI)
1. All these petitions involve similar questions of fact and law and the parties are also
common, and hence, the same were taken up for hearing together and are decided by
this common judgment. In all, there are three petitioners, viz.
British Gas Exploration and Production India Limited, Reliance Industries Limited, and the Oil and
Natural Gas Corporation Limited, who are collectively known as "the Contractor". All the three
petitioners have filed individual petitions challenging orders passed by the Sales Tax Department
against them. For the sake of convenience, reference is made to the facts as stated in Special Civil
Application No.2084/2004 which has been filed by British Gas Exploration and Production India
Limited. Wherever the facts are different, reference shall be made to the same at an appropriate
stage.
2. The petitioner - British Gas Exploration and Production India Limited (hereinafter referred to as
"BGEPIL") is engaged in the business of exploration and production of oil and gas. On 22nd
December, 1994, the Government of India, BGEPIL, Reliance Industries Limited (hereinafter
referred to as "RIL") and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (hereinafter referred to as
"ONGCL") agreed and executed two Production Sharing Contracts for development and exploration
of Panna- Mukta and Mid-South Tapti Oil and Gas fields, in the west-coast off shore, India. Under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 3B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
the terms of the Production Sharing Contract (hereinafter referred to as "the PSC"), ONGCL, RIL
and BGEPIL are collectively called "the Contractor". The Panna- Mukta gas production started from
February, 1998 onwards.
3. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the Production Sharing Contract for pursuing
activities relating to exploration and exploiting oil and gas in Panna-Mukta oil/gas fields in the
economic zone, the Union of India granted a licence to the joint venture. The terms of this grant are
recorded in the PSC for Panna-Mukta oil/gas fields dated 22 nd December, 1994. Under the terms of
the contract, the ONGCL is entitled to share 40% of production of the minerals extracted and
BGEPIL and RIL are to share 30% each of such production. The Panna-Mukta oil/gas fields are
located in the area of economic zone as defined in the Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf,
Exclusive Economic Zone and other Maritime Zones Act, 1976 (hereinafter referred to as "the
Maritime Act"). Thus, the location of the said oil/gas fields is beyond the territorial waters of India.
4. It is the case of the petitioners that under the PSC, the Contractor or any constituent thereof has
no right to dispose of the natural gas produced by them. The entire production is the property of the
Union of India, but, for the sake of providing adequate compensation to the Contractor, certain
terms have been arrived at. Article 27 of the PSC clearly shows the title to the petroleum data and
assets belongs to the Government of India and specifies that the Government is the sole owner of the
petroleum products. The joint venture is merely a contract for exploration and production of natural
gas as is clear from Article 27.1 of the PSC. Under the contract, the joint venture consisting of
BGEPIL, RIL and ONGCL has a limited right of extraction and limited title to supply to the
Government as more specifically set out therein. The entire production of natural gas goes to the
Government of India and the Contractor or any constituted thereof have no control and no
independence or volition to dispose of any mineral and are bound to hand over the production of
natural gas to the Government of India. The PSC, therefore, is a contract arrived at for acquisition
and disposal of minerals by the Government of India, who in public interest and the interest of
consumers, controls the production, prices and distribution of natural gas.
5. The Government of India appointed Gas Authority of India Limited (hereinafter referred to as
"GAIL") as its nominee to take over the natural gas produced by the Contractor on behalf of the
Government of India. The Contractor delivered the natural gas to ONGCL for transportation and
re-delivery of the same to GAIL. Natural Gas is separated from condensates at the oil fields and also
measured under sophisticated equipment at the oil fields itself. The delivery is thereafter taken by
ONGCL from the Contractor at the off-shore tie-in point into the ONGCL pipeline itself for and on
behalf of GAIL in terms of the final delivery point in the said PSC. ONGCL, therefore, takes delivery
on behalf of GAIL and undertakes to transport the said Natural Gas to Hazira for handing over to
GAIL. It is the case of the petitioners that in the nature of the peculiar transport arrangement under
sea water and commercial expediency, ONGCL transports the Natural Gas again mixed with its own
gas. The pipeline, therefore, contains Natural Gas of which ONGCL has taken delivery from the joint
venture as also its own Natural Gas as also similar gas of others, there being no facilities to carry
Natural Gas of particular ownership separately in a separate pipe.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 4B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
6. It is further the case of the petitioners that the pipeline of ONGCL carrying Natural Gas of GAIL
and others passes through a processing plant belonging to ONGCL at Hazira. Since there is no other
way of physical transfer of gas by ONGCL to GAIL, the said pipeline passes through the processing
plant of ONGCL at Hazira. The said processing plant functions to remove Sulphur and other
impurities from Natural Gas. GAIL, therefore, takes possession of the Natural Gas as processed in
the processing plant of ONGCL from its transporter ONGCL. The pricing of the Natural Gas
produced at the oil fields and delivered to GAIL depends on the international market of gas and oil
and is a specialised job entrusted to experts for working out the said price on the basis of a
complicated formula as provided in the provision about price of Natural Gas in the said chapter of
the PSC.
7. The petitioner - BGEPIL had been submitting its sales tax returns to the respondent as well as tax
officers from time to time. At the time of assessment, the petitioner No.1 disclosed all facts including
Balance Sheet, the reports of the total production and the like. The natural gas production of Panna
and Mukta also was separately recorded in a statement. It is the case of the petitioner - BGEPIL that
though sales of Natural Gas produced from Panna-Mukta were disclosed by the petitioner, since the
same were not amenable to sales tax, the petitioner had not shown the figures in the respective
returns, but had submitted separately complete data in the course of assessment proceedings, which
had been appreciated and no tax was levied. It is the case of the petitioner - BGEPIL that the
respondent Commissioner had examined the legal character of these transactions in the preceding
years. The petitioner - BGEPIL had in several correspondences, personal visits, personal
appearance, and otherwise, conveyed to the respondent Sales Tax authorities that these transactions
were protected by Article 286 of the Constitution and could not be taxed. By a notice dated 7th
January, 2002, the Additional Commissioner of Sales Tax (Enforcement), Surat called upon the
petitioner - BGEPIL to explain why the sales should not be taxed, pursuant to which, the said
petitioner submitted a detailed reply explaining as to why such sales should not be taxed. The
Additional Commissioner, however, issued a notice purporting to be a show-cause notice calling
upon the said petitioner to show cause why supply of Natural Gas from Panna-Mukta oil/gas fields
to GAIL, should not be taxed. The petitioner submitted its reply by letters dated 28th January, 2002
and 4th March, 2002. It is alleged in the petition that the second respondent Commissioner has,
notwithstanding the clear position of law, adopted a resolute attitude to tax these transactions of the
Joint Venture and has directed the respective assessing authorities to impose tax on these
transactions by resorting to reassessments or provisional assessments as the case may be in case of
each respective constituent of the Joint Venture. Pursuant to these directions, the fifth and sixth
respondents issued notice for reassessment under section 44 of the Gujarat Sales Tax Act, 1969
(hereinafter referred to as "the GST Act"). Similar notices also came to be issued to RIL and ONGCL.
In response to the notices, the first petitioner gave very specific and detailed reply and also pointed
out that the sale of Gas under the GST was liable to tax at the last stage, that is, when the Gas is
distributed to the actual consumer. Therefore, the supply to GAIL which is the sole distributor of the
Gas cannot be taxed. The first petitioner also appeared before the respective officers, submitted its
written reply and got its objections recorded in the proceedings. The respondent authorities,
however, passed re-assessment orders in the case of all the petitioners namely, BGEPIL, ONGCL
and RIL. It appears that the petitioner - BGEPIL had preferred appeal against the orders of
re-assessment before the Commissioner of Sales Tax with a request to direct the officers to desist
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 5B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
from recovering the astronomical recoveries taken out by them. However, the petitioner came to
learn that the authorities were directed not to grant any stay or pass any order on the stay
application that had been filed by the said petitioner. Convinced that the appellate authority had no
discretion to decide against the directions of the Commissioner to assess the disputed transactions,
the said petitioner approached the Commissioner of Sales Tax, Ahmedabad and requested him not
to enforce the demand. The petitioner thereafter learnt that its bank account with the State Bank of
India, Bhavnagar was attached by the respondent Sales Tax Officer on 12th February, 2004. It is at
this stage that the petitioners have approached this court challenging the re-assessment orders and
demand notices; seeking a declaration that the supplies of Natural Gas by the Contractor to the
Government of India cannot be taxed in terms of Article 286 of the Constitution read with section 5
of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956; and for permanently restraining the respondents No.1 to 6 or
their servants or agents from in any way levying tax on the transaction of supply of Natural Gas to
the Government of India in terms of the provisions of the PSC.

appropriate writ, direction or order under Article 226 of the Constitution quashing and setting aside
the assessment order dated 30th March, 2009 passed by the Respondent No.3 for the F.Y. 2004-05.
9. Mr. P. Chidambaram, Senior Advocate, learned counsel for the petitioner - BG Exploration and
Production India Ltd. assailed the impugned orders by submitting that such orders had been passed
without any authority in law as the sales in question have not taken place within the State of Gujarat
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 7B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
and, therefore, are not amenable to tax under the GST Act. It was submitted that there are
limitations on the power of a State Government to impose sales tax. Under Article 286 of the
Constitution, a State cannot impose sales tax where the sale takes place -
(a) outside the State; or
(b) in the course of import of goods into the territory of India. Under sub-Article (2) of Article 286, it
is only the Parliament which can formulate principles for determining when a sale can take place in
any of the two ways mentioned above, which has been done by the Parliament by enacting the
Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as "the CST Act"). Accordingly, Section 4 of the
CST Act states as to when a sale is said to take place outside a State and section 5 thereof states
when a sale is said to take place in the course of import and section 87 of the GST Act also reflects
the above position. Inviting attention to the Explanation to section 87 of the GST Act, it was pointed
out that the same requires that for the purpose of the section, whether a sale takes place in the
course of any inter-State trade or commerce, or outside the State of Gujarat or in the course of
import of the goods into the territory of India or export of goods outside such territory shall be
determined in accordance with the principles specified in sections 3, 4 and 5 of the CST Act.
9.1 It was submitted that the power of the State Government to impose sales tax is only if the goods
are within the State at a certain point of time. By virtue of section 4 of the CST Act, a sale shall be
deemed to take place inside a State if the goods are within the State -
(a) in the case of specific or ascertained goods, at the time the contract of sale is made; and
(b) in case of unascertained or future goods, at the time of their appropriation to the contract of sale
by the seller or by the buyer, whether assent of the other party is prior upon subsequent to such
appropriation.
It was submitted that it is this position that is reflected in the Explanation 1 to sub-section (28) of
section 2 of the GST Act which defines 'sale'. The learned counsel further submitted that the
principles contained in sub-section (2) of section 4 of the CST Act are very simple principles,
namely:
(a) in case of specific or ascertained goods, the only relevant factor is the situs of the
goods when the contract of sale is made; and
(b) in case of unascertained or future goods, the only relevant factor is the situs of the
goods when they are appropriated to the contract of sale by the seller or by the buyer.
9.2 It was submitted that in the facts of the present case, the sale of the goods, namely, Natural Gas
under the PSC took place outside the State of Gujarat since none of the conditions under section
4(2) of the CST Act are satisfied. It was pointed out that the territory of "India" has been defined in
the Constitution of India in Article 1(3) which states that the territory of India shall comprise of
States and Union Territories and such other territories as may be acquired. There is, however, no
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 8B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
reference to the territorial waters in Article 1. 'State' has been defined under Article 1(2) of the
Constitution of India to mean the territories that are specified in the First Schedule of the
Constitution of India. The territory of Gujarat is stated to be the territories specified in section 3(1)
of the Bombay State Reorganization Act, 1960 under Entry 4 of the First Schedule. When read with
section 3(1) of the Bombay State Reorganization Act, 1960, the territory of the State of Gujarat is
extended to cover the following territories:-
"(a) Banaskantha, Mehsana, Sabarkantha, Ahmedabad, Kaira, Panchmahals, Baroda,
Broach, Surat, Dangs, Amreli, Surendranagar, Rajkot, Jamnagar, Junagadh,
Bhavnagar and Kutch districts and
(b) the villages in Umbergaontaluka of Thana district, the villages in Nawapur and
Nandurbartalukas of West Khandesh district and villages in Akkalkuwa and
Talodatalukas of West Khandesh district, respectively specified in Parts I, II and III
of the First Schedule."
It was submitted that the Panna-Mukta Gas Wells Offshore Platform and the location on the High
Seas where the petitioners' pipeline from the Offshore Platform meets ONGC's pipeline (laid from
Bassein to Hazira) are not included within the territory of the State of Gujarat. Therefore, the Gas
Wells, the Offshore Platform and the T-Junction are all outside the territory of the State of Gujarat.
It was submitted that the only contract in the present case is the Production Sharing Contract (PSC)
and the subject matter of the contract is "Associated Natural Gas" (ANG) and Excess ANG. Under
Article 21.4.1 of the PSC, ANG minus what is used by the contractor in accordance with Article 21.2
of the PSC, is Excess ANG. Under Article 21.4.3, Excess ANG shall first be offered for sale to the
Government of India or its nominee and under Article 21.4.4, the Government of India may exercise
its option to purchase the Excess ANG, and the contractor and the Government of India or its
nominee shall agree on the terms for the sale. The price of ANG is governed by Article 21.5.13. The
price shall be specified in the Gas Sales Contract, which shall be in accordance with the provisions of
Article 21.5.13. It was pointed out that Article 21.5.13(a)(iii) defines 'Deliverability' which is in terms
of volume of gas calculated as the lesser of two indices: (i) maximum aggregate of all wells and (ii)
maximum delivery capacity of the processing facility. This processing facility is the Offshore
Processing Platform of the contractor. It was submitted that the ONGC's facility at Hazira is always
referred to as the "separation and sweetening facility owned and operated by ONGC". Under the
contract, specifically Article 21.5.13(b) of the PSC, the seller has agreed to produce and deliver, on a
daily basis, to the buyer 100% of the Deliverability of ANG and "Non Associated Natural Gas"
(NANG) at the delivery point and the buyer has agreed to take and purchase, on a
daily basis, 100% of the Deliverability of ANG and NANG. Accordingly, the gas was
delivered at the delivery point in terms of Article 21.5.13(b). It was further submitted
that Article 1.27 and Article 21.5.13(a)(iv) define "Delivery Point" as the upstream
weld at the underwater connection between the seller's pipeline and ONGC's
underwater gas transmission line or lines which transport gas from Bassein field to
the Hazira area. Actually, gas is delivered to one of the two parallel pipelines laid
down by ONGC from the Bassein field to Hazira which is entirely consistent with
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 9B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
Article 1.27 of the PSC. It was submitted that for the purpose of Article 21.5.13(c), the
gas is measured at the Offshore Processing Platform belonging to the petitioner. By
virtue of Article 27.2, title passes to the Government of India or its nominee at the
delivery point. The price of gas is payable for each MMBTU of gas delivered. Under
Article 21.5.13(a)(vi), MMBTU means one million BTUs on a net heating value basis.
The unit is based on 'heat energy'. There is a standard formula to convert a certain "volume" of' gas
into the equivalent "heat energy". Article 21.5.13(d) sets out the formula for calculating the price that
will be paid by the buyer to the seller for the gas delivered under the contract. It was pointed out that
while under Article 21.5.13(b), the seller delivers the 100% Deliverability of gas at the delivery point,
the contract (PSC) provides in Article 21.5.13(e) that "gas is to be received by GAIL at Hazira
downstream of separation and sweetening facilities owned and operated by ONGC". It was pointed
out that this is the only place in the PSC where there is a reference to GAIL, to submit that GAIL
referred to in this sub-clause, is the recipient of gas and not the nominee of the Government of India
because when the PSC was entered into, the Government of India had not appointed GAIL as its
nominee. The Government of India could very well have appointed someone other than GAIL as its
nominee and that GAIL is named as the recipient because it has the largest network of pipelines to
transport gas. Hence, it was convenient to name GAIL as the recipient of gas at Hazira. It was,
accordingly, submitted that the contract of sale is the PSC; the subject matter is gas (ANG and
Excess ANG); the quantity is the "Deliverability" as defined; the gas is delivered at the "Delivery
Point" as defined; the buyer is the Government of India and when the PSC was entered into,
Government of India had not appointed its nominee; and the price is based on unit of equivalent
"heat energy" measured in MMBTU.
9.3 Next it was submitted that the question that now arises for consideration is when does the title
in the goods under the contract pass from the seller to the buyer. The attention of the court was
invited to Article 27.2 of the PSC to submit that the same makes it absolutely clear that the title to
gas sold to the Government of India or its nominee shall pass to the Government of India or its
nominee at the delivery point.
It was submitted that the succeeding sentence, viz.
"Contractor shall be responsible for all costs and risks prior to the delivery point and
each party shall be responsible for all costs and risks associated with such party's
share after the delivery point" places the matter beyond doubt. It was further
submitted that the PSC is the sole contract between the parties. Under Article 34
thereof, it is the "entire agreement".
Referring to Article 34.2, it was pointed out that the PSC cannot be amended, modified, varied or
supplemented in any respect except by an instrument in writing signed by all the parties. It was
submitted that GAIL is not a party to the contract and under Article 21.5.14, any document between
the contractor and GAIL shall not abrogate the obligation of the Government of India under the
PSC. Hence, the Interim Sales Purchase Agreement (ISPA) cannot amount to an amendment or
modification or variation of the PSC. Reliance was placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 10B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
the case of Hindustan Shipyard v. State of Andhra Pradesh, (2006) 6 SCC 579, for the proposition
that it is not the meaning of an individual recital or the inference flowing from any term or condition
of the contract read in isolation, but an overview of the contract wherefrom the nature of the
transaction covered thereby has to be determined. It was submitted that no long term Gas Sales
Contract was entered into between the Contractor and the Government of India or its nominee till
2008. For the intervening period, on 5th February, 1998, the sellers (ONGC, RIL and the petitioner)
and GAIL entered into an Interim Sales and Purchase Agreement (ISPA) without prejudice of any
kind in relation to their respective positions. This ISPA was renewed every year until 2005.
According to the learned counsel, the only purpose of ISPA was to ensure that 90% of the price
specified in Article 21.5.13(d) of the PSC is paid to the sellers (on account basis) upon GAIL
receiving the gas at Hazira. The attention of the court was invited to clause 3 of ISPA which deals
with 'price' and the price stipulated thereunder is 90% of the gas price specified in Article 21.5.13(d)
of the PSC for the net MMBTU of gas delivered at the downstream of ONGC processing facility at
Hazira (on account basis as directed by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas). It was
submitted that this clause is entirely consistent with the language of Article 21.5.13(e). It was urged
that clause 3 of ISPA is not an amendment of Article 21.5.13(iv) which defines 'delivery point',
though, no doubt it uses the word 'delivered' which, in the context, must be understood as 'received'
which is the word used in Article 21.5.13(e). It was submitted that in any event, GAIL not being a
party to the PSC cannot, through a document entered into between the sellers and GAIL, purport to
amend the PSC. The attention of the court was invited to clause 7 of the ISPA to submit that in view
of the provisions thereof, it is beyond doubt that the signing of ISPA does not create a precedent, nor
can it be deemed an admission by any party to the proper interpretation of the PSC or the rights and
obligations of any party thereunder, nor can it be a waiver of any rights of a party under the PSC.
ISPA is an interim agreement to enable parties to calculate the price (on account basis). It does not
deal with the issues that are relevant to section 4 of the CST Act or issues relating to title in the
goods or when and where the title passes from seller to buyer. It was submitted that Article 21.5.14
also makes it clear that nothing contained in any contract entered into by the contractor for the
supply, sale or disposal of gas, with any nominee of the Government, shall in any manner abrogate
the obligation of the Government contained therein. It was submitted that ISPA, therefore, cannot
in any manner amend or abridge or affect the PSC which is the sole contract between the parties.
9.4 According to the learned counsel, the title to the goods passed from the seller to the buyer
(Government of India or its nominee) at the delivery point as defined. The PSC is the sole contract
between the seller and the Government. The goods were always specific or ascertained goods
because the volume of gas to be produced, sold and delivered is captured in the word
"Deliverability" as defined in Article 21.5.13(a)(iii) of the PSC and that all the gas that falls within
"Deliverability" must be sold on a daily basis to the Government of India or its nominee under
Article 21.5.13(b). It was submitted that applying section 4(2)(a) of the CST Act, the goods were
outside the State of Gujarat (gas wells or Offshore Platform) when the contract of sale was made.
Alternatively, it was submitted that assuming that the goods (gas) were unascertained or future
goods, they were appropriated to the contract, on a daily basis, when they were delivered at the
delivery point to ONGC's Bassein - Hazira pipeline. There was appropriation on a daily basis and the
seller and buyer assented to such appropriation. The goods were outside the State of Gujarat at the
time of appropriation (at the delivery point). Therefore, whether section 4(2)(a) or section 4(2)(b) of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 11B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
the CST Act is applied to the case, the sale shall be deemed to have taken place outside the State of
Gujarat. In support of such submission, reliance was placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court
in the case of A.V. Thomas v. Deputy commissioner of Agricultural Income Tax, 1963 Supp (2) SCR
608, to submit that in case of ascertained or specific goods, if the property passes at a situs outside
Gujarat, the State of Gujarat has no authority to levy sales tax. It was submitted that by no stretch of
imagination can it be said that the petitioner had retained title to the property beyond the delivery
point and hence, no property passes in the State of Gujarat and hence, no sales tax can be levied on
the said transaction. Reliance was also placed upon the decision of the Madras High Court in the
case of Bengal Corporation v. State of Madras, (1965) 16 STC 62. The decision of the Delhi High
Court in the case of K.G. Khosla and Company Pvt. Ltd. vs. Chief Commissioner, Union Territory of
Delhi, (1972) 30 STC 13, was relied upon wherein the court has held that the term 'appropriation'
may be used in two senses. It may either mean simply the identification of the goods by agreement
of parties as the goods to which the contract of sale relates or it may mean the passing of property in
the goods from the seller to the buyer by such means as delivery to the carrier, etc. The scheme of
the CST Act shows that the element of passing of property is not of relevance in determining the
situs of sale. The question of appropriation of goods has to be decided, therefore, irrespective of
passing of property. In other words, appropriation referred to in section 4(2)(b) connotes the setting
apart of goods as specified goods to be delivered under the contract of sale and not an appropriation
linked with the passing of property. Reliance was placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in
the case of Indian Tourist Development Corporation Limited v. Assistant Commissioner of
Commercial Taxes, (2012) 3 SCC 204, wherein the court in the context of the provisions of Article
286 of the Constitution had held that the State of Karnataka had no right to tax the sale or purchase
of goods which takes place at the duty free shops which are not within the customs frontiers of
India. The decision of the Karnataka High Court in the case of State of Karnataka v. West Coast
Paper Mills, 1985 ILR Karnataka 3857, was relied upon and more particularly paragraphs 13 and 14
thereof. It was submitted that in the light of the principles laid down in the above decisions, the
State of Gujarat is not competent to levy sales tax on the sale of Natural Gas to GAIL.
9.5 Alternatively, Mr. Chidambaram submitted that the sales in the present case are sales of goods
in the course of import into the territory of India. Article 1(3) of the Constitution defines the
territory of India. The gas wells and the Offshore Platform are located at places outside the territory
of India. Article 297(3) of the Constitution enables Parliament to specify the limits of the territorial
waters, the continental shelf, the exclusive economic zone and other maritime zones. Parliament has
made the Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic Zone and Other Maritime
Zones Act, 1976 (Maritime Zones Act). Section 3 thereof declares that the sovereignty of India
extends and has always extended to the territorial waters of India. Section 5 defines 'Contiguous
Zone'. Section 6 defines 'Continental Shelf' and section 7 defines 'the Exclusive Economic Zone'.
Under section 5(5), section 6(6) and section 7(7) of the Maritime Zones Act, the Central
Government, by notification, may extend any enactment for the time being in force in India to the
Contiguous Zone or Continental Shelf or Exclusive Economic Zone respectively. When so extended,
the enactment concerned shall have effect as if the area to which the enactment was extended is a
part of the territory of India. Reference was made to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of
Aban Lloyd Chiles Offshore Ltd. v. Union of India, 2008 (227) ELT 24 (SC), wherein it has, inter
alia, been held thus:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 12B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
"Sovereignty of India extends over the territorial waters but the position is different
in the case of continental shelf and exclusive economic zone of India.... Thus,
subsection (6) of section 6 and subsection (7) of Section 7 create a fiction by which
the continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone deemed to be a part of India
for the purpose of such enactments which are extended to those areas by the Central
Government by issuing a notification." [Emphasis supplied] It was submitted that the
gas wells where the gas originated, the Offshore Platform where the water and oil
were separated from the gas and the delivery point are all beyond the territorial
waters of India. Neither the CST Act nor the GST Act has been extended by
notification to any area beyond the territorial waters of India. Hence, as far as these
two Acts are concerned, the gas wells, the Offshore Platform and the delivery point
are not within the territory of India. Since the CST Act and the GST Act have not been
extended to and do not have force in those places, insofar as these two Acts are
concerned, they are places outside India.
9.6 The learned counsel further submitted that under the PSC, which is the sole contract between
the parties, gas produced outside India and delivered at the delivery point outside India is
eventually brought through a pipeline to the mainland (Hazira), in other words, the gas is imported
into the territory of India. The sale of gas has, therefore, occasioned such import. Alternatively, by
applying the principles contained in section 4(2) of the CST Act, the title to the gas has been
transferred at or before the delivery point, well before the Gas via the pipeline, entered the territorial
waters of India. Looked at in any way, section 5(2) of the CST Act is squarely attracted and hence,
the sale of gas under the PSC "shall be deemed to take place in the course of the import of the goods
into the territory of India" within the meaning of section 5(2) of the CST Act. According to the
learned counsel, since the phrase "territory of India" is not defined in the CST Act, the meaning
must be consistent with the Constitution of India and hence, the meaning of the phrase will be the
same as in Article 1(3) of the Constitution. Since the CST Act has not been extended to any area
beyond the territorial waters, there is no question of a deemed territory of India for the purpose of
the CST Act. Consequently, the State of Gujarat would not have jurisdiction to levy sales tax on the
transaction which is a sale in the course of import into the territory of India. It was submitted that
the gas wells, Offshore Platform and delivery point are located outside the territory of India. Any
movement of goods from a place outside the territory of India (Gas Wells, Offshore Platform and
delivery point) to a place within the territory of India (Hazira) will indeed be a movement in the
course of import of the goods into the territory of India. Any sale which occasions such import
would fall under section 5(2) of the CST Act and, therefore, be outside the purview of the GST Act.
In support of his submission, the learned counsel placed reliance upon the decisions of the Supreme
Court in M/s. K.G. Khosla v. Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, AIR 1966 SC 1216, Indian
Tourist Development Corporation (supra), State of Maharashtra v. Embee Corporation, Bombay,
(1997) 7 SCC 190 and more particularly paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 thereof, Indure Ltd. v. Commercial
Tax Officer, (2010) 9 SCC 461, as well as State of Travancore, Cochin v. Bombay Company Ltd., AIR
1952 SCC 366.
9.7 Mr. Chidambaram next submitted that the contract was for the sale and purchase of all the
Natural Gas discovered and produced in the contract area as defined in the PSC. Under Article 21.1
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 13B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
of the PSC, the Indian domestic market shall have the first call on the Natural Gas produced under
the PSC. Reference was made to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Reliance Ltd. v.
Reliance, (2010) 7 SCC 1, wherein the court had held that a 'domestic market' means the entire class
of eligible buyers in India. Under Article 21.3, for the purpose of sale to the domestic market, the
delivery point shall be the delivery point set forth in the Gas Sales Contract entered into by the
Contractor. It was submitted that if the Government does not opt to take all the gas or if the
Government directs the Contractor to sell the gas to more than one nominee, the Contractor may
enter into several Gas Sales Contracts and in each Gas Sales Contract there could be a different
delivery point. This would be consistent with Article 1.27 which contemplates different delivery
points for the purposes of sales to the Government, export or domestic sales. It was submitted that
in the present case, Government opted to take all the gas and directed the Contractor to deliver it to
a pipeline at the delivery point. Long after the PSC was entered into, the Government nominated
GAIL to receive the gas at Hazira. Reference was made to Article 1.54 of the PSC which defines
'Natural Gas' to mean wet gas, dry gas, all other gaseous hydrocarbons, all substances contained
therein including sulphur and helium which are produced from oil or gas wells. It was submitted
that Natural Gas, ANG and NANG and Excess ANG are synonyms. The contract is for the sale of
100% of the Deliverability of ANG and NANG which is nothing but 100% of the Deliverability of
Natural Gas. It is, these goods (Natural Gas) which are delivered at the delivery point and the title
passes to the Government or its nominee at the delivery point and all costs and risks after the
delivery point become the responsibility of the Government or its nominee. It was pointed out that
the impugned assessment orders have assessed the goods as Natural Gas. The rate of sales tax is
levied under Item (7) of part B of Schedule II to the GST Act which is "Natural and Associated Gas"
and hence, the respondent State cannot now contend that the goods are anything other than Natural
Gas.
9.8 As regards the validity of the reopening of assessment, it was submitted that the show-cause
notices are under section 44 of the GST Act to reopen the assessment and the consequent
reassessment orders are without jurisdiction and are void ab initio. Referring to the record of the
case, it was pointed out that in respect of five years, viz., 1997-98 to 2001-02, the original
assessment was a nil assessment so far as Panna-Mukta Gas was concerned. Notice of reassessment
in respect of each of these five years was issued on 20 th October, 2003 and the petitioner filed its
reply thereto on 12th December, 2003. The reassessment orders were passed for one year on 9th
January, 2004 and for the other four years on 20th January, 2004. It was pointed out that on 3rd
September, 1999, the petitioner had written to the Additional Commissioner of Sales Tax enclosing a
copy of the PSC and relying upon several articles thereof. On 7th January, 2002, the Additional
Commissioner, Sales Tax issued a show-cause notice for the year 2001-02 in which he referred to
the above letter dated 3rd September, 1999 and dealt with various aspects of the PSC according to
his interpretation. On 28th January, 2002, the petitioner submitted a reply relying on various
clauses of the PSC wherein the petitioner specifically made reference to the ISPA. On 4th March,
2002, the petitioner filed a supplementary reply clarifying some of the issues such as delivery point
and also explaining the difference between sour gas and sweet gas and maintained that sour gas and
sweet gas continue to remain the same commercial commodity. It was pointed out that, therefore,
the Assessing Officer had before him, the PSC and the ISPA as well as detailed submissions made by
the petitioner on various clauses of the PSC. After considering all the above material, the Assessing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 14B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
Officer passed a nil assessment order (insofar as Panna-Mukta Gas was concerned) for the year
2001-02 on 30th June, 2003 and on the same day, passed a nil assessment order for the year
2000-01. It was submitted that having regard to the fact that nil assessment orders were passed on
30th June, 2003, there was no reason to believe that any turnover of Panna- Mukta Gas had escaped
assessment so as to invoke section 44 of the GST Act on 20th October, 2003. It was submitted that
between 30th June, 2003 and 20th October, 2003, the Assessing Officer had no new material before
him nor had he discovered any new fact that was unknown to him earlier. The show-cause notice
simply refers to the PSC and, without any disclosure of the "reason to believe" that turnover had
escaped assessment, holds that the petitioner was liable to pay sales tax on sale of Panna-Mukta gas.
Therefore, this is a case of mere change of opinion between 30th June, 2003 and 20th October,
2003, which is impermissible under law. In support of his submission, the learned counsel placed
reliance upon the decisions of the Supreme Court in Calcutta Discount v. ITO, AIR (1961) 41 ITR
191, Ganga Saran v. ITO, 1981 (3) SCC 143, CIT v. Kelvinator, (2010) 320 ITR 561, Phoolchand
Bajranglal v. ITO, (1993) 4 SCC 77, State of Maharahstra v. Ketan Enterprises,
2010-(ST1)-GJX-0125-Bom, an unreported decision of this court in the case of Krishak Bharati Co-
operative Limited v. State of Gujarat rendered in Special Civil Application No.3708/2012 as well as
the decision in the case of Niko Resources v. Assistant Director of Income Tax,
2014-TIOL-1679-HC-AHM-IT. Referring to the impugned order, it was submitted that the
reassessment orders proceed on the basis that since sweetened gas is delivered at Hazira, the State is
competent to levy sales tax. It was submitted that for the reasons already submitted, the basis of the
reassessment is erroneous and perverse. Moreover, it is merely a change of opinion and hence, does
not furnish any ground to reopen the nil assessment insofar as Panna-Mukta Gas is concerned.
9.9 Next, it was submitted that assuming that the petitioner is liable to pay sales tax under the GST
Act for the period from 1997-98 to 2004-05, under the PSC, it is the Government of India or its
nominee who has to pay sales tax, if any such tax is due. Referring to the pleadings of the parties, it
was pointed out that the petitioner in its reply dated 28 th January, 2002 to the show-cause notice
and in its pleadings has consistently stated that the tax on goods (Natural Gas) purchased from the
petitioner, if any, has to be paid by GAIL. GAIL in its affidavit-in-reply to Special Civil Application
No.2084/2004 has not denied the petitioner's averment that tax on sale of goods is payable by
GAIL. Reference was made to Article 21.5.15 of the PSC to submit that it is clearly stipulated therein
that the Government and/or its nominee shall pay all sales tax payable on the sale of gas to the
Government or its nominee. Reference was made to the provisions of ISPA to point out that in
clause 4 thereof it is stated that "the buyer shall pay any and all sales tax payable on the sale of gas,
in addition to the price of gas". It was argued that the petitioner is disputing the demand of sales tax
as according to the petitioner, it is not liable and no sales tax is payable. It is only if the petitioner is
held to be liable to pay sales tax, the liability would be crystallized and the tax would be payable. It is
at that point of time alone that the petitioner can demand that the Government of India or its
nominee should bear the burden of the tax and reimburse the petitioner. It was urged that since all
the parties including the Government of India, GAIL and the State Government are before this
court, in the event of the petitioner being held liable to pay sales tax for the period in question, in
order to do complete justice between the parties and to avoid protracted litigation, it would be just
for the court to direct that the sales tax liability cast on the petitioner should be reimbursed by the
Government of India or its nominee, GAIL. It was further submitted that if the petitioner is liable to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 15B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
pay sales tax for the years in question, it would be just for this court to issue appropriate directions
to GAIL to issue Form 17 and 17B as required under sections 12 and 13 of the GST Act. Lastly, it was
submitted that even assuming that sales tax is payable, the imposition of penalty and interest is
wholly unjustified. It was submitted that under section 45(2)(c) of the GST Act, penalty is levied
only if there is 'concealment' or 'deliberately furnishing inaccurate particulars'. In the present case,
there was neither concealment nor deliberate furnishing of inaccurate particulars. This is a case
where the issue is a constitutional and legal issue namely, whether the sale is a local sale within the
State of Gujarat or not and hence, in such a case, section 45(2)(c) of the GST Act is not attracted and
no penalty can be levied thereunder. It was submitted that under section 45(6) of the GST Act,
penalty is leviable if the reassessed amount of tax exceeds the original amount of tax by 25%. In the
present case, the original assessment was made only in respect of Tapti gas. If sales tax is leviable on
Panna-Mukta Gas also, the reassessed amount will naturally exceed the original assessed amount. If
the difference exceeds 25%, the assessee is, under section 45(5), deemed to have failed to pay tax.
Based on such a deeming provision, another penalty is leviable under section 45(6) of the GST Act.
It was urged that in the present case, the failure to pay the tax on the Panna-Mukta gas is solely
because of the dispute whether the sale of Panna-Mukta Gas is a local sale within the State of
Gujarat. Since the question is purely a constitutional and legal issue, there is no justification to deem
a failure to pay tax and levy penalty on the basis of such deemed failure. It was, accordingly, urged
that the petitions deserve to be allowed in terms of the reliefs claimed therein.
10. Adopting the submissions made by Mr. P. Chidambaram, Mr. S.N. Soparkar, Senior Advocate,
learned counsel for Reliance Industries Limited, the petitioner in Special Civil Application
No.3119/2004 and connected matters submitted that the only question that arises in this batch of
petitions is as to whether the sale has taken place within the State of Gujarat. In addition to the
submissions advanced by Mr. Chidambaram, Mr. Soparkar submitted that section 5(2) of the CST
Act provides that a sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed to take place in the course of the
import of goods into the territory of India in two independent situations: (i) if the sale or purchase
occasions such import; or (ii) if the sale or purchase is effected by a transfer of documents of title to
the goods, before the goods have crossed the customs frontier of India. According to the learned
counsel, the instant case falls in situation (i) as undisputedly, in the instant case sale is not effected
by transfer of documents. The words 'customs frontier of India' and section 2(ab) of the CST Act,
1956 are, therefore, irrelevant for the present purpose. Alternatively and without prejudice to the
other submissions, it was submitted that since the sale in the instant case has occasioned the import,
viz., bringing of goods into India from a place outside India, section 5(2) of the CST Act would apply
even if it is held that sale took place at Hazira, within the State of Gujarat. It was submitted that the
State where the title has passed is irrelevant; the only relevant consideration being that the sale
must have occasioned movement of goods from one State to another (from outside India into India).
The GST Act, under the circumstances, would not apply to such a sale. In support of his submission,
the learned counsel placed reliance upon the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of
Manganese Ore (India) Limited v. Regional Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax, Jabalpur, AIR
1976 SC 410, as well as the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Balabhagas Hulaschand v.
State of Orissa, (1976) 2 SCC 44.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 16B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
10.1 It was submitted in the case of Reliance Industries Limited, all the assessments are provisional
and in case of ONGC barring one, all are provisional assessments and that this is not a fit case where
provisional assessments can be made. It was argued that the impugned assessment orders are
passed without jurisdiction and are void ab initio, inasmuch, as an order can be passed under
section 41(b) of the GST Act where the Commissioner has reason to believe that the dealer has
evaded tax. In the instant case, at no point of time, the Assessing Officer had any reason to believe
that the dealer had evaded tax and that there did not exist any facts, circumstances or grounds, for
the Assessing Officer to invoke the power of making provisional assessment under section 41(b) of
the Act. It was contended that apart from the fact that there is no evasion of tax, the impugned order
is not passed on the premise that the dealer has evaded the tax. Reliance was placed upon the
decision of this court in the case of Batliboy v. Sales Tax Officer, 2000 (111 or 119) STC 583, wherein
the court has held that under section 41B of the GST Act, provisional assessment can be made by the
Commissioner or his delegate as assessing authority only if "he has reason to believe that a dealer
has evaded tax". In the facts of the said case, neither in the show cause notice issued prior to making
the provisional assessment nor in the assessment orders, had the assessing authority recorded
reasons or grounds for coming to the conclusion that the dealer had evaded tax. The court held that
the expression "evasion of tax" conveys mens rea on the part of the dealer and found that the said
case was not a case whereby the Assessing Officer could have resorted to the provisions under
section 41B of the GST Act for provisional assessment of the petitioner therein and imposition of
tax, penalty and interest. It was further submitted that if GAIL says that it is liable to pay sales tax,
then it has to reimburse the petitioner in respect of any sales tax liability that may be incurred by it.
That Form 17 etc. should be furnished by GAIL and that if it does not give such forms, the
petitioners will have to pay additional tax and GAIL will be liable to reimburse the same. In
conclusion, it was submitted that the sale in the present case is outside the State of Gujarat and
hence, the State of Gujarat has no jurisdiction to levy sales tax thereon. Alternatively, the sale is in
the course of import. The State of Gujarat, therefore, has no legislative competence to levy tax on the
transaction in question. The only basis for levying sales tax is that there is a process of sweetening.
Sweetening is not a process as gas remains gas. The transaction is complete outside the State of
Gujarat and hence, not amenable to the provisions of the GST Act. Reliance was placed upon various
decisions for contending that the process of sweetening of Natural Gas does not amount to
manufacture. However, for the reasons that follow, it is not necessary to refer to the same in detail.
11. Opposing the petitions, Mr. S.N. Shelat, Senior Advocate, learned counsel for first respondent -
State of Gujarat, submitted that the sale in question has taken place within the State of Gujarat and
hence, the provisions of the GST Act would be applicable to the sale of Natural Gas by the
petitioners to GAIL. It was submitted that on behalf of the petitioners two-fold submissions have
been made. Firstly, that the sale of goods has not taken place within the State of Gujarat and
secondly, that the sale has taken place in the course of import into the territory of India. Dealing
with the second limb of submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioners, it was
contended that the sales in question have not taken place in the course of import into the territory of
India. The attention of the court was invited to the provisions of sub-section (2) of section 5 of the
CST Act to submit that the word 'import' is not defined under the said Act. 'Customs frontier' is not
defined under the CST Act and, therefore, section 2(22) of the Customs Act has to be imported into
section 5(2) of the CST Act. It was submitted that section 5(2) of the CST Act is not applicable
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 17B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
because the sale does not occasion import from a foreign destination. According to the learned
counsel, in view of the provisions of the Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic
Zone and Other Maritime Zones Act, 1956 and notification issued thereunder, the customs frontier
is extended. The provisions of the Customs Act are imported into the provisions of the CST Act for
determining whether the sale is in the course of import. It was submitted that the movement of
goods from the Continental Shelf or Exclusive Economic Zone to Hazira onshore being within the
customs frontier, is not import into the territory of India and the sales in question are, therefore,
chargeable to sales tax under the GST Act. Reliance was placed upon the decision of the Supreme
Court in the case of Aban Lloyd Chiles Offshore Ltd. v. Union of India (supra) to submit that the
point is concluded against the petitioner in paragraph 77 of the said decision. Reference was also
made to the decision of this court in Larsen and Toubro Ltd. v. Union of India, 2012 (1) GLH 55, and
more particularly paragraphs 39, 40, 41 and 42, wherein the above decision of the Supreme Court
has been extensively quoted. It was submitted that the Gujarat judgment proceeds on the basis that
the sale has been effected at Bombay High and not at Hazira. The question, therefore, of
applicability of the CST Act was considered and not the question as to whether there was an import
within the State of Gujarat or not. It was pointed out that in Commissioner of Sales Tax,
Maharashtra State, Mumbai v. Pure Helium (India) Ltd., (2012) 49 VST 14 (Bom.), the Bombay
High Court has considered the judgment of the Gujarat High Court and accepted the said ratio and
thereafter examined as to whether any export has occasioned to Mumbai High. It was pointed out
that the court has held that the scheme of the Customs Act, 1962 has to be read together with other
Acts such as Maritime Zones Act, 1976 which are in pari materia. 'Export' for the purposes of section
5(1) of the CST Act cannot have a meaning which is divorced from the applicability of the Customs
Act, 1962 to a territory in pursuance of a notification issued in exercise of the powers conferred upon
the Union Government under the Maritime Zones Act. It was submitted that in view of the above,
the provisions of section 5(2) of the CST Act are not attracted and there is no import to onshore
Hazira by the contractor. It was submitted that the fact that the transaction in question is not an
inter-State trade has been conceded by the petitioners. It was submitted that in Murli Manohar v.
State of Maharashtra, (1991) 1 SCC 377, the Supreme Court has held that the sale effected by the
assessee must fall within three categories: (1) local sale (2) Inter-State sale and (3) sale in the course
of import. It was submitted that since the sale in question is neither in the course of import nor is an
inter-State sale, it would fall within the category of local sale as any sale has to fall within any one of
the above three categories.
11.1 Mr. Shelat next submitted that it is the case of the Contractor that the sale is of
specific/ascertained goods; however, such contention is not borne out from the Production Sharing
Contract which is for future goods, that is, unascertained goods. It was submitted that when the
Contractor entered into the production sharing contract, they were not aware while undertaking
petroleum operations in the contract area, as to what quantity/quality of natural gas could be
received. Moreover, the contracting parties are not ad idem about the delivery point for the
appropriation to the contract of sale. The attention of the court was invited to the provisions of
section 4 of the CST Act to submit that clause (b) of sub- section (2) thereof provides that in case of
unascertained or future goods, a sale of goods is deemed to be inside a State if the goods are within
the State at the time of their appropriation to the contract of sale by the seller or by the buyer,
whether assent of the other party is prior or subsequent to such appropriation. It was pointed out
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 18B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
that according to the Union of India and GAIL, appropriation takes place at Hazira downstream of
the separation and sweetening facility owned and operated by ONGC when the sweetened gas is
received by the buyer (delivery to the buyer) whereas the constituents of the contractor contend that
the delivery point is offshore at upstream-weld. Therefore, the Contractor, the Union of India and its
nominee GAIL are not ad idem as to the delivery point where appropriation is effected. It was
submitted that the Union of India and GAIL have exchanged correspondence with the constituents
of the Contractor which reflect that the Union of India which is a party to the Production Sharing
Contract, interprets the contract to mean that the delivery point is at onshore Hazira for the purpose
of appropriation. It was submitted that the constituents of the Contractor rely on Article
21.5.13(a)(iv) read with Articles 21.5.13(c) and 27.2 to hold that appropriation is effected offshore;
however, the above clauses in Article 21.5.13 cannot be read in compartment and in isolation. The
terms of the agreement have to be read as a whole to find out the delivery point where the goods are
appropriated. It was submitted that Articles 21.3, 21.5.13(iii), 21.5.13(c) and 21.5.13(e) are to be read
with contents of the Panna-Mukta Sales and Purchase Agreement. The agreement has to be read so
as not to render the above clauses otiose or redundant. According to the learned counsel, one of the
essential considerations is that the assent of the other party (GAIL) is to be obtained prior or
subsequent to such appropriation, whereas, the buyer, viz., the nominee of Government of India -
GAIL has never given its assent for the appropriation to the contract as is being contended by the
Contractor.
11.2 As regards the contention of the Contractor that assent is given in the agreement under Article
27.2, the learned counsel submitted that this contention is wholly erroneous in view of the fact that:
(a) in view of section 4(2)(b), the article dealing with passing of title, that is, Article 27.2 is not
decisive, and (b) Article 27.2 refers to delivery point. It was submitted that Article 27.2 refers to the
delivery point offshore which contention negates the contents of Article 21.5.13(e) where it is
categorically asserted that GAIL, nominee of Union of India will receive gas at Hazira downstream
of the separation and sweetening facility owned and operated by ONGC. It was submitted that,
therefore, no assent is given for appropriation by the Union of India or its nominee. The delivery
point, according to the Union of India and its nominee is onshore Hazira in view of Articles
21.5.13(iii), 21.5.13(c) and 21.5.13(e). Therefore, in view of the provisions of clause (b) of sub-section
(2) of section 4 of the CST Act, the sale of goods in the instant case is deemed to have taken place
inside the State of Gujarat.
11.3 It was submitted that when Article 21.3 of the PSC refers to the domestic market, the
Government of India has contemplated domestic market to serve through its nominee GAIL and
GAIL has to comply with the directions of the Union of India. Article 21.3, therefore, has to be read
conjointly with other clauses. According to the learned counsel, reliance placed by the petitioners
upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Reliance Natural Resources v. Reliance Industries
(supra) is not justified because in the facts of the said case under the Production Sharing Contract
with the Union of India, 'the contractor was free to sell the gas produced from the block subject to
the adjustment and terms of profit sharing between the Government and it, as set out in the
Production Sharing Contract'. It was submitted that it is in this context that the Apex Court had held
that natural resources belonged to the people of India and Union of India was holding the same in
trust and, therefore, reference to domestic market was given a meaning which cannot be given in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 19B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
present contract where gas is not to be sold in the market to contractors but to the Government
nominee.
11.4 According to the learned counsel, the normal understanding of the term 'appropriation' would
require the following elements:-
(i) goods should conform to the description as per the agreement;
(ii) goods must be in a deliverable state; and
(ii) there has to be acceptance by the other party, even subsequent to the
appropriation by the seller, in the absence of such assent, appropriation is not
effected.
11.5 It was submitted that, therefore, the following factors become relevant for consideration:
(i) The goods at the offshore are neither ascertained nor ascertainable nor are they in
deliverable state as they are co- mingled with other gases.
(ii) The gas is transmitted to the ONGC Underwater Gas Transmission Line which
transports gas from Bassein to Hazira onshore.
(iii) It is only ascertained after the condensed gas is separated and sweetened at
Hazira onshore and it is at this stage that there is an appropriation by the buyer.
Unilateral appropriation by the seller at the upstream-weld would not render valid
the appropriation unless subsequent assent is given by the buyer.
It was urged that the above interpretation is further fortified because the transportation cost is
borne by the Contractor and the risk is also borne by the Contractor till delivery is effected at Hazira
onshore. The buyer is at Hazira onshore. Sweetened gas is received by the buyer at the delivery point
onshore Hazira. Even the liability of the payment of sales tax has been determined as both the
parties understood that sales tax is payable under the contract when the gas is sold at Hazira to
GAIL. It is GAIL which bears the liability to pay tax, though under the Sales Tax Act, it is the seller
who has to pay the tax to the State of Gujarat. Reference was made to Halsbury's Laws of England,
Fourth Edition 2005 Reissue Volume 41 paragraph 109, wherein it has been stated that "Like all
contracts, a contract of sale must be construed as a whole. Accordingly, the property in the goods
passes where the terms of the contract show a clear intention that it will pass notwithstanding that
there may be an express provision in the contract to the contrary." Reference was also made to
Halsbury's Laws of England Volume 13 paragraph 174, wherein it has been stated that "It is a rule of
construction applicable to all written instruments that the instrument must be constructed as a
whole in order to ascertain the true meaning of several clauses. The best construction of deeds is to
make one part of the deed expound the other so as to make all other parts agree. Effect must, as far
as possible, be given to every word and every clause. It has been said that the court in a case of
patent satisfaction (though the dictum may have a more general application) must adopt a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 20B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
purposive construction rather than a purely literal one derived from applying to it the kind of
meticulous verbal analysis in which lawyers are so often tempted by their training to indulge. The
fact that a particular construction leads to a very unreasonable result is a relevant consideration."
11.6 In support of his submissions, the learned counsel placed reliance upon the decision of the
Supreme Court in the case of S. Chhattanatha Karayalar v. The Central Bank of India, AIR 1965 SC
1856, for the proposition that if the transaction is contained in more than one document between
the same parties, they must be read together. Reliance was placed upon the decision of the Supreme
Court in the case of Her Highness Maharani Shantadevi P. Gaekwad v. Savjibhai Haribhai Patel,
2001 (3) GLR 2097, and more particularly, paragraph 56 thereof.
11.7 The next submission advanced by Mr. Shelat was that Article 21.3 of the Production Sharing
Contract refers to Gas Sale Contract between the contractor and GAIL. The contracts are separate,
one by the Contractor and Union of India and another by the Contractor and GAIL, but the Union of
India has nominated GAIL for serving the domestic market. The subsequent price agreement is
complimentary to the Production Sharing Contract and has to be projected while construing the
appropriation of goods by GAIL at onshore Hazira. It was submitted that is well-settled that if one
document refers to another, it has to be read as a part of the contract. In support of such
submission, the learned counsel placed reliance upon paragraph 46 of the Commentaries on Law of
Contract P.C. Markanda Volume I section 1-72. It was submitted that though the word 'receive' has
been used in Article 21.5.13(e), the word 'receive' and 'delivery' are synonyms. Reference was also
made to meaning of the word 'deliver' in the Great Dictionary English Language as well as the
Chambers Dictionary.
11.8 Reliance was also placed upon the decision of the Karnataka High Court in the case of State of
Karnataka v. West Coast Paper Mills Ltd, AIR 1986 Karnataka 103, wherein it has been held thus:-
"Section 18 of the Sale of Goods Act provides that where there is a contract for sale of
unascertained goods, no property in goods is transferred to the buyer unless and until
the goods are ascertained. That would be so even where price of goods is agreed and
paid in advance, because neither seller nor the buyer could say which of such
unascertained goods is sold or purchased."
11.9 Reference was made to the decision of the Allahabad High Court in the case of Pyare Lal -
Kishan Prasad v. Diwan Singh - Ganesh Lal, AIR 1930 Allahabad 661, wherein it has been held
thus:-
"There is a distinction between a case where something remains to be done by the
vendor to the goods for the purpose of putting them into a state in which the vendee
is to take them and a case where the vendee for his own satisfaction wants to get the
goods weighed for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of the price. This
distinction has been recognized in a number of cases and appears to be well founded:
Annan v. Dubar Sheikh A.I.R. 1923 Oudh 15 (at p. 41 of 26 O.C.) and Abdul Aziz v.
Jogendra Krishna Roy [1917] 44 Cal. 98 (at p. 115). Two rules of civil law appear to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 21B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
have been incorporated both in the Sale of Goods Act and in the Indian Statute with
which we are concerned. These rules have been stated by Blackburn, J, to be as
follows (Contract of Sale, third edition, 1910, P. 184):
They are two fold: the first is that where, by the agreement, the seller is to do
anything to the goods for the purpose of putting them into that state in which the
buyer is to be bound to accept them, or, as it is sometimes worded, into a deliverable
state, the performance of those things shall (in the absence of circumstances
indicating a contrary intention) be taken to be a condition precedent to the vesting of
the property.
The second is, that where anything remains to be done to the goods for the purpose of
ascertaining the price, as by weighing, measuring, or testing the goods where the
price is to depend on the quantity or quality of the goods; the performance of these
things, also shall be a condition precedent to the transfer of the property, although
the individual goods be ascertained, and they are in the state in which they ought to
be accepted."
11.10 The decision of the Nagpur High Court in the case of Harnarain Ramchandra Jaiswal v. Firm
Radhakisan Narayandas, AIR (36) 1949 Nagpur 178, was cited for the proposition that the phrase
'ascertained goods' has not been defined and to understand it, it is helpful to think in terms of
'unascertained goods'. If one sells twenty chairs of the same kind and offers to sell ten, the goods are
unascertained till ten particular chairs are appropriated towards the contract. On appropriation, the
goods become ascertained. If the identity of the contract goods is not established by appropriating it
towards the contract, the contract remains in respect of unascertained goods. Reliance was placed
upon the decision of the Privy Council in the case of Re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd (In receivership),
(1994) 2 All ER 806, wherein it has been held thus:-
"Approaching these situations a priori common sense dictates that the buyer cannot
acquire title until it is known to what goods the title relates. Whether the property
then passes will depend upon the intention of the parties and in particular on
whether there has been a consensual appropriation of particular goods to the
contract."
11.11 Reliance was placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Jute and Gunny
Brokers Ltd. v. Union of India & Ors., AIR 1961 SC 1214 and more particularly, paragraphs 13 and 14
thereof. Reliance was placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of P. S. N. S.
Ambalavana Chettiar and Co. Ltd. v. Indian Express Newspapers Ltd. Bombay, AIR 1968 SC 741, for
the proposition that section 18 of the Sale of Goods Act provides that where there is a contract for
the sale of unascertained goods no property in the goods is transferred to the buyer unless and until
the goods are ascertained. It is a condition precedent to the passing of property under a contract of
sale that the goods are ascertained. The condition is not fulfilled where there is a contract for sale of
a portion of a specified larger stock. Till the portion is identified and appropriated to the contract,
no property passes to the buyer. Mr. Shelat submitted that appropriation is essentially a question of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 22B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
fact when parties are not ad idem and when the buyer contends that it is not appropriated on the
delivery point as understood by the Contractor, this court is required to consider the totality of the
circumstances under which the Production Sharing Contract has been executed and implemented.
11.12 On the question as to whether the sweetening of gas is a process leading to new marketable
gas, the learned counsel submitted that what has been agreed upon by the Production Sharing
Agreement is delivery of sweetened gas onshore at Hazira. It was submitted that the petitioners have
contended that under the Production Sharing Contract, the sale is of natural gas delivered at the
upstream weld, but such gas delivered at the upstream weld is not the same as agreed by the Union
of India and GAIL. The sour gas becomes a product which is marketable only after it is sweetened by
processing and it is this marketable product that the buyer had agreed to purchase. Therefore, the
sweetening of the Natural Gas results in making the sour gas a marketable product. In support of his
submission, the learned counsel placed reliance upon the decision of the Supreme Court in the case
of Association of Natural Gas and Others v. Union of India and Others, AIR 2004 SC 2647, wherein
it has been observed that to obtain a marketable product, the raw material gas flowing from gas or
oil wells must be processed to remove water vapour, inert or poisonous constituents and
condensable hydrocarbons. The processed gas is principally methane, with small amounts of ethane,
propane, butane, pentane, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. This gas can easily be transported from the
producing areas to the market in underground pipelines under pressure or liquefied at low
temperatures and transported in specially designed ocean-going tankers. The composition of natural
gas at the wellhead varies from field to field. Many undesirable components may be present that
must be removed by processing before delivery to the pipeline. It was submitted that, therefore, the
sour and unsweetened gas can only be marketable after undergoing the sweetening process. No
further authenticated statement is required in this regard.
11.13 Reliance was also placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Sonebhadra
Fuels v. Commissioner, Trade Tax, U.P. Lucknow, (2006) 7 SCC 322, wherein the court had
extracted the definition of 'manufacture' as under:-
"2.(e-i) "manufacture" means producing, making, mining, collecting, extracting,
altering, ornamenting, finishing or otherwise processing, treating or adapting any
goods; but does not include such manufacturers or manufacturing processes as may
be prescribed:"
It was submitted that the above definition of 'manufacture' is similar to the definition of
'manufacture' in section 2(16) of the GST Act which reads as under:
"manufacture: with all its grammatical variations and cognate expressions, means
producing, making, extracting, collecting, altering, ornamenting, finishing or
otherwise processing, treating or adapting any goods; but does not include such
manufacturers or manufacturing processes as may be prescribed.:"
It was submitted that the court in the said case has held that the definition of 'manufacture' in
section 2(e)(i) of the U.P. Trade Tax Act is very wide which includes processing, treating or adapting
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 23B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
any goods. The court was of the opinion that the expression 'manufacture' covers within its sweep
not only such activities which bring into existence a new commercial commodity different from the
articles on which that activity was carried on, but also such activities which do not necessarily result
in bringing into existence an article different from the articles on which such activity was carried on.
The decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax v. M/s. Oracle
Software India Ltd. JT 2010 (6) SC 369 was cited wherein the court held as under:-
"The term "manufacture" implies a change, but, every change is not a manufacture,
despite the fact that every change in an article is the result of a treatment of labour
and manipulation. However, this test of manufacture needs to be seen in the context
of the above process. If an operation/process renders a commodity or article fit for
use for which it is otherwise not fit, the operation/process falls within the meaning of
the word 'manufacture."
After examining various decisions, the court in paragraph 22 of the decision held as under:-
"22. We may mention that, as noted above, decisions construing the word
"manufacture" in other statutes are not necessarily applicable when interpreting
Section 2(e-1) of the U.P. Trade Tax Act. As stated above, the definition of
"manufacture" in Section 2(e-1) of the U.P. Trade Tax Act is very wide, which
includes processing, treating or adapting any goods. However, in our opinion, the
expression "manufacture" covers within its sweep not only such activities which bring
into existence a new commercial commodity different from the articles on which that
activity was carried on, but also such activities which do not necessarily result in
bringing into existence an article different from the articles on which such activity
was carried on."
11.14 Mr. Shelat submitted that the principles laid down by the Apex Court have to be applied to the
facts of the present case. The apex court has held that if an operation/process renders a commodity
or article fit for use for which it was otherwise not fit, the operation/process falls within the meaning
of the word 'manufacture'. It was pointed out that the Apex Court has approved of the decision in
United States v. International Paint Company, 35 C.C.P.A. 87, C.A.D. 76. It was, accordingly,
submitted that in view of the above referred decision of the Supreme Court, the precedents cited on
behalf of the petitioners that a new product does not emerge after the sweetening process and that
there is no manufacturing activity by the sweetening process is erroneous and unjustified. Though
sweetened gas or unsweetened gas is known to the market as natural gas, unsweetened gas could not
be made marketable till the sweetening process is undertaken. That in the light of the above decision
of the Apex Court, there need not be a resultant new product but the article must be made fit for use.
11.15 As regards the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Reliance Natural Resources v.
Reliance Industries Ltd. (supra), on which reliance had been placed by the learned counsel for the
petitioners, it was submitted that the said decision is not relevant for interpreting the Production
Sharing Contract between the Government of India and the Contractor. It was submitted that in the
facts of the said case, the Production Sharing Agreement was of a different nature. In the present
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 24B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
Production Sharing Contract, there is a mechanism for determination of price rate with price share
agreement. In the Reliance case, the contractor was to sell gas to a third party with the approval of
the Government. In the facts of the present case, the buyer is already nominated by the Government
of India and the gas in the sweetened form is to be delivered as already indicated. Price is also fixed
and hence, such decision would be of no assistance to the petitioners.
12. Vehemently opposing the petitions, Mr. P.K. Jani, learned Additional Advocate General for the
respondent State authorities submitted that the question as to whether the goods are sold and
manufactured within the State of Gujarat has to be dealt with in the light of section 4(2)(b) of the
CST Act, viz., that the goods were within the State of Gujarat when the sale took place so as to attract
the GST Act and that the said goods were future unascertained goods. Reference was made to the
provisions of clause (b) of sub-section (2) of section 4 of the CST Act to submit that if the said
section is read with the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act, it would specify that the goods are sold
within the State of Gujarat on the same being ascertained by processing the gas so as to make it a
domestic and marketable commodity and accordingly, section 3 of the GST Act would come into
play and the contention raised by the petitioners that the sale is outside the State of Gujarat would
not hold good. It was submitted that the Production Sharing Contract is between the Government of
India and three petitioners. The PSC is executed on 22nd December, 1994 at which point of time the
Government of India had authorised the petitioners to carry out petroleum operations in the area
off-shore identified as Panna-Mukta fields. Therefore, the relevant clauses in the PSC insofar as the
same pertain to the delivery point for the goods are for future and unascertained goods. No goods, in
terms of gas, were in existence when the PSC was executed. According to the learned counsel, the
PSC is only a document especially in relation to authorizing the grant of mining lease to carry out
petroleum operations in off-shore area identified as Panna- Mukta fields and other subjects. Under
the PSC, the gas is to be received by GAIL at Hazira downstream of separation and sweetening
facilities owned and operated by ONGC. Under the Interim Sale and Purchase Agreement, the
petitioners were required to supply the gas of such nature and category which may be utilised by
consumers or buyer. The consumers of GAIL would require sweetened gas only. It was submitted
that the different definitions of 'delivery point' have to be read in a harmonious way and the delivery
point referred to in different clauses of the Articles of PSC are for different purposes. It was
emphatically argued that the PSC is not an agreement for sale of goods but is only a declaration of
intention of the parties to the agreement and the ISPA dated 1st June, 1998 is the agreement for sale
of goods between the Government of India's nominee GAIL and the petitioners. The ISPA is dated 1
st June, 1998 and is an agreement which is subsequent to the PSC which is dated 22nd December,
1994. The ISPA describes the agreement as a Sales and Purchase Agreement. Therefore, the sale has
to be considered in the context of ISPA dated 1st June, 1998.
12.1 It was submitted that under the Contract Act, the agreements are between the parties and are
required to be entered into with the consent of the parties on specific issues. Reference was made to
the affidavit-in-reply dated 15th April, 2004 filed on behalf of the Government of India who is a
signatory to the PSC, to point out that it has been stated therein that according to the Union of
India, insofar as interpretation of the PSCs and Interim Gas Sales and Purchase Contract is
concerned, its stand is that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, the delivery point is
on- shore at Hazira and the contention of the petitioners that the delivery point is off-shore at
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 25B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
Panna-Mukta oil fields has been denied. In view of the specific terms of the PSCs executed between
the petitioner No.1 - RIL and ONGC and the Union of India and the Interim Gas Sales and Purchase
Agreement executed between the petitioner No.1 - RIL and ONGC and GAIL - respondent No.7 as
also the fact that the gas produced at Panna-Mukta oil fields is incapable of being consumed till it is
subjected to a sweetening process on-shore at Hazira and the quantity of gas becomes ascertainable
on-shore at Hazira, the delivery point is on-shore at Hazira. The liability of sales tax, if any, has to be
determined on the above basis. It was submitted that when the Government of India, who is a
signatory to the PSC, has specifically stated that the sale has taken place on-shore, that is, at Hazira,
a unilateral assertion made by the petitioners that the sale has taken place on the High Seas cannot
be accepted. According to the learned counsel, there is no acceptance by the contracting party, viz.,
the Government of India that the sale of goods has taken place on the High Seas outside India and
hence, when the Union of India and GAIL, both dispute that the goods are sold off-shore, a
unilateral assertion by one party to the contract that the goods are sold off-shore cannot be
accepted. It was submitted that the petitioners have taken the responsibility of transporting the
goods from off-shore, that is, the T-Junction to the Hazira plant and there is no clause in the PSC
which puts this liability upon the petitioners to transport the goods for the buyer (GAIL, the
nominee of Government of India) from T- Junction to ONGC's Hazira plant at Surat. The petitioners
have been paying transportation charges to ONGC and the petitioners take the risk of the goods. The
petitioners also pay the conversion charges to ONGC's Hazira plant for converting sour gas into
sweetened gas. GAIL, the nominee of the Government of India accepts the delivery of gas/sweetened
gas only after ONGC sweetens the gas at its Hazira plant. Therefore, the goods are
appropriated/ascertained and identified by purchasers, that is, GAIL the nominee of Government of
India only after the sour gas is sweetened at Hazira plant of ONGC and that the goods at off-shore
T-Junction are unascertained future goods. It was also submitted that the goods of the petitioners
get co-mingled with Tapti gas at T- Junction and, therefore, remain unascertained and are not in a
deliverable state and, therefore, incapable of being appropriated at T-Junction i.e. off-shore. It was
contended that the Government of India's nominee GAIL has not appropriated the goods at T-
Junction i.e. off-shore and there is no implied or express act or consent by Government of India's
nominee GAIL to have appropriated the goods at off-shore. It was submitted that there is no facility
with the petitioners to sweeten the gas from sour gas off-shore and that the petitioners have not
shown or asserted that they have any facility off-shore to sweeten the gas. It was submitted that after
bringing the sour gas at Hazira, the petitioners have processed/manufactured the goods at Hazira.
By the said process of manufacture, a different and distinct product in the form of sweetened gas has
emerged which is liable to be taxed under the provisions of section 3 of the Gujarat Sales Tax read
with rule 3 of the Gujarat Sales Tax Rules, 1990. It was, accordingly, submitted that the say of the
petitioners that the goods are appropriated by the purchasers, that is, GAIL is contrary to the
provisions of the Contract Act, the Sale of Goods Act as well as terms of the PSC and the ISPA.
12.2 Next, it was submitted that in terms of the expression 'delivery point', the terms 'upstream' or
'downstream' are of great significance. The term 'upstream' is that stage of the production process
that involves searching for and extracting raw materials. This part of the production process does
not do anything with the material, such as processing it. It only deals with the finding and extraction
of the raw material. The term 'downstream' means the stage in the production process that involves
processing the materials collected during the upstream stage into a finished product. Further, the

downstream stage includes the actual sale of that product to other businesses, Government or
private individuals. The downstream process also has a direct contact with the customers through
the finished product. In the present case, in terms of the PSC and the ISPA, GAIL is to be given
sweetened gas and not sour gas which is processed on-shore at Hazira, Surat and thus, falls within
the purview of the term 'downstream'. It was submitted that the Production Sharing Contract is a
combined contract amongst the constituents of the Contractor for exploration, supply and sale of
gas and thus, contains other terms which govern the contract on royalty, profit sharing, natural gas,
price, title etc. whereas ISPA is an agreement between the Contractor of the PSC and GAIL as the
purchaser and defines that gas, which is domestically marketable is to be delivered to GAIL at Surat
as per the price mentioned in clause 21.5.13(b). Referring to the contents of clause 21.5.13(c) of the
PSC, it was submitted that this clause would have relevance to deny the contention of the petitioners
that the gas is processed first by the petitioners at the off- shore processing where it is separated
from oil. At the off-shore facility, the gas is removed from water to make the gas suitable for pipeline
conditions. It was submitted that this contention of the petitioners is wholly incorrect in view of the
provisions of clause 21.5.13(c) which reads as under:-
"The gas and condensate sold herein shall be separated into gas and condensate at
the off-shore processing facility, measured separately and recombined and delivered
at the 'Delivery Point' at the operating pressure of the buyer owned or contracted
pipeline up to a maximum pressure (maximum delivery pressure) of one thousand
(1,000) PSIG."
12.3 It was submitted that if the clause is carefully perused, it would mean that at the off-shore
processing platform which is Panna, gas and condensate are separated into gas and condensate,
measured separately and recombined and delivered at the delivery point. To be more precise, it
would mean that at the Panna platform, the component which is explored is combined in nature,
being gas and condensate which would also include crude oil. Thereafter, they are separated and
then measured and again recombined. This would mean that the goods would not be ascertainable.
Thus, from Panna platform after the gas and condensate are measured, they are recombined and it
is this recombined gas and condensate which reaches the T-Junction. Therefore at the T-Junction in
the ONGC pipeline both NANG and ANG is in a combined state. Mr. Jani further submitted that the
contention that the title of goods passes at T-Junction because the goods in question acquire the
characteristic of ascertained goods is incorrect and that reliance placed upon clause 21.5.13(a)(ii)
has no relevance and in fact, the Production Sharing Contract refers to 100% deliverability.
Referring to clause 21.5.13(e), it was submitted that the parties have acknowledged that Gas
Authority of India shall receive the Gas at Hazira. Simultaneously, clause 3 of the ISPA also is very
clear on the situs. Thus, it is clear that the parties have time and again acknowledged that the
delivery point shall be Hazira.
12.4 Mr. Jani next contended that the sale has not taken place in the course of import into the
territory of India. According to the learned counsel, the provisions of the Customs Act have been
made applicable to the area of Panna and Mukta and by virtue of the notification issued by the
Union of India, the customs frontiers have been extended to Panna- Mukta area and, therefore, for
the purpose of the Customs Act, Panna-Mukta is a part of India. Anything sent to Panna-Mukta
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 27B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
from anywhere in the country will not be subject to customs duty as also anything brought from
Panna-Mukta to land area of India will also not be subjected to customs duty. Therefore, the crude
and oil produced at Panna-Mukta is considered to have been produced in India. It was submitted
that in the light of the decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of Pride Foramar v. Union of
India (supra) and the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Aban Lloyd Chiles Offshore
Limited v. Union of India (supra), the goods which are brought from Panna-Mukta are deemed to be
goods from a part of India. Therefore, the goods which are brought from Panna- Mukta cannot be
said to have been imported into India. In support of his submissions, the learned counsel placed
reliance upon the following decisions:-
(i) M/s. Mahadev Rambali v. State of Bihar, AIR 1959 Patna 30, paragraphs 15, 16,
25, 35, 36,

Explosive Ltd., 1985 (4) SCC 119, paragraphs 4 and 6,
(x) Commissioner of Sales Tax v. Pure Helium, 49 VST 14 (Bom.) 12.5 The next
submission advanced by Mr. Jani was that it is necessary to consider the definition of
'manufacture' under section 2(16) of the Gujarat Sales Tax Act so as to appreciate the
fact that the processing which takes place at the ONGC plant at Hazira does not
merely involve removal of impurities as contended by the petitioners. The processing
makes the Gas a domestically marketable commodity. It was submitted that natural
gas from wells contains significant amounts of Sulphur, Carbon Dioxide and other
organic compounds. The natural gas, due to the presence of high content of
Hydrogen Sulphide has a rotten smell and is commonly known as sour gas. The
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 28B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
presence of Hydrogen Sulphide is undesirable because it makes the gas extremely
harmful and lethal to breathe and can be extremely corrosive. The gas is considered
sour if the content of Hydrogen Sulphide exceeds 5.7 mg per cubic metre of natural
gas. The process of removing Hydrogen Sulphide and other organic compounds from
sour gas is commonly referred to as sweetening and the gas is known as sweetened
gas. The attention of the court was invited to the process known as "Amine Process"
or alternatively, "Girdler Process" whereby Hydrogen Sulphide is removed from
natural gas. It was submitted that in the present case, it is only after the completion
of the said process of converting the natural gas/sour gas into sweetened gas that
GAIL takes delivery of the same which can be appreciated from Article 21.5.13(e) of
the Production Sharing Contract and the Interim Sales and Purchase Agreement. It
was submitted that the processing of natural gas is a very detailed and complex
procedure. Once the product is processed and manufactured, a new product comes
into existence. Therefore, what is in essence sold by the petitioners to the
Government's nominee is sweetened gas, processing of which is done at Hazira and,
therefore, a new product is sold at Hazira. In support of his submissions, the learned
counsel placed reliance upon the following decisions:-
(i) M/s. AIR Liquid North India Pvt. Ltd. v.
Commissioner, Central Excise, 2011 (9) SCALE 506, paragraphs 2-5, 13, 14, 17, 21-23,
(ii) Kumar Motors v. Commissioner of Sales Tax, 5 VST 646, paragraphs 4,5, 7,
(iii) B.P. Oil Mills v. Sales Tax Tribunal, AIR 1998 SC 3055, paragraph 7,
(iv) Laminated Packing v. Collector, Excise, 1990 (4) SCC 51,
(v) NE Packaged Drinking Water Manufacturers Ass. v. State of Assam, 58 VST 1
Gauhati, paragraphs 5, 7, 8,
(vi) Special Ref. No.1 of 2001 12.6 Mr. Jani further submitted that the aspect of
ascertainment also plays a significant and vital role in the contract. Reference was
made to the provisions of sections 18, 19, 21 and 22 of the Sale of Goods Act to submit
that where there is a contract for sale of ascertained goods, what has to be first
considered under section 19 of the said Act is the intention of the parties. Thus, the
intention of the parties can be very clearly understood from clause 21.5.13(e) of the
PSC as well as clause 3 of the ISPA. The second provision which has to be taken into
consideration is section 21 of the Sale of Goods Act which makes it very clear that
where there is a contract for ascertained goods, the title passes on putting the goods
into a deliverable state. According to the learned counsel, in the instant case, the title
would pass at Hazira for the reason that processing of natural gas whereby the
impurities are removed and the said gas is converted into sweetened gas is what
GAIL is receiving. The goods are not ascertained goods prior to such processing at
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 29B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
Hazira because there is no processing unit which ascertains the goods at the off-shore
T-Junction nor can the act which is done at Panna processing platform be termed to
be ascertainment for the reason that on exploration of gas and condensate, though
they are separately measured, they are recombined and sent to the T-Junction for
further transport. Therefore also, it cannot be said that ascertainment takes place at
the off-shore processing Panna platform. It was emphatically argued that the most
important word which requires due consideration is the word 'recombine' used in
clause 21.5.13(c) which means 'reunite'.
Therefore, on recombining, it loses the characteristic of being ascertained even if it were to be
assumed that the contention of the petitioner is accepted. It was submitted that it is thus relevant to
consider the provisions of section 22 of the Sale of Goods Act which clearly mention that where
there is a contract of ascertained goods in the deliverable state, but the seller is bound to weigh,
measure, test or do something for the purpose of ascertaining the price, the title of the goods shall
not pass, till the time such act is done. Therefore, if all the three provisions as well as Articles
21.5.13(e) and clause 3 of ISPA are read in a conjoint manner and applied to the present case, it
would simply mean that Hazira, Surat is the place where ascertainment of goods takes place and on
ascertaining only, the price gets fixed which is the specific intention of the parties to the contract.
Therefore, the definition of 'delivery point' is not relevant at this juncture. In support of his
submissions, the learned counsel placed reliance upon the following decisions:-
(1) Installment Supplies v. State of Orissa, AIR 9174 SC 1105, paragraphs 6, 10, 12 (2)
Usha Beltron Ltd. v. State of Punjab & Haryana, 2005 (7) SCC 58, paragraphs 5, 6, 7

10, 12 (4) The State of Madras v. M/s. Gannon Dunkerley and Co., (Madras) Ltd., AIR
1958 SC 560, paragraphs 16, 24, 26, 33, 44-47 (5) Union of India v. Binod Kumar
Agarwal, AIR 2013 Calcutta 52, paragraphs 14-17, 19, 20, 21 (6) Jute and Gunny
Brokers Ltd. v. The Union of India, AIR 1961 SC 1214 paragraphs 6-9, 11, 12 12.7 As
regards the action taken by the respondent authorities under section 44 of the GST
Act, it was submitted that the respondent authorities were required to carry out the
reassessment for the reason that the petitioners in their returns did not show the
transaction of Panna-Mukta and thus, evaded tax. It was after a search operation
being carried out that the respondent authority issued show-cause notices and
statutory notices for reassessment under section 44 of the GST Act. The petitioners
gave their replies to the same and after considering the same, the reassessment
orders were passed, which are subject matter of challenge in the petitions. In support
of his submission, the learned counsel placed reliance upon the decision of this court
in the case of Asian Paints India Ltd. v. Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax, Circle
2(6), [2006] 148 STC 532 (Guj), for the proposition that when an assessee files
return, it is his duty firstly, to disclose facts;
secondly, those which are material; thirdly, the disclosure must be full; and fourthly, true.
Assessment can be reopened on assessing officer's reason to believe regarding, based on specific
reliable and relevant information, subsequently received by him which tends to expose
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 30B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
untruthfulness or inadequacy of the material disclosed by the assessee on the basis of which original
assessment was made. Sufficiency of assessing officer's belief is not justiciable though the belief can
be questioned by the assessee on the ground of lack of bona fides and irrelevancy.
12.8 Lastly, it was submitted that it would be necessary for the court to first deal with the
preliminary contention that the petitions are not maintainable as the petitioners have an efficacious
alternative remedy by way of appeal before the appellate authority and in the facts of the present
case, the petitioners have already availed of such alternative statutory remedy under section 65 of
the Gujarat Sales Tax Act by preferring appeals before the appellate authority, which are pending for
final adjudication. It was submitted that the petitioners have simultaneously preferred these
petitions by challenging the very jurisdiction of the Sales Tax authorities in levying sales tax on the
ground that the sales have taken place beyond the territorial waters of India and thus, the State of
Gujarat has no jurisdiction to levy sales tax as delivery of natural gas in the light of clause
21.5.13(a)(iv) has taken place at upstream-weld underwater connection. Therefore, the court may
first deal with the primary objection as regards the maintainability of the petitions on the ground
that the petitioners have already availed of the alternative remedy and that they should be directed
to first exhaust the statutory remedy so availed. In support of such submission, the learned counsel
placed reliance upon the following decisions:-
(1) Titaghur Paper Mills Company Limited v. State of Orissa, AIR 1983 SC 603,
paragraphs 11, 12, (2) State of U.P. v. Rajya Khanij Vikas Nigam Sangharsh Samiti,

2005 SC 3971, paragraphs 4, 6, 9
13. Mr. Mihir Thakore, Senior Advocate, learned counsel for the respondent GAIL advanced the
following propositions:
Firstly, when natural gas comes to Hazira from Panna-Mukta gas field, there is no
import. As there is no import, it cannot be said that the Production Sharing Contract
read with the Interim Sales and Purchase Agreement occasions the import of natural
gas and it cannot be said that the sale or purchase of gas has taken place in the course
of import of goods into the territory of India in terms of the principles laid down in
section 5 of the Central Sales Tax Act. Consequently, Article 286 of the Constitution
of India does not prohibit the tax authorities under the Gujarat Sales Tax Act to
impose tax on the sale transaction between the petitioner and GAIL provided the sale
takes place in Gujarat. Secondly, since Panna-Mukta oil fields are in the Exclusive
Economic Zone, they are not in the territory of India or for that matter, in any State
or Union Territory. Whilst the Customs Act, 1962 has been extended by notifications
under the Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic Zone and Other
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 31B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
Maritime Zones Act, 1976 to the said area, no such notification extending Central
Sales Tax to the said area has been issued by the Central Government. Consequently,
transportation of gas from Panna-Mukta to Hazira pursuant to the PSC read with
ISPA and the sale thereof to GAIL cannot be said to be a sale of goods in the course of
any such trade or commerce and it cannot be said that the sale or purchase has
occasioned the movement of goods from one State to another as envisaged in section
3 of the CST Act. Consequently, Article 286 of the Constitution of India does not
prohibit tax authorities under the GST Act to impose tax on the sale transaction
between the petitioner and GAIL provided the sale takes place in Gujarat. It was
submitted that in view of the above propositions, the decisions cited by Mr.
Chidambaram and Mr. Soparkar on the interpretation of the phrase 'occasions such
import' under section 5 of the CST Act and 'occasions the movement of goods from
one State to another' under section 3 of the CST Act are irrelevant. It was submitted
that in view of the fact that neither has the sale of gas taken place in the course of
import of goods into the territory of India nor has such sale been occasioned by the
movement of goods from one State to another, the decisions cited by the learned
counsel on the issue as to what is 'manufacture' and whether sweetened natural gas is
different from sour natural gas, are irrelevant.
13.1 It was submitted that in the absence of the applicability of sections 3 and 5 of the
CST Act, the court will have to determine whether the sale of gas has been made
within the State of Gujarat as per section 2(28) of the GST Act read with section 4(2)
of the CST Act read with the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 to the extent
applicable. It was submitted that for determining whether sale has been made in
Gujarat, it would be pertinent to appreciate that the Production Sharing Contract
read with the Interim Sales and Purchase Agreement is not a contract of sale of
specific goods but is an agreement to sell future goods namely, natural gas to be
extracted from the well at Panna-Mukta oil fields and sweetened. Since it is an
agreement to sell future goods which had to be extracted and sweetened, section 19 of
the Sale of Goods Act which deals with sale of specific or ascertained goods has no
application. Similarly, sections 20 to 22, which also deal with specific goods, will have
no application.
According to the learned counsel, it is not necessary to determine the intention of the parties as to
when the property in gas is intended to be transferred to GAIL because, the situs of the sale has to be
determined in terms of section 4(2) of the CST Act, section 23 of the Sale of Goods Act being only a
guide. The terms of the contract, conduct of the parties and the circumstances are, therefore,
irrelevant.
13.2 According to the learned counsel, the only provision which is relevant to determine whether or
not the sale or purchase of gas has taken place inside the State of Gujarat for the purpose of sales tax
is section 4(2) of the CST Act which reads as under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 32B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
"(2) A sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed to take place inside a State, if the
goods are within a State. -
(a) In the case of specific or ascertained goods, at the time of the contract of sale is
made; and
(b) in the case of unascertained or future goods, at the time of their appropriation to
the contract of sale by the seller or by the buyer, whether assent of the other party is
prior or subsequent to such appropriation.
Explanation: Where there is a single contract of sale or purchase of goods situated at more places
than one, the provisions of this sub-section shall apply as if there were separate contracts in respect
of the goods at each of such places."
It was submitted that this section has to be interpreted in the light of the provisions of section 23 of
the Sale of Goods Act. The PSC read with ISPA as well as the subsequent Gas Sales Contract clearly
provide that what has to be delivered is sweetened gas. Irrespective of the fact whether sweetened
gas and sour gas are different commodities or not under the Sales Tax Act and irrespective of the
fact whether sweetening of gas is manufacturing or not, what is agreed to be sold is sweetened gas
and consequently, the sale of such goods would be deemed to take place at the time of their
appropriation to the contract of sale by the seller or the buyer. Such appropriation would be feasible
only when the goods as agreed to be sold come into existence which is possible only after
sweetening. The appropriation, therefore, takes place post sweetening. The appropriation of future
goods would only take place when the goods are completed and ready for delivery. In view of section
4(2)(b) of the CST Act, the sale of gas is deemed to take place inside the State of Gujarat and
consequently, such sales is liable to sales tax under the GST Act.
13.3 Elaborating upon the above propositions as well as dealing with the contentions raised on
behalf of the petitioners, Mr. Thakore submitted that GAIL is in substantial agreement with what is
submitted by the petitioner - BG Exploration in respect of the limitation on the power of the State
Government to impose sales tax. Reference was made to the provisions of Article 286 of the
Constitution of India read with the CST Act, 1956 to submit that there are limitations on the power
of the State to impose sales tax. It was submitted that however, GAIL does not agree with the
proposition that no recourse can be had to the Sale of Goods Act which is a pre-constitutional law
governing the sale of goods. While it is true that the principles contained in the CST Act alone have
to be considered for interpreting the provisions of the Act and in particular, in interpreting section
4(2) of the CST Act, recourse will have to be had to the Sale of Goods Act, inasmuch as, the CST Act
does not define 'specific goods' or 'future goods' and for understanding the meaning thereof, the Sale
of Goods Act will have to be looked at. Similarly, for understanding the meaning of 'ascertained' and
'unascertained' goods, the meaning thereof given in the judgments under the Sale of Goods Act will
have to be looked into. It was submitted that while there are differences in the language used in
section 23 of the Sale of Goods Act and section 4(2)(b) of the CST Act, there are substantial
similarities between the two and for proper appreciation of section 4(2)(b), recourse can be had to
the judgments delivered under section 23 of the Sale of Goods Act read with the definition of 'future
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 33B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
goods' and 'specific goods' given under section 2(6) and 2(14) of the Sale of Goods Act read with
section 6 thereof.
13.4 It was submitted that there can be no dispute with the proposition that the goods have to be
within the State at a certain point of time for the State to impose sales tax. This is evident from
explanation (1) to section 2(28) of the GST Act read with section 87 thereof along with its
explanation read with sections 3, 4 and 5 of the CST Act. It was submitted that there can also be no
dispute that for the parties to determine the situs of sale, section 4(2) of the CST Act can be looked
into. In fact, the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act, nowhere deal with the situs of sale. The
provisions of the Sale of Goods Act which deal with relation between the buyer and seller only lay
down the principles for determining when the title in property in goods passes. The CST Act on the
other hand deals with the issue as to who can levy sales tax on a transaction of sale. Referring to
sub-section (2) of section 4 of the CST Act, it was submitted that unlike the provisions of the Sale of
Goods Act, for the purpose of section 4(2) of the CST Act, it is irrelevant where the title of the
property in goods passes or has already passed or will pass. It was submitted that to illustrate,
suppose specific goods such as a motorcar is situated in Ahmedabad. The owner of the motorcar
agrees to sell his motorcar to the purchaser under a written contract signed by the owner - vendor
and the purchaser at Calcutta on 10th October, 2014 when the Car was at Ahmedabad. The terms of
contract provide that the property in car will pass to the purchaser when the full payment is made.
The payment will be made in installments within six months. The title in the property would pass on
the last instalment being paid on 1st July, 2014. By then the car is stationed in Calcutta. So far as the
Sale of Goods Act is concerned, the intention of the parties is that the property will pass on 1st July,
2014 and accordingly would actually pass on 1st July, 2014 at Calcutta. Yet for the purposes of the
GST Act, the Gujarat Sales Tax Authorities would be entitled to levy sales tax because on the date of
the contract, the car being specific goods was inside the State of Gujarat and that would be deemed
to be situs of sale under section 4(2) of the CST Act. It was submitted that, therefore, it is irrelevant
where and when the title passes.
13.5 Mr. Thakore next submitted that similarly in case of future goods where or when the title passes
to the buyer under the agreement entered into between the buyer and the seller is irrelevant. It shall,
for the purposes of section 4(2)(b) of the CST Act be considered to have been sold at the place where
the goods are situated, when appropriated to the contract with the assent of the parties. It is
irrelevant when they come into existence or where they come into existence or where the contract is
entered into or where it is agreed that the title of the goods under the contract passes. The only
factor relevant is where they are appropriated to the contract and for the purpose of it being
appropriated to the contract with the assent of the parties, they have to become goods agreed to be
sold between the parties. For the true and correct interpretation of section 4(2) of the CST Act,
reliance was placed upon the decision of the Madras High Court in the case of Arcot Mills Ltd. v.
State of Tamil Nadu, 1984 55 STC 536 (Madras) wherein the court had held that the special term in
the contract between the seller and buyer cannot prevail over a fiscal statute, or bind the taxing
department, whatever may be its binding force or merit as between the parties, as a term in the
contract. The rules laid down by sections 20 to 24 of the Sale of Goods Act for ascertaining when the
property in goods passes in a given transaction are to be applied only in cases where the intention of
the parties cannot be clearly spelt out from the terms of their bargain. Under the Sale of Goods Act,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 34B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
therefore, the parties' intention, if clearly expressed, will always prevail over the statute, for the very
purpose of that Act is to regulate the inter se relationship between the sellers and purchasers of
good. Not so the rules laid down in explanation (3) to section 2(n) of the Tamil Nadu General Sales
Tax Act or section 4(2) of the Central Sales Tax Act. For, these rules are special and overriding rules
for fixing the taxable event as between the public exchequer, on the one hand, and the taxpayers, on
the other. While the sales tax law takes up sales or purchases as taxable events, and to that extent,
goes along with the general law governing such transactions, the legislature has not thereby lost the
prerogative of bending the common law to the service of the revenue. The legislature has laid down
in the sales tax statutes clear-cut principles of determining the situs of sales and purchase in order
to bring about uniformity, certainty, economy in collection, and efficiency in tax management, all of
which are desiderata in all fiscal measures. These provisions, if they should serve their purpose at
all, must, in reason, override any special terms in private contracts to the contrary. Reliance was also
placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Madras Marine and Co. v. State of
Madras, (1986) 3 SCC 552.
13.6 Dealing with the contention raised by the petitioners that the sale of goods took place outside
the State of Gujarat, it was submitted that in this regard, it is important to determine whether the
goods are specific goods/ascertained goods or future goods. If the goods are specific goods, then
section 4(2)(a) will apply and the sale shall be deemed to take place inside the State, if the goods are
within the State at the time the contract of sale is made. Assuming without admitting that the
Production Sharing Contract is a contract of sale, then, if the goods are specific goods namely, those
which can be identified on that date the property in the goods would pass where they are situated on
the date of the PSC. As to whether mineral gas which is still to be extracted can be said to be
identified goods, it was submitted that the answer would be in the negative because the Gas has to
be extracted from the mine and until it is extracted, it will remain future goods. Consequently,
section 4(2)(a) of the CST Act will have no application to such goods. Reference was made to section
2(6) of the Sale of Goods Act which defines 'future goods' to mean goods to be manufactured or
produced or acquired by the seller after making the contract of sale. It was submitted that the gas
which has to be extracted are goods to be produced, after making of the PSC and are, therefore,
future goods. Reference was made to the following extract from 'Benjamin on Sale of Goods' to
submit that the same clearly establishes that the goods in question are future goods:-
"Existing and future goods. Section 5(1) of the Act provides that "the goods which
form the subject of a contract of sale may be either existing goods, owned or
possessed by the seller, or goods to be manufactured or acquired by him after the
making of the contract of sale, in this Act called future goods". It is clear that goods
which the seller neither owns nor possesses may be "existing" in an everyday sense
and yet "future goods" for the purposes of the Act. For instance, the seller may agree
to sell goods which at the time of the contract are in the ownership and possession of
a third party, and which he expects or hopes to acquire before performance is due.
The statutory definition of "future goods" refers simply to goods to be "manufactured
or acquired" by the seller. But a more elaborate classification may be made as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 35B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
(a) goods to be manufactured by the seller, whether form materials which are now in
existence or not; (b) goods which are to become, or may become, the property of the
seller, whether by purchase, gift, succession, occupation or otherwise; (c) goods
expected to come into existence as the property of the seller in the ordinary course of
nature, e.g. the young to be borne of his livestock, or the milk to be produced by his
cows; (d) things attached to or forming part of land (whether belonging to the seller
or another) which are to be severed in the future, e.g. minerals to be won, timber to
be cut, fixtures to be detached; and (e) crops in the category fructus industriales to be
grown by the seller in future."
13.7 Dealing with the submission made on behalf of the petitioners relying on the definition of
'Deliverability' that since all that gas that falls within the deliverability must be sold on daily basis to
the Government of India or its nominee under Article 21.5.13(b), the goods are specific or
ascertained goods, it was submitted that the same completely ignores the definition of 'future goods'
given under the Sale of Goods Act or in common law. It was submitted that the goods which are yet
to be produced or extracted can never be specific goods or ascertained goods. They will always be
future goods and only section 4(2)(b) of the CST Act would apply. In support of his submission, the
learned counsel placed reliance upon the King's Bench decision in the case of Underwood Ltd. v.
Burgh Castle Brick & Cement Syndicate, 1922 (1) KB 123 as well as the decision of the Andhra
Pradesh High Court in the case of Markapur Municipality v. Dodda Ramireddi, AIR 1972 A.P. 299.
13.8 It was submitted that the issue, therefore, is as to when such future goods can be said to be
appropriated to the contract. For that limited purpose and only for that limited purpose, one has to
see the terms of the PSC and the Interim Sales and Purchase Agreement as well as the Long Term
Gas Sales Contract entered into in 2008. It was submitted that according to the petitioners, the situs
of sale is at the T- Junction outside the State of Gujarat in respect of which reliance has been placed
upon Articles 27.1 and 27.2 of the PSC read with Articles 1.27, 21.5.13(a)(iii) and (iv), 21.5.13(b) and
21.5.13(c); that the title passes to the Government of India at the delivery point as defined under
Article 21.5.13(a)(iv) which is outside the territory of the State of Gujarat; that clause 3 of the ISPA is
not an agreement but Article 21.5.13(a)
(iv) which defines 'delivery point' and that the word 'delivered' therein must be understood as
'received' which is the word used in Article 21.5.13(e); that GAIL is not a party to the PSC and the
use of the word 'GAIL' in Article 21.5.13(e) is not because GAIL is a nominee, but because GAIL's
pipeline is situated thereat and the nominee has to receive gas at that point; and that the emphasis
of the petitioners is on the definition of 'delivery point' and that the PSC contemplated that the title
passes at the delivery point as stated in Article 27.2. It was submitted that in this argument, the
petitioners are contradicting themselves insofar as they are considering passing of title as a relevant
aspect for determining the situs of sale under the CST Act. It was submitted that neither the
intention of the parties under the agreement nor a clear understanding between the parties as to
where and when the title passes are relevant for the purpose of deciding the situs of sale. Situs of
sale has to be determined in terms of section 4(2)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 36B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
(b) of the CST Act for future goods. For the said purpose, only two requirements are necessary
namely, (i) where were the future goods situated at the time of their appropriation to the contract of
sale; and (2) whether both the parties assented to such appropriation. It was submitted that
irrespective of where the title passes and where the risk passes, GAIL was not bound to accept under
the contract, sour gas. The assent which GAIL had given or for that matter, GAIL's principal Union
of India had given was for sweetened gas. There is no scope, therefore, of appropriation with assent
of the parties till the gas is sweetened. It is in these circumstances that the goods were situated
factually in the State of Gujarat on the date of its appropriation, which necessarily would take place
post sweetening, at Hazira in Gujarat and, therefore, the sale is deemed to have taken place within
the State of Gujarat. In support of such contention, the learned counsel placed reliance upon the
following decisions:-
(1) Wilkinds v. Bromhed and Hutton, (1844) 6 M&G 963 (cid:128) 134 ER 1182-1189 (2)
Atkinson v. Bell, (1828) 8 B&C 277 (cid:128) 108 ER 1046-1049 (3) Mucklow v. Mangles,
(1808) 1 Taunt 318 (cid:128) 127 ER 856 (4) Bellamy v. Davey, (1891) 3 Ch 540 (5) Indian
Wood Products Co. Ltd. v. Sales Tax Officer, New Delhi & others, AIR 1968 Delhi 211
13.9 Dealing with the decisions on which reliance had been placed by the learned
counsel for the petitioners, it was submitted that reliance placed upon the decision of
the Supreme Court in A.V. Thomas & Co. Ltd. v Deputy Commissioner (supra) is
totally inapposite for the following reasons:-
(i) The judgment deals with the assessment period 1952-
1953 and interprets the provisions of Article 286 of the Constitution of India as it then stood.
(ii) Article 286 underwent a substantial change and clause (2) was substituted in 1956. After
substitution, clause (2) provides that Parliament may, by law, formulate principles for determining
when a sale or purchase of goods takes place in any of the ways mentioned in clause (1). Pursuant to
this amendment in Article 286, the Central Sales Tax Act was enacted in 1956 and section 4 operates
since then. The Supreme Court was concerned in that judgment with a period when there was no
section 4 of CST Act and was required to interpret the Explanation to clause (1) of Article 286, which
was also omitted by the Constitution 6th Amendment Act, 1956.
13.10 It was submitted that the decision of the Madras High Court in the case of Bengal Corporation
Pvt. Ltd. vs. The State of Madras (supra) primarily deals with section 5 of the CST Act and the
meaning of the term 'occasions the import' in section 5 of the CST Act. While dealing with section 5,
the Madras High Court interpreting section 4(2)(b) came to the conclusion that it is irrelevant where
the title in the goods passes under section 4(2)(b) and what is relevant is 'appropriation of property
to the contract' irrespective of the idea of passing of property. It was submitted that these
observations clearly support the submissions of GAIL. Reference was made to the observations
made by the court to the effect that in the case of a contract of sale of specific ascertained goods it is
the State in which the goods are situated at the time of the contract of sale that will have the power
to levy sales tax under section 4(2)(a), though the property in those goods may pass in some other
State. The court was of the opinion that the appropriation referred to in section 4(2)(b) signifies and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 37B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
connotes the earmarking and setting apart of the goods as specific goods to be delivered under the
contract of sale and does not signify an appropriation carrying with it the idea of passing of
property.
13.11 Mr. Thakore further submitted that insofar as the decision of the Delhi High Court in the case
of K.G. Khosla v. Chief Commissioner, Union Territory of Delhi (supra) is concerned, the said
judgment while being primarily concerned with section 3 of the CST Act also interprets section
4(2)(b) of the said Act. Referring to the following passage of the judgment, it was submitted that it is
evident that the provisions of the contract regarding passing of risks or property are completely
irrelevant for determining situs of sale and the question of appropriation has to be decided
irrespective of passing of property:-
"It is to be borne in mind that the term "appropriation may be used in two senses. It
may either mean simply the identification of the goods by agreement of parties as the
goods to which the contract of sale relates or it may mean the passing of the property
in the goods from the seller to the buyer by such means as delivery to the carrier etc.
The scheme of the Act shows that the element of passing of property is not relevant in
determining the situs of the sale. The question of appropriation of goods has to be
decided, therefore, irrespective of the passing of property. In other words, the
appropriation referred to in section 4(2)(b) connotes the setting apart of goods as
specific goods to be delivered under the contract of sale and not an appropriation
linked with passing of property. The Indian Wood Products Company Ltd., v. The
Sales Tax Officer, Ward No.13, New Delhi. (1968) 21 S.T.C. 437. Therefore, the fact
that the property in the goods moved from Faridabad to Delhi may not have passed
to the buyer but may still be in the petitioner did not prevent the appropriation of the
goods to the contract of sale within the meaning of section 4(2)
(b) of the Act. The appropriation took place when the unascertained or future goods
were manufactured in accordance with the specifications of the contract of sale and
in accordance with the agreement of the parties. For the same reason, therefore, the
petitioner lost the right of diversion of these goods to any other purpose in view of the
contract and the law would not be in pursuance of any right and is not, therefore,
relevant. We find, therefore, that the right to levy the inter-State sales tax on the sales
effected by the petitioner by the movement of the goods from Faridabad to Delhi
taking place as an incident of the contract of sale as contemplated by section 3(a) of
the Act was in the Sales-Tax authorities at Faridabad."
(emphasis supplied) In the facts of the present case, appropriation would be setting a part of the
goods namely, sweetened natural gas to be delivered which can only take place at Hazira. It was
submitted that in Indian Tourist Development Corporation v. CCT (supra), the Supreme Court was
concerned with the interpretation of section 5 of the CST Act in respect of the goods sold at duty free
shops which are not within the customs frontier of India and has no relevance for the purpose of
interpretation of section 4(2)(a) or 4(2)(b) of the CST Act. As regards the decision of the Karnataka
High Court in the case of State of Karnataka v. West Coast Paper Mills Ltd. (supra), it was submitted
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 38B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
that the said decision has absolutely no relevance to the issues arising in the matter as the same
deals with section 18 of the Sale of Goods Act in respect of passing of property in unascertained
goods which could have no bearing on the interpretation of section 4(2)(a) and 4(2)(b) of the CST
Act.
13.12 Dealing with the alternative submission that the sale in question is a sale in the course of
import into the territory of India, it was submitted that such submission is based on the proposition
that since the CST Act is not extended under section 7 of the Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf,
Exclusive Economic Zone and Other Maritime Zones Act, 1976 to the designated area under the
notification, the gas which comes to the mainland, has to be considered to be imported into the
territory of India. It was submitted that the CST Act does not define the term 'import' nor is the said
term defined in the General Clauses Act. Reference was made to section 2(ab) of the CST Act which
defines "crossing the customs frontiers of India" to mean crossing in the limits of the area of the
customs station in which imported goods or export goods are ordinarily kept before clearance by
customs authorities and the Explanation thereto says that for the purposes of that clause, "customs
station" and "customs authorities" shall have the same meanings as in the Customs Act, 1962.
Referring to section 5 of the CST Act, it was submitted that in both eventualities envisaged
thereunder, it has to be seen as to what are the customs frontiers of India. It was submitted that
when the designated area has been extended to include the High Seas where the Offshore Platform
is situated, that would be part of India for the purpose of import and hence, it cannot be said that
the sale has taken place in the course of import. In support of his submission, the learned counsel
placed reliance upon the decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of Commissioner of Sales
Tax v. Pure Helium, 2012 (49) VST 14. Referring to paragraph 11 of the said decision, it was
submitted that two propositions can be culled out therefrom, firstly, if the goods are sent from the
territory of India to a designated area, the same would not amount to export and section 5(1) would
not apply; and secondly, if the goods are brought into the territory of India from the designated
area, it would not amount to import and section 5(2) would not apply. It was submitted that the
designated area is not a part of India for the purpose of the CST Act but only for the purposes of the
Customs Act. If it is not a part of India for the CST Act, it is not a part of India under section 3 of the
CST Act for inter-State sale. Reliance was also placed upon the decision of the Bombay High Court
in the case of Pride Foramer v. Union of India, 2002 (148) ELT 19, as well as the decision of the
Supreme Court in the case of Aban Lloyd Chiles Offshore Limited (supra). It was submitted that in
view of the above judgments, since there is no import, there cannot be any sale in the course of
import for the purpose of the CST Act. It was submitted that reliance placed upon the decision of
this court in the case of Larsen & Toubro vs. Union of India (supra) is completely inappropriate as
the court was not concerned in the said matter with the issue as to whether the sale was in the
course of export. The attention of the court was invited to the following observations made in the
judgment:
"6. ... ... We have, therefore, proceeded to examine the grievances of the petitioners
on the basis of this conceded factual position, namely, that the title of the goods sold
by the petitioners to ONGC passed at ONGC site at Bombay High and not at Hazira.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 39B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
71. ... ... It was contended that since the sale can fall in only one of the three
categories, in the present case, the Court must hold that it is either inter-State sale or
a local sale since the contention that it was an export sale has not been pressed."
It was submitted that the only issue arising in Larsen & Toubro (supra) is whether the sale was in
the course of inter- State sale in which context, the Gujarat High Court has observed that the
Bombay High does not form part of any State of the Union of India and, therefore, movement of
goods does not get covered within the expression "from one State to another" as contained in section
3 of the CST Act. It was submitted that the decisions of the Supreme Court in the case of K.G. Khosla
v. Deputy Commissioner, Commercial Taxes, Indian Tourist Development Corporation v. Assistant
Commissioner, State of Maharashtra v. Embee Corporation, Indure Ltd. v. CTO, State of
Travancore, Cochin v. Bombay Company (supra) are of no relevance as there is no import of gas in
its movement from Panna-Mukta to Hazira.
13.13 Dealing with the contention that the contract was for the sale and purchase of all the natural
gas discovered and produced in the contract area as defined in the PSC and that sweetening of
natural gas does not amount to manufacture nor does it bring about another product and that after
sweetening, the goods remain natural gas, it was submitted that what has been agreed to be
delivered and accepted or received is sweetened gas. Consequently, whether sweetening changes the
nature of product or not, there can be no appropriation to the contract, unless the natural gas is
sweetened, which takes place at Hazira. In this context, it is irrelevant that the PSC provides for
100% of the deliverability of the natural gas. It was submitted that the distinction sought to be
drawn between appropriation and unconditionally appropriated in section 4(2)
(b) of the CST Act and section 23 of the Sale of Goods Act is a distinction without merit for when the
word 'appropriation' is used, it cannot have a distinct meaning than 'unconditionally appropriated'.
It was submitted that there is nothing in the PSC to indicate that appropriation takes place at the
delivery point, particularly when what has to be received by GAIL is sweetened gas.
13.14 As regards the submission that in any event, the Government of India or its nominee is obliged
to bear the burden of sales tax and if the petitioner is liable to pay sales tax, GAIL is obliged to
furnish Form 17 and 17B, it was submitted that GAIL had vide letter dated 24th November, 1999
categorically requested the petitioners - BG Exploration, ONGC and Reliance to pay sales tax and
recover the same. The petitioners, however, opted not to do so. The petitioners are, therefore, not
entitled to claim the same now in respect of the past period for GAIL would not be in a position to
recover the said amount from its customers who are spread all over the country. It was submitted
that the question of issuing Form No.17 and 17B in respect of that past period does not arise;
however, subsequent to the order dated 29th April, 2004 in Special Civil Application No.2071/2004
with connected matters, GAIL has provided Form No.17 and 17B from the said date. It was urged
that the petitioners are estopped from claiming any amount from GAIL, much less in the present
proceedings.
14. Mr. Saurabh Amin, learned advocate appearing on behalf of the Union of India adopted the
submissions advanced on behalf of respondent GAIL and reiterated the averments made in the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 40B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
affidavit-in-reply dated 15th April, 2004 filed on behalf of the respondent. The attention of the court
was invited to the averments made in paragraph A(iii) of the petition to submit that insofar as the
interpretation of the Production Sharing Contract and the Interim Gas Sales and Purchase
Agreement is concerned, the stand of the Union of India is that in the facts and circumstances of the
present case, the delivery point is on-shore at Hazira and the contention of the petitioner that the
delivery point is off-shore at the Panna- Mukta oil fields is denied. It was submitted that is further
the case of Union of India that the two PSCs executed between the constituents of the contractor and
the Union of India and the Interim Gas Sales and Purchase Agreement executed between the
contractor and the respondent No.7 - GAIL, as also the fact that the gas produced at Panna-Mukta
oil fields is incapable of being consumed till it is subjected to a sweetening process on- shore at
Hazira and the quantity of gas becomes unascertainable at Hazira, the delivery point is on-shore at
Hazira and the liability of sales tax, if any, has to be determined on the above basis.
15. In rejoinder, Mr. P. Chidambaram, learned counsel for the petitioner - BG Exploration submitted
that according to the respondents, the gas was produced in the deemed territory of India, the
delivery point is in the deemed territory of India and Hazira is in the territory of India and hence,
there can be no import into the territory of India. It was submitted that such argument is
misconceived for the reason that the area in which the gas is produced is deemed to be part of
territory of India only for the purpose of the Customs Act and the Customs Tariff Act which have
been extended by notification under the Maritime Zones Act. The CST Act and the GST Act have not
been so extended. For the purpose of CST Act, there is no deemed territory of India and no part of
the Continental Shelf or the Exclusive Economic Zone can be deemed to be part of the territory of
India. According to the learned counsel, the judgment of the Bombay High Court in Commissioner
of Sales Tax v. Pure Helium (supra) is per incuriam to the extent it observes:
"Export for the purposes of section 5(1) of the CST Act, 1956 cannot have a meaning
which is divorced from the applicability of the Customs Act, 1962 to a territory in
pursuance of a notification issued in exercise of the powers conferred upon the Union
Government in the Maritime Zones Act, 1976."
It was submitted that the 'export' in section 5(1) and 'import' in section 5(2) of the CST Act can be
given full meaning and effect if one understands the territory of India occurring in these two
sub-sections as the territory of India to which the CST Act extends under section 1(2) of that Act. It
was submitted that there is no deemed territory of India and there is no need to extend the CST Act
to any deemed territory. It was submitted that the High Court of Bombay appears to have
overlooked the fact that the CST Act could have been extended to the area but was not extended by
the Union of India. It was only the Customs Act that was extended. Just because the Customs Act
was extended, it does not mean that all other Acts would stand extended to where the gas wells, the
Offshore Platform and the delivery point is located. Reference was made to paragraph 68 of the
judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Aban Lloyd Chiles Offshore Limited (supra) to point
out that the court has clearly limited the operation of the legal fiction when it held that the
Continental Shelf and the Exclusive Economic Zone are deemed to be a part of India for the purpose
of such enactments which are extended to those areas.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 41B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
15.1 Mr. Chidambaram further submitted that the judgment that would be of relevance to the
present case is the judgment of this court in Larsen & Toubro v. Union of India (supra) wherein the
court correctly noticed that the CST Act has not been extended by notification to the Continental
Shelf or the Exclusive Economic Zone. It was submitted that since the CST Act has not been
extended to the area where the gas wells, Offshore Platform and the delivery point are located, the
CST Act must be read and applied as it stands without the deeming fiction that any extended area is
part of the territory of India. Similarly, since the GST Act has not been extended to the areas in
question, no tax can be levied or demanded under the GST Act. It was submitted that, therefore, the
gas wells, Offshore Platform and delivery point being located outside the territory of India, any
movement of goods from a place outside the territory of India to a place within the territory of India
will indeed be a movement in the course of import of goods into the territory of India. Any sale
which occasions such import would fall within section 5(2) of the CST Act and would, therefore, be
outside the purview of the GST Act.
15.2 As regards the contention raised by the learned Additional Advocate General regarding the
maintainability of the petitions, it was submitted that since the assessment orders dated 3rd
January, 2004 and 9th January, 2004 for the five years are wholly without jurisdiction, the
petitioners had filed the present writ petitions to quash the orders and to declare that the sale of
natural gas by the petitioner to Government of India cannot be taxed in view of Article 286 of the
Constitution read with section 5 of the CST Act. It was submitted that the petitions are maintainable
because the impugned assessment orders are without jurisdiction and because they were passed by
reopening the assessments without having "reason to believe" that any turnover had escaped
assessment. It was submitted that the petitioner is not obliged to avail of the alternative remedy but
can maintain a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. In support of his
submissions, the learned counsel placed reliance upon the decisions of the Supreme Court in the
case of Raza Textiles v. Income Tax Officer, (1973) 1 SCC 633; in the case of Whirlpool Corporation
v. Registrar of Trademarks, (1998) 8 SCC 1 and in the case of Godrej Sala Lee v. Assistant
Commissioner, (2009) 14 SCC 338. It was further submitted that the writ petitions were admitted in
the year 2004, after elaborate hearing and interim order was passed by the Division Bench on 29th
April, 2004 pursuant to which the petitioner paid tax at the rate of 4% with interest at 18% for the
year 1997-98 to 2001-02 and for the year 2002-03 and 2003-04 and for the period after 1st April,
2004 the petitioner paid tax at the rate of 4% until the tax regime changed on 1st April, 2005. It was
submitted that at this stage, it would be iniquitous to ask the petitioner to avail of the alternative
remedy without deciding the constitutional and legal issues that arise and that have been argued
extensively in these proceedings. In support of his submission, the learned counsel placed reliance
upon the decision of this court in the case of Pioma Industries v. Union of India, 2011 (273) ELT 54
as well as the decision of the Supreme Court in Indian Tourist Development Corporation through
Hotel Ashoka v. Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes (supra).
15.3 It was further submitted that at the bar, counsel for the respondents have made a number of
statements and assertions that are not supported by pleadings or documents which are inter alia as
under:-
• Customs frontiers have been extended to the exclusive economic zone.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 42B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
• The words export/import are not defined in the CST Act.
Hence, for the purpose of sale in the course of import under section 5(2) of the CST
Act, exclusive economic zone is a part of the territory of India.
• The PSC is not a contract of sale.
• The parties to the PSC, by their conduct, have agreed to
replace the PSC with ISPA.
• The word 'delivered' used in paragraph 3 of ISPA should
be read as 'Delivery Point'.
• The PSC is a contract for the sale of sweetened gas.
• GAIL can refuse to take the Gas if it is not according to
specifications required by it. Hence, the Gas has to be put into a 'deliverable state'.
• The petitioner lacks bona fides because it has not produced the ISPA or even the
PSC.
It was submitted that these statements and assertions have no basis whatsoever and
must be disregarded.
16. In the backdrop of the facts and contentions noted hereinabove, the moot question that arises for
consideration is whether the sale of natural gas pursuant to the PSC executed between the
petitioners and the Central Government and the ISPA executed between the petitioners and GAIL,
the nominee of the Central Government, has taken place within the State of Gujarat. It is an
admitted position, which even otherwise cannot be disputed that in view of the provisions of Article
286 of the Constitution of India, a State Government cannot impose sales tax where the sale takes
place outside the State or during the course of import of goods into the territory of India. Therefore,
two questions are required to be determined. Firstly as to whether the sale of goods has taken place
within the State of Gujarat; and secondly, whether such sale has taken place during the course of
import of goods into the territory of India. Of course, if the first question is answered in the
negative, the second question becomes redundant, inasmuch as, if the sale has not taken place
within the State of Gujarat the question as to whether such sale has taken place during the course of
import of goods into the territory of India pales into insignificance.
17. The petitioners claim that the sale of natural gas to GAIL as nominee of the Government of India
does not fall within the ambit of the GST Act and as such the sales are not amenable to tax under the
provisions of the said Act. Since, the case relates to the applicability or otherwise of the provisions of
the GST Act, it may be germane to refer to section 87 of the said Act which reads thus:
"87. Certain sales and purchases not liable to tax. Nothing in this Act or the rules
made thereunder shall be deemed to impose or authorise the imposition of a tax on
any sale or purchase of any goods, where such sale or purchase takes place.-
(i) in the course of inter-State trade or commerce, or
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 43B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
(ii) outside the state, or
(iii) in the course of import of the goods into the territory of India or export of the
goods out of such territory, and the provisions of this Act and the rules shall be read
and construed accordingly.
Explanation:- For the purpose of this section whether a sale or purchase takes place--
(a) in the course of inter-State trade or commerce, or
(b) outside the State, or
(c) in the course of import of the goods into the territory of India or export of goods out of such
territory, shall be determined in accordance with the principles specified in section 3, 4 and 5 of the
Central Sales Tax Act, 1956.
18. On a plain reading of section 87 of the GST Act, it is clear that the same provides that it is not
permissible for the State to impose any tax on sale or purchase of goods in three eventualities.
Firstly, if such sale is in the course of inter-State trade or commerce; secondly, if such sale has taken
place outside the State; and thirdly, if such sale has taken place in the course of import of goods into
the territory of India or export of goods out of such territory. As to whether such sale has taken place
in any of the above eventualities, has to be determined in accordance with the principles specified in
section 3, 4 and 5 of the CST Act.
19. For the purpose of ascertaining as to whether a sale has taken place in the course of inter-State
trade or commerce, one has to refer to the principles specified in section 3 of the CST Act which
postulates as to when a sale or purchase of goods is said to take place in the course of inter-State
trade. However, in the present case, it is an admitted position between the parties that sale of the
goods in question is not in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. Consequently, it is not
necessary to refer to the provisions of section 3 of the CST Act. Of course, the learned counsel for the
respective parties have referred to several decisions on the interpretation of section 3 of the CST Act,
but the same have been relied upon to contend that the purport of the words "in the course of" used
in section 3 and section 5 of the CST Act is the same.
20. The next eventuality contemplated under section 87 of the GST Act is when such sale has taken
place outside the State. For the purpose of determining this question the principles as specified in
section 4 of the CST Act would be required to be applied. As to when a sale or purchase of goods can
be said to take place outside a State is provided under section 4 of the CST Act, which reads thus:
4. When is a sale or purchase of goods said to take place outside a State.-- (1) Subject
to the provisions contained in section 3, when a sale or purchase of goods is
determined in accordance with sub-section (2) to take place inside a State, such sale
or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place outside all other States.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 44B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
(2) A sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed to take place inside a State, if the goods are within
the State--
(a) in the case of specific or ascertained goods, at the time the contract of sale is made; and
(b) in the case of unascertained or future goods, at the time of their appropriation to the contract of
sale by the seller or by the buyer, whether assent of the other party is prior or subsequent to such
appropriation. Explanation.-- Where there is a single contract of sale or purchase of goods situated
at more places than one, the provisions of this sub-section shall apply as if there were separate
contracts in respect of the goods at each of such places.
Thus, under sub-section (1) of section 4 of the CST Act, if a sale or purchase of goods is determined
in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (2) of section 4 to have taken place inside a State,
then subject to the provisions of section 3, such sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed to have
taken place outside all States. Therefore, for the purpose of determining whether the sale of goods in
the instant case has taken place within the State of Gujarat, it would be necessary to examine the
facts of the case in the light of sub-section (2) of section 4 of the Act.
21. In essence and substance, what has to be seen under sub-section (2) of section 4 of the CST Act is
the situs of the goods, in the case of ascertained goods, at the time of the contract of sale and in the
case of unascertained or future goods, at the time of their appropriation to the contract of sale.
22. On behalf of the petitioners, it has been contended that the goods in question were ascertained
goods at the time of the contract of sale. According to the petitioners, the goods were always specific
or ascertained goods because the volume of Gas to be produced, sold and delivered is captured in
the word "Deliverability" as defined in Article 21.5.13(a)(iii). All gas that falls within "Deliverability"
must be sold on a daily basis to the Government of India or its nominee under Article 21.5.13(b) and
that the goods were outside the State of Gujarat at the time when the contract of sale was made. The
contention raised by the petitioners has been resisted by the respondents on the ground that the sale
of goods is for unascertained and future goods and therefore, the first part of sub-section (2) of
section 4 would not apply.
23. Before dealing with the rival contentions, reference may be made to the decisions on which
reliance has been placed by the learned counsel for the respective parties.
23.1 In a pre-bifurcation decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of Emperor v. Kunverji
Kavasji Kavarana, AIR 1941 Bombay 106, the court has held that the expression 'specific goods'
necessarily means goods capable of being ascertained with certainty - cerium est quod cerium reddi
potest. The words, 'specific goods' would, according to their natural interpretation mean goods
whose delivery can be demanded in specie. A contract to sell some liquor out of a big cask containing
a much larger quantity, the required quantify not being separated or bottled, would not be a contract
of sale of specific goods within the meaning of section 21. A contract of sale of a small quantify of
liquor stored in bulk can more properly be regarded as contract for sale of unascertained goods. The
ownership will not pass till the quantity ordered by the petitioner is ascertained and appropriated.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 45B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
The bottling of the liquor would be an act of ascertainment and appropriation.
23.2 In State of Karnataka v. West Coast Paper Mills (supra), the Karnataka High Court was
considering the question as to when did the property in the goods (in Bamboos) pass to the
company - was it when the bamboos were cut and extracted from the forest land or when they were
actually lifted from the forest through any specified out-post. There was no specific clause in the
agreement in this regard in the matter. The court, accordingly, observed that it had to ascertain the
same with due regard to the rules applicable to the transaction of sale of unascertained goods by
description and terms of the agreement. The court held thus:
"13. Section 18 of the Sale of Goods Act provides that where there is a contract for sale
of unascertained goods, no property in goods is transferred to the buyer unless and
until the goods are ascertained. That would be so even where price of goods is agreed
and paid in advance, because neither seller nor the buyer could say which of such
unascertained goods is sold or purchased. In the instant case, the Company was
permitted to remove bamboos from certain areas in Yellapur Forest Division. Under
the agreement, the Company had a standing licence to enter into specified forest area
to cut and severe bamboos which it wanted to appropriate towards the contract. The
Company's servants had to go around the specified areas in the forest, select the
bamboos for its use, extract and appropriate the same towards the agreement. In
other words, unless and until the Company chooses to severe and separate the
bamboos standing on the forest land, the goods are not ascertained. When the
Company actually cuts and extricates the bamboos, the goods being ascertained and
also being in deliverable state, the property in goods passes to the Company."
"14. ... ... It will be seen from Clause-8 that the bamboos extracted would remain at
the sole risk of the Company and the company had to make its own arrangement for
preserving or protecting the same from accidental fire. Even if the extracted bamboos
were destroyed by fire, the Company would still be liable to pay the price and the
sales tax in addition to fine that may be imposed by the competent authority. Since
the Company was required to preserve the extracted bamboos at its own risk, the
intention of the parties would seem to suggest that the property in bamboos stood
transferred to the Company the moment it was severed and taken possession of by
the Company, because generally though not always, the goods sold are at the seller's
risk until the property in them is transferred to the buyer and only when the property
is transferred to the buyer, the goods are at the buyer's risk, whether goods are
actually delivered or not."
23.3 In Mucklow v. Mangles, (1) TAUNT 318, it was held that if a person contracts with another for a
chattel which is not in existence at the time of the contract, though he pays him the whole value in
advance, and the other proceeds to execute the order, the buyer acquires no property in the chattels
till it is finished and delivered to him. The court held that if the thing be in existence at the time of
the order, the property of it passes by the contract, but not so, where the subject is to be made.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 46B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
23.4 In Atkinson v. Bell (supra), the court held that where goods are ordered to be made, while they
are in progress, the materials belong to the maker. The property does not vest in the party who gives
the order until the thing ordered is completed. And although while the goods are in progress, the
maker may intend them for the person ordering, still he may afterwards deliver them to another,
and thereby vest the property in that other. The court further held thus:-
"But if you employ another to work up his own materials in making a chattel, then he
may appropriate the produce of that labour and materials to any other person. No
right to maintain any action vests in him during the progress of the work; but when
the chattel has assumed the character bargained for, and the employer accepted it,
the party employed may maintain an action for goods sold and delivered; or if the
employer refuses to accept, a special action on the case for such refusal. But he
cannot maintain an action for work and labour, because his labour was bestowed on
his own materials, and for himself, and not for the person who employed him. I
think, that in this case the plaintiff cannot recover on the count for work and labour."
23.5 In Markapur Municipality v. Dodda Ramireddi (supra), the Andhra Pradesh High Court held
thus:-
"4. But the true nature of the transaction appears to me to be a sale of future
unascertained goods. Reference may now be made to some of the provisions of the
Indian Sale of Goods Act. Under Section 2(6), "future goods" means goods to be
manufactured or produced or acquired by the seller after the making of the contract
of sale. Under Section 6(1), the goods which form the subject of a contact of sale may
be either existing goods, owned or possessed by the seller, or future goods. Under
Section 6(2) there may be a contract for the sale of goods the acquisition of which by
the seller depends upon a contingency which may or may not happen. Section 6(3)
lays down that where by a contract of sale, the seller purports to effect a present sale
of future goods, the contract operates as an agreement to sell the goods. As per
Section 23, in the case of a sale of unascertained or future goods, the property in the
goods passes to the buyer only when the goods are in a deliverable state and are
unconditionally appropriated to the contract either by the seller with the consent of
the buyer or by the buyer with the consent of the seller. Under Section 26, the goods
remain at the seller's risk until the property passes to the buyer. It is apparent from
the foregoing provisions that the law permits the sale of future ascertained or
contingent goods".
24. For the purpose of deciding as to whether the goods in question were ascertained goods at the
time when the contract of sale came to be made, it may be necessary to refer to certain recitals in the
PSC. Article 9 refers to Discovery, Development and Production. On a perusal of the contents
thereof, it is apparent that the stage of entering into the contract was prior to the discovery within
the contract area. In case of a new discovery having potential commercial interest an appraisal
programme was required to be submitted by the contractor. Article 21 deals with Natural Gas and
Article 21.1 says that subject to Article 21.2, the Indian domestic market shall have the first call on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 47B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
the utilisation of Natural Gas discovered pursuant to Petroleum Operations and produced from the
contract area. Article 21 further provides for the eventualities in case where a new discovery of crude
oil containing ANG and NANG is made. Therefore, at the stage when the PSC was entered, natural
gas was not yet discovered and hence, the contention that the goods were ascertained goods because
one hundred percent of the deliverability had to be delivered to the Buyer cannot be accepted.
Merely because, 100% of the deliverability of ANG and NANG and condensate was agreed to be
produced and delivered, would not make the goods ascertained goods, while still in the wells and at
a stage when they were not even discovered. Besides, a perusal of clauses 21.4.3, 21.4.4, 21.4.5,
21.4.6 and 21.4.7, reveals that in the event of discovery of Crude Oil containing ANG, if the
Contractor wishes to exploit the Excess ANG for sale, such ANG is required to be offered for sale to
the Government (or its nominee). If the Government exercises its option to purchase the excess
ANG, a particular course of action is required to be adopted and in case it does not desire to exercise
its option, another course of action is required to be adopted. Therefore, at the stage of entering into
the PSC it is not even certain whether the Government or its nominee would purchase all the excess
ANG. Similarly in respect of NANG the provisions of Article 21.5.1 to 21.5.12 of the PSC are required
to be complied with. It is only if the Government exercises its option to purchase the Excess ANG
and NANG, that resort would be required to be made to clause 21.5.13 of the PSC, which contains
the clause about 100% deliverability. Therefore, at the time when the PSC was executed, not only
were the goods, future goods, it was not certain whether the Government would purchase all the
Excess ANG and NANG. Under the circumstances, the goods in question, viz. Natural Gas, cannot
be said to be ascertained goods at the time when the contract was made, as claimed by the
petitioners. Clause (a) of sub- section (2) of section 4 of the CST Act, therefore, would not be
attracted. Having regard to the factual position as narrated hereinabove, it is not necessary to enter
into any discussion in respect of the principles enunciated in the above decisions and their
applicability or otherwise to the facts of the present case.
25. The next question that arises for consideration is as to whether the goods in question were
within the State of Gujarat at the time of their appropriation to the contract of sale by the seller or by
the buyer, whether the assent of the other party was prior or subsequent to such appropriation, so as
to fall within the ambit of clause (b) of section 4(2) of the CST Act. On behalf of the petitioners, it
has been alternatively submitted that if the goods are unascertained or future goods, they were
appropriated to the contract on a daily basis when they were delivered at the Delivery Point to
ONGC's Bassein Hazira pipeline and that the seller and buyer assented to such appropriation.
Whereas it is the case of the respondents that appropriation of the goods did not take place at the
Bassein Hazira pipeline of ONGC but downstream of ONGC's separation and sweetening facility at
Hazira, within the State of Gujarat, as what was agreed to be purchased was sweetened gas and not
sour gas. Therefore, the buyer did not assent to appropriation of the goods at the Bassein Hazira
pipeline and hence, the sale of the goods in question falls within the ambit of clause (b) of
sub-section (2) of section 4 of the CST Act and is a sale within the State of Gujarat. Thus, the crucial
question that arises for consideration is the situs of the goods in question at the time of their
appropriation to the contract of sale.
26. The learned counsel for the respective parties have placed reliance on the following decisions on
the question as to when unascertained goods can be said to have been appropriated to the contract
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 48B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
of sale.
26.1 In A.V. Thomas and Co. Ltd. vs. Deputy Commissioner of Agricultural Income Tax and Sales
Tax (supra), the Supreme Court held thus:-
"9. It has been founded and it has not been disputed that the title to the goods in the
present case passed at Fort Cochin. The purchase money was paid there and the
purchaser obtained from the auctioneer delivery notes directing the godown keepers
at Willingdon Island to deliver the goods and only the actual physical delivery of the
goods took place at Willingdon Island. In these circumstances the question is
whether the sale was "outside" or "inside sale" as the expressions have been
compendiously used in various judgments to indicate sales taking place within a State
or without it. The Explanation to Article 286(1)(a) which has been set out above
explains what a sale outside the State is. According to that Explanation a fiction is
created as between two States, one where the goods are delivered for consumption in
that State and the other where the title in the goods passed and the former is treated
as the situs of the taxable event to the exclusion of the latter. Therefore where the
Explanation applies the difficulty about the situs is resolved but in a case like the
present one the difficulty still remains because the Explanation does not operate in
the sense that the rival States claiming to tax the same taxable event are not the
States of delivery for consumption in that State and those where the title in the goods
passes. In somewhat similar circumstances this court in Indian Copper Corporation
Ltd. v. State of Bihar, (1961) 2 SCR 276 held by a majority decision that the opening
words of Article 286(1) which speak of a sale or purchase taking place and the non-
obstante clause in the Explanation which refers to the general law relating to the sale
of goods, indicated that it was the "passing of property within the State" that was
intended to be fastened on, for the purpose of determining, whether the sale in
question was "inside" or "outside" the State and therefore subject to the operation of
the "Explanation", the State in which property passed would be the only State which
would have the power to levy a tax on the sale. At p. 286 it was observed:
"The conclusion reached therefore is that where the property in the goods passed
within a State as a direct result of the sale, the sale transaction is not outside the State
for the purpose of Article 286(1)(a) unless the Explanation operates".
The majority decision in Indian Copper Corporation Ltd. v. State of Bihar concludes the point in
favour of the appellant. On the facts of this case it was found by the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal
that in regard to the sales of tea in full lots the property passed at Fort Cochin and this view has not
been challenged in this court. Therefore, on the majority decision in Indian Copper Corporation Ltd.
v. State of Bihar the only State which would have the power to levy a tax on such sale would be the
State of Madras and so far as Travancore Cochin was concerned, the sale would be an outside sale.
10. In the present case therefore the sale was an "outside sale" and cannot be said to be an "inside
sale" qua Travancore Cochin because the title passed at Fort Cochin which is in the State of Madras.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 49B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
Apart from that money was paid there and the delivery order was also received there even though
the actual physical delivery of goods was made at Willingdon Island in the State of Travancore
Cochin. The fiction created by the Explanation to Article 286(1)(a) is inapplicable because there was
no delivery as a direct result of sale for the purpose of consumption in any particular State."
As is apparent on a plain reading of the above decision, the same was rendered in relation to a
period when the Explanation to clause (1)(a)of Article 286 was in force. The said Explanation, which
was omitted by the Constitution (6th Amendment) Act, 1956, provided for the determination of the
situs of the sale according to legal fiction, namely, that of actual delivery as a direct result of the sale
for the purpose of consumption in a State. This resulted in a difference of opinion in the Supreme
Court, as to what constituted 'actual delivery' and 'consumption' read with the Explanation. [Bengal
Immunity v. State of Bihar, (1955) 2 SCR 603]. In order to obviate such controversy, the CST Act has
adopted the simple test of the physical location of the goods for determining the situs of the sale.
The above decision, therefore, may not be very relevant for the purpose of the controversy involved
in the present case.
26.2 In Arcot Mills Limited v. State of Tamil Nadu (supra), the Madras High Court held that the
special term in the contract cannot bind the fiscal statute or bind the tax department, whatever may
be its binding force or merit as between the parties, as a term in the contract. The rules laid down by
sections 20 to 24 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 for ascertaining when the property in goods passes
in a given transaction are to be applied only in cases where the intention of the parties cannot be
clearly spelt out from the terms of their bargain. Under the Sale of Goods Act, therefore, the parties'
intention, if clearly expressed, will always prevail over the statute, for the very purpose of that Act is
to regulate the inter se relationship between the sellers and the purchasers of the goods. Not so the
rules laid down in explanation 3 to section 2(n) of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act, 1949 or
section 4(2) of the Central Sales tax Act. For, these rules are special and overriding rules for fixing
the taxable event, as between the public exchequer, on the one hand and the taxpayers, on the other.
While the sales tax law taxes up sales or purchases as taxable events, and to that extent, goes along
with the general law governing such transactions, the legislature has not thereby lost the prerogative
of bending the rules of common law to the service of the revenue. The legislature has laid down in
the sales tax statutes clear-cut principles for determining the situs of sales and purchase in order to
bring about uniformity, certainty, economy in collection, and efficiency in tax management, all of
which are desiderata in all fiscal measures. These provisions, if they should service their purpose at
all, must, in reason, override any special terms in private contracts to the contrary.
26.3 In Bengal Corporation Private Ltd. v. State of Madras (supra), the Madras High Court was of
the opinion that the appropriation referred to in section 4(2)(b) signifies and connotes the
earmarking and setting apart of goods as specified goods to be delivered under the contract of sale
and does not signify an appropriation carrying with it the idea of passing of property. The court held
that in the case of a contract of sale of specified and ascertained goods, it is the State in which the
goods are situated at the time of the contract of sale that will have the power to levy the sales tax
under section 4(2)(a) though the property in those cases may pass in some other State. The court
observed that it is quite legitimate to presume that when Parliament enacted the Central Sales Tax
Act of 1956, its evident undoubted object was to formulate one single uniform test regarding the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 50B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
locale of the sale in all the States and that the lawmakers were well aware that in all the Sales Tax
Acts, passing of property was not regarded as a nexus but the locale of the goods within the State
either at the time of the contract of sale or later at the time of the appropriation.
26.4 In Wilkins v. Bromhead and Hutton (supra), the court held thus:-
"As to the first point, there can be no doubt but that a contract for the making of a
chattel, does not of itself vest the property in the chattel, when completed, in the
person giving the order. But here, the question turns, not upon the original contract
between the plaintiff and Smith and Bryant, but upon the circumstances which
afterwards took place, viz. the payment by the plaintiff, after the greenhouse had
been completed, of the stipulated price, the appropriation and setting apart by the
bankrupts of the greenhouse for the plaintiff, and his assent to such appropriation.
There was an appropriation on the one side, and an assent to such appropriation on
the other; which, I think, was quite sufficient to pass the property to the plaintiff. It
may be, that the original contract did not pass the property; but the parties may be
said to have entered into a new contract. I cannot conceive why, under the
circumstances of this case, the property in an article made to order should not pass
upon its completion, as it would have done if it had been in existence at the time of
the original contract. The objections raised upon this point were mainly founded
upon Atkinson v. Bell (8 B. & C. 277, 2 Mann. & Ryl. 292). But, if that case be
examined, it will be found not to apply. The decision there turned entirely on the
absence of assent on the part of the purchases to the appropriation of the machines
by the vendor. It is said, by Bayley J., "These were Sleddon's goods, although they
were intended for the defendants, and he had written to tell them so. If they had
expressed their assent, then this case would have been within Rohde v. Thwaites (6 B.
& C. 388, 9 Dowl. & Ryl. 293), and there would have been a complete appropriation,
vesting the property in the defendants. But there was not any such assent to the
appropriation made by the bankrupt; and, therefore, no action for goods bargained
and sold was maintainable." Holroyd J. observes, "I think the action will not lie for
goods bargained and sold, because there was no specific appropriation of the
machines assented to by the purchasers, and the property in the goods therefore
remained in the maker." And Littledale J. adds, "There could not be any sale in this
case, unless there was an assent, by the defendants, to take the articles."
Looking as the facts of this case, it seems to me that there is complete evidence of assent on the part
of the plaintiff, to the appropriation made by the vendors. The plaintiff was informed by letter that
the greenhouse was finished, and was requested to remit the price. He did so, at the same time
requesting the vendors to keep the greenhouse for him until he sent for it. It has been argued, that
the letter of the plaintiff, desiring Smith and Bryant to keep the greenhouse for him, was written
before the article was seen, and that it would be hard if it were held to be such an acceptance as
would preclude him from rejecting the article if it afterwards turned out defective in its construction.
If a purchaser's assent to the appropriation was shown to have been obtained by misrepresentation,
it seems to me it would probably be held to be no assent at all. But that is not the case here; and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 51B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
although the plaintiff thought proper to assent to the appropriation without seeing the greenhouse,
the assent was not the less complete. Upon this point, therefore, I think that the property vested in
the plaintiff, so as to enable him to maintain this action.
With respect to the second point, as the motion is to enter a nonsuit only, the rule ought, in
strictness, to be discharged, if there was any evidence to go to the jury. But perhaps it would be too
strict, under the circumstances, to hold the defendants within that precise limit. If the court saw that
there was any evidence which might make any difference in the finding of the jury, it would be but
just and right to allow the defendants an opportunity to try the cause again. I confess, however, I
cannot see any ground on which the jury could come to the conclusion that there was any reputed
ownership in the bankrupts. I think, therefore, that this point also fails. Consequently, the rule must
be discharged.
ERSKINE J. I also think that this rule should be discharged. With respect to the first point, I am of
opinion, on the authority of the cases relied upon for the defendants, that the property in this
greenhouse passed to the plaintiff. It is conceded, on all hands, that the rule laid down in Mucklow
v. Mangles (1 Taunt, 318. Vide post, 979 (a), is the correct one, viz. that, while the article remains
unfinished, no property in it passes, notwithstanding the vendor may intend it for the purchaser, or
may put his name upon it, or otherwise show an intention to appropriate it, and that a payment of
money on account makes no difference. Here, however, the greenhouse was completed, and after it
was so completed the makers appropriated it to the purchaser. The latter, before paying for it, might
have required to see it; but, instead of doing so, he transmitted the price. But that is not all; he also
requested the bankrupts to keep the greenhouse for him, thereby assenting to the appropriation
which they had made. When the latter deposited it with Wait, they gave notice that it was the
plaintiff's property, and requested Wait to take care of it for him. The reason why it was held in
Atkinson v. Bell (8B. & C. 277, Mann. & Ryl, 292) that the action for goods bargained and sold could
not be maintained, was, that, although there had been an appropriation, no assent, on the part of the
persons for whom the articles were made, had been shown. The language of the judges, as read by
the Lord Chief Justice, shows that to have been the only ground on which the case was decided. "If,"
says Baylej J., "the defendants had expressed their assent, then this case would have been within
Rohde v. Thwaites (6 B. & C. 388, 9 D. & R. 293), and there would have been a complete
appropriation, vesting the property in the defendants." What was the assent in Rohde v. Thwaites (6
B. & C. 388, 9 D. & R. 293), which was, in that learned judge's opinion, sufficient to pass the
property? There, the vendee never saw the sugar; but, having received a message from the seller that
they were ready for him, he sent word back that he would take them away as soon as he could: and it
was held to be such an assent that the property passed. Moreover, there is here a strong fact which
did not appear in Rohde v. Thwaites; for the purchaser paid the price, and requested the vendors to
keep the greenhouse for him. It appears to me that the property completely passed to the plaintiff,
and that if the article had been accidentally destroyed while in the possession of the bankrupts or of
Wait, it would have been the plaintiff's loss."
26.5 In Wait and James v. Midland Bank (Bristol Corporation Enter-Pleaders), 1926 Lloyd's List
Law Reports Volume 24 - 313, the King's Bench Division held thus:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 52B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
"The next point which is interposed against the claim of the bank is an objection that
this method of ascertainment by exhaustion, as it was usefully expressed by Mr.
Rayner Goddard, is not a method of ascertainment which does ascertain but that the
only effective way of ascertaining the goods which are in bulk such as these and which
are sold by weight, is by weighing; and I agree that the most usual and most natural
way is to weigh. But I am not prepared to hold that this is the only way of ascertaining
the goods dealt with, and that without such weighing there could be no
ascertainment. It is not a case such as may arise under Sect. 18 of the Sale of Goods
Act, where weighing is required for the purpose of ascertaining the price. There is no
such requirement in this case. On the contrary, there are in the rules of the Bristol
Channel & West of England Corn Trade Association, which are made part of this
contract, somewhat elaborate provisions such as those in Rules 16, 17 and 18, for
there being an excess or a deficiency in the quantity delivered. It seems to me that
ascertainment might take place by any method which is satisfactory to the parties
concerned. If the Dock Committee and the bank of Messrs Redlers chose to deal with
this matter by measurement instead of by weight there would be nothing to prevent
them."
26.6 In K.G. Khosla v. Chief Commissioner, Union Territory of India (supra) the Delhi High Court
was of the view that the term 'appropriation' may be used in two senses. It may either mean simply
the identification of the goods by an agreement of parties as the goods to which the contract of sale
relates or it may mean the passing of the property in the goods from the seller to the buyer by such
means as delivery to the carrier, etc. The court observed that the scheme of the Act shows that the
element of passing of property is not of relevance in determining the situs of the sale. The question
of appropriation of goods has to be decided, therefore, irrespective of passing of the property. In
other words, appropriation referred to in section 4(2)(b) connotes the setting apart of goods as
specific goods to be delivered under the contract of sale and not an appropriation linked with
passing of property. The court in the facts of the said case held that the appropriation took place
when the ascertained or future goods were manufactured in accordance with the specifications of
the contract of sale and in accordance with the agreement of the parties. For the same reason,
therefore, the petitioner lost the right of diversion of these goods to any other person in view of the
contract and the law. Diversion made contrary to the contract and law would not be in pursuance of
any right and is, therefore, not relevant.
26.7 In Indian Wood Products Co. Ltd. v. Sales Tax Officer (supra), the Delhi High Court observed
that since the goods in question were unascertained, consequently, the place where the sale is
effected will have to be determined under section 4(2)(b) of the CST Act. Under section 4(2)(b), the
place of sale depends upon the location of the goods at the time of their appropriation to the
contract of sale. The court pointed out that section 4(2)(b) does not require an unconditional
appropriation as required by section 23 of the Sale of Goods Act. The question that, therefore, arose
was whether under section 4(2)(b) the location of sale depends on mere appropriation of goods to
the contract or unconditional appropriation thereof. The court observed that the term
'appropriation' may be used in the sense that the goods are identified by the agreement of the parties
as the goods about which they are contracting, so that the contract can never apply to any other
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 53B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
goods. In other words, the goods are so far appropriated that the seller would, by delivering any
other goods, break the contract though the goods still remain the seller's property. The court
observed that the Scheme of the Sales Tax Act goes to show that the Parliament left out of account
the element of passing of property as of no relevance in determining the situs of sale and the
question of appropriation of goods has to be decided, irrespective of the passing of property. In
other words, the appropriation referred to in section 4(2)(b) connotes the setting apart of goods as
specific goods to be delivered under the contract of sale and not an appropriation linked with
passing of property. The court held that the term unconditional appropriation existed in the Sale of
Goods Act, years before the enactment of the Central Sales Tax Act, and if the Parliament intended
to convey the same idea, the Parliament would not have omitted the word 'unconditionally' in
section 4(2)(b).
26.8 In Re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd (in receivership), (1994) 2 All ER 806, the Privy Council held
thus:-
"It is common ground that the contracts in question were for the sale of
unascertained goods. For present purposes, two species of unascertained goods may
be distinguished. First, there are 'generic goods'. These are sold on terms which
preserve the seller's freedom to decide for himself how and from what source he will
obtain goods answering the contractual description. Secondly, there are 'goods sold
ex-bulk'. By this expression their Lordships denote goods which are by express
stipulation to be supplied from a fixed and a pre- determined source, from within
which the seller may make his own choice (unless the contract requires it to be made
in some other way) but outside which he may not go. For example, 'I sell you 60 of
the 100 sheep now on my farm'.
Approaching these situations a priori common sense dictates that the buyer cannot
acquire title until it is known to what goods the title relates. Whether the property
then passes will depend upon the intention of the parties and in particular on
whether there has been a consensual appropriation of particular goods to the
contract. On the latter question the law is not straightforward, and if it had been
decisive of the present appeal it would have been necessary to examine cases such as
Carlos Federspiel & Co SA v Charles Twigg & Co Ltd [1957] 1 Lloyd's Rep 240 and
other cases cited in argument. In fact, however, the case turns not on appropriation
but on ascertainment, and on the latter the law has never been in doubt. It makes no
difference what the parties intended if what they intend is impossible: as is the case
with an immediate transfer of title to goods whose identity is not yet known."
26.9 In Peare Lal - Kishan Prasad v. Diwan Singh - Ganeshi Lal (supra), the Allahabad High Court
held thus:-
"In Seath v. Moore (1), at p. 370, it has been held that it is a question of the
construction of the contract in each case at what stage the property shall pass and it is
a question of fact in each case whether that stage has been reached. It was held in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 54B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
Shoshi Mohan Pal v. Nobo Kristo Poddar (2), at p. 805, that where in a contract for
sale of rice so far as vendors were concerned, nothing remained to be done on their
part to the rice sold "for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of the price," and the
fact that the purchaser has to do something to the goods for his own satisfaction,
namely weighing the rice does not prevent the completion of the sale. There is a
distinction between a case where something remains to be done by the vendor to the
goods for the purpose of putting them into a state in which the vendee is to take them
and a case where the vendee for his own satisfaction wants to get the goods weighed
for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of the price. This distinction has been
recognized in a number of cases and appears to be well founded: Annan v. Dubar
Sheikh (3) (at p. 41 of 26 O.C.) and Abdul Aziz v. Jogendra Krishna Roy (4) (at p.
115). Two rules of civil law appear to have been incorporated both in the Sale of
Goods Act and in the Indian Statute with which we are concerned. These rules have
been stated by Blackburn, J, to be as follows (Contract of Sale, third edition, 1910, p.
184):
"They are two fold : the first is that where, by the agreement, the seller is to do
anything to the goods for the purpose of putting them into that state in which the
buyer is to be bound to accept them, or, as it is sometimes worded, into a deliverable
state, the performance of those things shall (in the absence of circumstances
indicating a contrary intention) be taken to be a condition precedent to the vesting of
the property.
The second is, that where anything remains to be done to the goods for the purpose of
ascertaining the price, as by weighing, measuring, or testing the goods where the
price is to depend on the quantify or quality of the goods; the performance of these
things, also shall be a condition precedent to the transfer of the property, although
the individual goods be ascertained, and they are in the state in which they ought to
be accepted."
In Simmons v. Swift (5) (at p. 862) the rule has been enunciated as follows:
"Generally speaking, where a bargain is made for the purchase of goods and nothing
is said about payment or delivery, this property passes immediately so as to cast upon
the purchaser all future risks, if nothing further remains to be done to the goods:
although he cannot take them away without paying the price. If anything remains to
be done on the part of the seller, until that is done the property is not changed."
The real question in all such cases is whether the parties did intend that property should pass:
Turley v. Bales (6) (at p. 203) and Martineau v. Kitching (7).
The true test therefore is what was the intention of the parties."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 55B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
The court further observed that the word 'ascertained' has not been defined or explained in the
Indian Contract Act. According to Chitty (Law of Contracts, 17th edn.1921, p.462) the expression
means "goods which the parties have agreed upon as the goods to be appropriated to the contract".
26.10 In Underwood Limited v. Burgh Castle Brick and Cement Syndicate, 1 K.B. 123, it was held
thus:-
"The sale was that of a specific chattel to be delivered by the plaintiffs, but the fact
that it was to be delivered by them is not the test whether the property passed. The
test is whether anything remained to be done to the engine by the sellers to put it into
a deliverable state; and by that I understand a state in which the thing will be the
article contracted for by the buyer; I do not mean deliverable in the sense that it is
properly packed or anything of that kind. It must have everything done to it that the
sellers had to do to it as an article."
26.11 In P.S.N.S. Ambalavana Chettiar v. Express Newspapers Limited, Bombay (supra), the
Supreme Court held that section 18 of the Sale of Goods Act provides that where there is a contract
for sale of unascertained goods, no property in the goods is transferred to the buyer unless and until
the goods are ascertained. It is a condition precedent to the passing of property under a contract of
sale that the goods are ascertained. The condition is not fulfilled where there is a contract for sale on
a portion of a specific large stock. Till the portion is identified and appropriated to the contract, no
property passes to the buyer.
26.12 In Jute and Gunny Brokers Ltd. v. Union of India (supra), it was contended on behalf of the
Union of India that property in the goods cannot pass in law to the holders of the pucca delivery
orders till the goods are actually appropriated to the particular order; therefore, as in that case it was
not in dispute that no goods were actually appropriated towards the pucca delivery orders
concerned, the property in the goods did not pass to the holders thereof but was still in the mills.
Reliance in this connection was placed on Section 18 of the Indian Sale of Goods Act, 3 of 1930. That
section lays down that "where there is a contract for the sale of unascertained goods, no property in
the goods is transferred to the buyer unless and until the goods are ascertained." The Supreme Court
held that in the said case, it was not in dispute that the goods covered by the pucca delivery orders
were not ascertained at the time such orders were issued and ascertainment would take place in the
shape of appropriation when the goods were actually delivered in compliance therewith. Therefore,
till appropriation takes place and goods were actually delivered, they are not ascertained. The
contract therefore represented by the pucca delivery orders was a contract for the sale of
unascertained goods and no property in the goods was transferred to the buyer in view of section 18
of the Indian Sale of Goods Act till the goods were ascertained by appropriation, which in that case
took place at the time only of actual delivery.
26.13 In DLF Universal v. Director, T & C Planning, Haryana, AIR 2011 SC 1463, the Supreme Court
held thus:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 56B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
"11. It is settled principle in law that a contract is interpreted according to its purpose.
The purpose of a contract is the interests, objectives, values, policy that the contract
is designed to actualize. It comprises joint intent of the parties. Every such contract
expresses the autonomy of the contractual parties' private will. It creates reasonable,
legally protected expectations between the parties and reliance on its results.
Consistent with the character of purposive interpretation, the court is required to
determine the ultimate purpose of a contract primarily by the joint intent of the
parties at the time the contract so formed. It is not the intent of a single party; it is
the joint intent of both parties and the joint intent of the parties is to be discovered
from the entirety of the contract and the circumstances surrounding its formation."
26.14 In Her Highness Maharani Shantadevi Gaekwad v. Savjibhai Patel, 2001 (3) GLR 2097
(supra), a Division Bench of this court held that where several deeds form a part of a transaction and
are contemporaneously executed, they have the same effect for all purposes such as are relevant to
that case as if they were one deed. Each is executed but the fate of all the others being executed also
is intended to speak only as part of one transaction, and if one is seeking to make equities apply to
the parties, they must be equities arising within the transaction as a whole.
26.15 In S. Chhattanatha Karayalar v. Central Bank of India (supra), the Supreme Court held that
the principle is well-established that if the transaction is contained in more than one document
between the same parties, they must be read and interpreted together and they have the same legal
effect for all purposes as if they are one document.
27. The above decisions can be classified into three categories. The first category is the decisions
which lay down principles in the context of section 4(2) of the CST Act; the second category is the
decisions rendered in the context of the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act; and the third category is
the decisions as regards how the contracts are required to be construed.
28. The principles enunciated in the above decisions can be briefly culled out thus:
CATEGORY I
(i) Under the Sale of Goods Act, the parties' intention, if clearly expressed, will always
prevail over the statute, for the very purpose of that Act is to regulate the inter se
relationship between the sellers and the purchasers of the goods. Not so the rules laid
down in the relevant State Sales Tax Act or sec-
tion 4(2) of the Central Sales tax Act. For, these rules are spe- cial and overriding rules for fixing the
taxable event, as between the public exchequer, on the one hand and the tax- payers, on the other.
In all the Sales Tax Acts, passing of prop- erty is not regarded as a nexus but the locale of the goods
within the State either at the time of the contract of sale or later at the time of appropriation.
(ii) The scheme of the Sales Tax Act shows that the element of passing of property is not of relevance
in determining the situs of the sale. The question of appropriation of goods has to be decided,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 57B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
therefore, irrespective of passing of the property. In other words, appropriation referred to in
section 4(2)(b) connotes the setting apart of goods as specific goods to be delivered under the
contract of sale and not an appropriation linked with passing of property.
(iii) The appropriation referred to in section 4(2)(b) connotes the setting apart of goods as specific
goods to be delivered under the contract of sale and not an appropriation linked with passing of
property. The term unconditional appropriation existed in the Sale of Goods Act, years before the
enactment of the Central Sales Tax Act, and if the Parliament intended to convey the same idea, the
Parliament would not have omitted the word 'unconditionally' in section 4(2)(b).
CATEGORY II
(i) When there is an appropriation on the one side, and an assent to such appropriation on the
other; it is sufficient to pass the property to the plaintiff.
(ii) Ascertainment might take place by any method which is satisfactory to the parties concerned.
(iii) The buyer cannot acquire title until it is known to what goods the title relates. Whether the
property then passes will depend upon the intention of the parties and in particular on whether
there has been a consensual appropriation of particular goods to the contract. It makes no difference
what the parties intended if what they intend is impossible: as is the case with an immediate transfer
of title to goods whose identity is not yet known.
(iv) Where a bargain is made for the purchase of goods and nothing is said about payment or
delivery, this property passes immediately so as to cast upon the purchaser all future risks, if
nothing further remains to be done to the goods, although he cannot take them away without paying
the price. If anything remains to be done on the part of the seller, until that is done the property is
not changed.
(v) The term deliverable means that everything must be done to the article that the sellers had to do
to it as an article.
(vi) It is a condition precedent to the passing of property under a contract of sale that the goods are
ascertained. The condition is not fulfilled where there is a contract for sale on a portion of a specific
large stock. Till the portion is identified and appropriated to the contract, no property passes to the
buyer.
(vii) Till appropriation takes place and goods are actually delivered, they are not ascertained.
CATEGORY III
(i) The court is required to determine the ultimate purpose of a contract primarily by the joint intent
of the parties at the time the contract so formed. It is not the intent of a single party; it is the joint
intent of both parties and the joint intent of the parties is to be discovered from the entirety of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 58B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
contract and the circumstances surrounding its formation.
(ii) If the transaction is contained in more than one document between the same parties, they must
be read and interpreted together and they have the same legal effect for all purposes as if they are
one document.
(iii) Where several deeds form a part of a transaction and are contemporaneously executed, they
have the same effect for all purposes such as are relevant to that case as if they were one deed.
29. The vexed question that arises is as regards the situs of the goods at the time of appropriation to
the contract. The sale of natural gas to GAIL is governed by two contracts, firstly the Production
Sharing Contract between the Government of India and the Contractor, viz. ONGCL, RIL and
BGEPIL and the Interim Sales Purchase Agreement (ISPA) between the Contractor and GAIL. For
the purpose of deciding the situs of the goods at the time of appropriation to the contract, it would
be necessary to refer to certain recitals from the PSC as well as the ISPA to understand what the
parties had agreed. Since the sale transaction is contained in two documents, as held by the
Supreme Court in DLF Universal v. Director, T & C Planning, Haryana (supra) and S. Chhattanatha
Karayalar v. Central Bank of India (supra) and this court in Her Highness Maharani Shantadevi
Gaekwad v. Savjibhai Patel, it would be necessary to read and interpret them together and joint
intent of the parties would be required to be discovered from the entirety of the contract and the
circumstances surrounding their formation.
30. A perusal of the recitals contained in the ISPA shows that what has been agreed to be sold is
Natural Gas. The price clause says that the Buyer shall pay to the Sellers at the rate of 90% of gas
price specified in Article 21.5.13(d) of the PSC for the net MMBtu of gas delivered at the downstream
of ONGC processing facility at Hazira (on account basis as directed by the Ministry of Petroleum and
Natural Gas). The payment shall be made by the Buyer within thirty days of receipt of each monthly
invoice from Sellers to be raised on the basis of quantity of gas delivered to the buyer downstream of
the separation and sweetening facilities owned and operated by ONGC at Hazira as certified by
ONGC.
31. On a reading of the ISPA as a whole, it emerges that there is no reference to sale of sweetened
Gas as is sought to be contended by the respondents. The respondents want to read the term
"sweetened gas" into the ISPA, in view of the fact that Gas has to be delivered to the buyer
downstream of the separation and sweetening facilities owned and operated by ONGC at Hazira.
32. The covenants in respect of Natural Gas are contained in Article 21 of the PSC. Reference may be
made to the following sub-articles, which would be relevant for the purpose of deciding the
controversy in issue:
21.4.3 If the contractor wishes to exploit the Excess ANG such ANG shall first be
offered for sale to the Government or its nominee in writing in accordance with the
terms of the contract. On receipt of such offer the Government or its nominee is
required to exercise its option to purchase the Excess ANG.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 59B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
Thus, by virtue of Article 21.4.3, the Excess ANG has to be first offered for sale to the Government or
its nominee in accordance with the terms of the contract.
21.4.4 If the Government exercises its option to purchase the Excess ANG as provided in Article
21.4.3:
(a) The Government shall indicate in the notice exercising the option, a date, within
two (2) years of the date of the Contractor's offer, for commencement of purchase of
the Excess ANG.;
(b) within six (6) months of the date of notification of the exercise of the
Government's option pursuant to Article 21.4.3., the Contractor and the Government
(or its nominee) shall agree on the terms of the sale to the Government (or its
nominee) of Excess ANG.
Therefore, by virtue of clause (b) of Article 21.4.4, the terms of sale are to be agreed after the
Government (or its nominee) exercises its option to purchase the Excess ANG. If the Government
does not exercise its option, the contractor is free to explore markets for commercial exploitation of
Excess ANG. If the excess ANG cannot be commercially exploited or the Contractor is not able to
find a market, the Government is entitled to take and utilize such Excess ANG. If the Government
elects to take the Excess ANG, the Contractor is required to deliver such Excess ANG to the
Government or its nominee free of cost, at the downstream flange of the Gas/Oil separation facilities
and the Government or its nominee shall bear all costs including gathering, treating, processing and
transporting costs beyond the downstream flange of the Gas/Oil separation facilities.
32.1 Article 21.5.13 provides that the price of ANG and NANG produced from the Oil or Gas Field for
use in India shall be specified in the Gas sales contract which shall be in accordance with the
provisions of this Article 21.5.13. Thus, the price of ANG and NANG has to be specified in the Gas
sales contract and has to be in accordance with the provisions of Article 21.5.13.
32.2 Clause (a) of Article 21.5.13 contains certain definitions which are for the purposes of that
sub-Article alone. The terms defined are:
(i) British Thermal Unit, (ii) Buyer, (iii) Deliverability, (iv) Delivery Point, (v)
Maximum Delivery Pressure, (vi) MMBTU and
(vii) Seller.
32.3 For the purpose of appreciating the controversy in issue, it may be necessary to refer to the
following definitions:
(i) "Buyer" means the Government of India or its nominee.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 60B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
(ii) "Deliverability" means the lesser of the maximum aggregate rate of all wells in the
Contract Area or the maximum delivery capacity of the processing facility, subject to
generally accepted international petroleum industry prices.
(iii) "Delivery Point" means the upstream weld at the underwater connection between
Sellers' pipeline and ONGC's underwater Gas transmission line or lines which
transport Gas from the Bassein Field to the Hazira area.
(iv) "Seller" means Contractor.
The central question involved in the present case is whether the Natural Gas is appropriated to the
contract at the Delivery Point as envisaged under the PSC or Downstream of ONGCL's sweetening
and separation facility at Hazira as contended by the respondents.
32.4 Clause (b) of Article 21.5.13 says that the Seller agrees to produce and deliver, on a daily basis,
to the Buyer one hundred percent of the Deliverability of ANG and NANG and Condensate delivered
therewith at the Delivery Point and the Buyer, provided the Gas and Condensate are made available
and tendered for delivery by the Seller, agrees to take and purchase, on a daily basis, one hundred
percent of the Deliverability of ANG and NANG and Condensate delivered therewith, provided,
however, that Seller, at the Sellers's sole discretion, subject to generally accepted operator practices
in the international petroleum industry, may adjust deliveries to provide for necessary maintenance,
service and testing. Buyer may request that Seller vary deliveries to accommodate similar
circumstances in the Buyer's operation and Seller's approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Communications procedures shall be mutually agreed in the Gas sales contract in accordance with
internationally accepted industry standards.
32.5 Thus, by virtue of clause (b) of Article 21.5.13 the parties, viz. the Government of India and the
Contractor have agreed that the Seller shall produce and deliver, on a daily basis 100% of the
Deliverability of ANG and NANG and Condensate to the Buyer at the Delivery Point. The Buyer,
namely the Government of India and its nominee has agreed to take and purchase, on a daily basis
100% of the Deliverability of ANG and NANG and Condensate, provided the Seller makes available
the Gas and Condensate and tenders the same for delivery. On a plain reading of the above clause,
the Seller has to produce and deliver 100% of the Deliverability of ANG and NANG and Condensate
on a daily basis to the Buyer at the Delivery Point and the Buyer has to take and purchase the Gas
and Condensate so delivered. The "Delivery Point" envisaged in this clause would be in terms of
sub-clause (iv) of clause (a) inasmuch as clause (a) provides that unless the context otherwise
requires the words and terms defined thereunder wherever used and appearing in Article 21.5.13
shall have the meaning provided therein. Moreover, "Delivery Point" is not defined elsewhere in the
PSC nor is it defined under the ISPA.
32.6 Clause (c) of Article 21.5.13 of the PSC provides that the Gas and Condensate sold under the
said agreement shall be separated into Gas and Condensate at the offshore processing facility,
measured separately, and recombined and delivered at the Delivery Point at the operating pressure
of the Buyer's owned or contracted pipeline up to a maximum pressure of one thousand psig. Under
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 61B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
this clause, the Gas and Condensate are first required to be separated at the offshore processing
facility, measured and recombined and then delivered at the Delivery Point. The expression
"Delivery Point"
in clause (c) would also mean "Delivery Point" as defined in clause (a)(iv) of Article
21.5.13 and hence, as a natural corollary, reference to the offshore processing facility
therein would be to the offshore processing facility of the Contractor/sellers at
Panna-Mukta.
32.7 Clause (d) of Article 21.5.13 of the PSC is the price clause which sets out the
manner in which the price is to be calculated.
32.8 Clause (e) of Article 21.5.13 of the PSC which is relevant and falls for
interpretation says that parties acknowledge that Gas is to be received by GAIL at
Hazira downstream of separation and sweetening facilities owned and operated by
ONGC. The clause further provides that in order to compensate ONGC for the cost of
ownership and operations of these facilities, Contractor shall make payments to
ONGC on the basis of the costs fixed on an incremental basis by an internationally
recognised expert who shall be selected by two members of the operating committee
from a panel of three internationally recognised experts selected by ONGC. In case
there is no agreement between the Companies and ONGC on the advice tendered, the
matter shall be referred to Government. The decision of Government shall be final
and binding on all the Parties.
32.9 Article 34.2 of the PSC provides that this Contract shall not be amended,
modified, varied or supplemented in any respect except by an instrument in writing
signed by all the Parties, which shall state the date upon which the amendment or
modification shall become effective. Thus, the PSC can be amended, modified or
varied only by an instrument in writing by the parties to the PSC.
33. At the outset, it may be apposite to note that reference to GAIL in Clause (e) of
Article 21.5.13 of the PSC is not in its capacity as a nominee of the Government of
India, inasmuch as, at the stage when the PSC came to be executed, GAIL was not
named as a nominee of the Government of India. What the clause provides is that the
parties acknowledge that Gas is to be received by GAIL at Hazira downstream of
ONGC's sweetening and separation facility. It may also be pertinent to note that the
expression used is "acknowledge" and not "agree" and Gas is to be received by GAIL
and not delivered to it. Though the term "received" may be synonymous with the
term "delivered", in the context in which the expression "received" is used, there is a
clear distinction between the two, which shall be elaborated hereinafter.
34. The fact regarding reference to GAIL not being in its capacity as nominee of the
Government of India has been pointed out by the petitioner to the respondent
Commissioner of Sales Tax in its letter dated 3rd September, 1999 wherein it has
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 62B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
been stated that the Delivery Point of Panna-Mukta gas is offshore underline
connections at ONGC's existing pipeline, where the title passed to Government of
India (or its nominee GAIL) (Reference Article 12.5.13(a)(iv) in 21.5.13(e) and Article
27.2 of PSC). It has further been stated that this gas together with ONGC's own gas,
passes through ONGC owned sweetening facilities. As a matter of gesture of
commercial cooperation and under commercial expediency, JV agreed to compensate
ONGC for the incremental cost of ownership and operation of the sweetening
facilities. This factor however, does not affect the delivery point and passing of title to
the buyer at the offshore delivery point. In its letter dated 23 September, 1999 (page
43) the petitioner has stated that compensation to ONGC for sweetening the
associated natural gas from Panna was deliberated and agreed during Production
Sharing Contract negotiations. Installation of a sweetening facility at the Panna
processing platform was determined not to be cost effective. In any case, the
associated natural gas from Panna is commingled with ONGC gas in the ONGC
pipeline and would require re-sweetening which would make the process redundant.
The current arrangement is typical of most gas purchase and sales agreements in
which commingling of gas takes place during transportation. In the letter dated 28 th
January 2002 (Exh-C2) of Enron Oil & Gas (the predecessor of the petitioner B.G.
Exploration) addressed to the Additional Commissioner of Sales Tax, it has been,
inter alia, stated that the company and similarly ONGC, RIL and Government of
India for their respective share entitlements send invoices to GAIL for re-delivered
quantity of gas [delivered quantity minus (-) 4% (transportation and processing loss)
which ONCG deducts while certifying quantity re-delivered to GAIL. The quantity of
gas is measured at offshore processing facility as per article 21.5.13(c) of the PSC. The
sale is based on this measurement, and the carrier, i.e. ONGCL deducts the
transportation and processing losses. No further measurement is taken after the
sweetening process at Hazira. Under Article 21.5.13(b), the JV has to sell 100% of its
gas deliverability to GAIL who is nominee of the Government of India. When the gas
is handed over to the carrier, ONGCL for the purpose of transmission to the buyer,
the JV does not reserve the right of disposal as the gas is fully appropriated for the
sale to GAIL. In paragraph 14 of the said letter, it is stated that the sale of natural gas
at Panna-Mukta oil/gas fields was as per agreement, and the goods were ascertained
on and when measured at the offshore platform's measuring unit called LACT (Lease
Automated Custody Transfer Point). It was further the case of the petitioner that the
contract is for sale of Natural Gas, its sweetening when the sale has taken place
outside India is of no consequence. The sweetening process means the removal of
some sediment or some non-hydrocarbons (sulphur) which does not change the
character of gas. Sweetening is done by ONGC and it is by way of operational reasons,
business expediency and goodwill that they bear the cost thereof. This in no way
affects the relevant fact of the matter, which is that it is only the natural gas, which is
sold in accordance with the agreement.
35. The question as regards the stage when appropriation of the goods has taken place has to be
considered in the light of the peculiar nature of the goods, viz. Natural Gas, which cannot be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 63B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
transported in the manner in which ordinary goods are transported. The facts on record reveal that
the Gas and Condensate sold under the PSC are, in terms of Article 21.5.13(c), to be separated into
Gas and Condensate at the offshore processing facility, measured separately, and recombined and
delivered at the Delivery Point at the operating pressure of the Buyer's owned or contracted pipeline
up to a maximum pressure of one thousand psig. Under this clause, the gas and condensate are first
required to be separated at the offshore processing facility, measured and recombined and then
delivered at the Delivery Point. Delivery point is defined in clause 21.5.13(a)(iv) as the upstream
weld at the underwater connection between Seller's pipeline and ONGC's underwater Gas
transmission line or lines which transport Gas from Bassein Field to the Hazira area. Therefore, the
Natural Gas produced by the Contractor is delivered to the Government of India or its nominee at
the Delivery Point as envisaged in Article 21.5.13(a) (iv) of the PSC. At this juncture reference may
also be made to Article 27.2 of the PSC which provides that the title to crude oil and/or Gas to which
each constituent of the Contractor is entitled to under the contract, and the crude oil and/or gas sold
to Government or its nominee by the constituents of the Contractor shall pass to the relevant Party,
or as the case may be, to Government or its nominee at the Delivery Point. Contractor shall be
responsible for all costs and risks prior to the Delivery Point, and each Party shall be responsible for
all costs and risks associated with such Party's share after the Delivery Point. Where the
Government or its nominee purchases all or some of the Contractor's share of Crude Oil or
Condensate, the Government or its nominee shall be responsible for all costs and risks in respect of
the amount purchased, after the Delivery Point. On a conjoint reading of clause 21.5.13(c) read with
21.5.13(a)(iv) and Article 27.2, it is manifest that the intention of the parties is that the goods, viz.
Gas and Condensate, shall be separated, measured and recombined and then delivered at the
ONGC's Bassein-Hazira pipeline at which point the title of the goods also passes to the Government
or its nominee. Thus, the contract envisages delivery of goods as well as passing of title to the goods
at the Delivery Point. Having regard to the nature of goods which cannot be delivered like ordinary
goods, delivery of Natural Gas to GAIL is by injecting the Gas into the pipeline of the carrier ONGC,
which then emerges at ONGC's separation and sweetening facility at Hazira, where it is received by
GAIL which has its pipeline at that point. As noticed earlier, reference to GAIL in the PSC is not as
the nominee of the Government but as a recipient of the Gas which is injected into ONGC's pipeline.
The expression "deliver" and "receive" may be synonymous as contended by Mr. Shelat for the
respondent State Government. However, there is a distinction between the two expressions insofar
as delivery and receipt of Gas is concerned, inasmuch as, the Gas which is delivered at one point is
by the very nature of things received at another point.
36. According to the respondents, appropriation does not take place at the Delivery Point mentioned
in Article 21.5.13 (a)(iv), because at that stage the goods, viz. Natural Gas, was not in a usable
condition and that it was made fit for use only after it was subjected to processing at ONGC's
separation and sweetening facilities at Hazira. It has been vehemently contended on behalf of GAIL
that what GAIL had agreed to purchase was sweetened Gas and that the parties had agreed that the
same would be received by GAIL at Hazira downstream. That sweetening is a duty imposed on the
Contractor and not the Union of India or GAIL. The cost of operating the sweetening facilities has to
be borne by the Contractor and since what was contracted to be received by them was sweetened
Gas they would not assent if any other Gas is delivered to them. Therefore, there was no assent to
delivery of Gas at the Delivery Point prior to its sweetening. According to the learned counsel for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 64B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
GAIL, irrespective of the fact whether sweetened gas and sour gas are different commodities or not
under the Sales Tax Act and irrespective of the fact as to whether sweetening of gas amounts to
manufacture or not, what is agreed to be sold is sweetened gas and consequently the sale of such
goods would be deemed to take place at the time of their appropriation to the contract of same by
the seller or the buyer. Such appropriation would be feasible only when the goods as agreed to be
sold come into existence, which is possible only after sweetening. Thus, the appropriation takes
place post sweetening. It has been submitted that the appropriation of future goods would only take
place when the goods are complete and ready for delivery. Therefore, in view of section 4(2)(b) of
the CST Act, sale of Gas is deemed to take place inside Gujarat and consequently, such sale is liable
to sales tax under GST Act. Reliance has been placed on Article 21.3 of the PSC which says that for
the purpose of sale to the domestic market, the Delivery Point shall be the Delivery Point set forth in
the gas sales contract entered into by the Contractor to submit that the PSC itself envisages a
Delivery Point other than the Delivery Point mentioned therein and that clause 3 of the ISPA
contemplates delivery of Gas to the buyer at downstream of separation and sweetening facilities
owned and operated by ONGC at Hazira. Therefore, when a different delivery point is provided for
in the ISPA, which is the agreement between the Contractor and GAIL, it is that delivery point which
would prevail over the general provisions of the PSC.
37. In the aforesaid backdrop, what arises for determination is as to what were the goods that the
parties had agreed to buy and sell and where were the goods required to be delivered. In this regard
on reading the PSC as well as the ISPA in their entirety, it can be seen that there is no reference to
sweetened gas or for that matter sour gas in either of the two agreements. Reference is made to the
goods as Natural Gas, ANG and NANG and Condensate. The contention that what was agreed upon
was sweetened gas is based upon the fact that in the PSC, the parties have acknowledged that GAIL
would receive the Gas at the downstream of ONGC's Separation and Sweetening facilities and in
clause 3 of ISPA, it is provided that the Buyer shall pay to the Sellers at the rate of 90% of gas price
specified in Article 21.5.13(d) of the PSC for the net MMBtu of gas delivered at the downstream of
ONGC processing facility at Hazira (on account basis as directed by the Ministry of Petroleum and
Natural Gas). The payment shall be made by the Buyer within thirty days after receipt of each
monthly invoice from sellers to be raised on the basis of quantity of gas delivered to the buyer at
downstream of separation and sweetening facilities owned and operated by ONGC at Hazira as
certified by ONGC.
38. To understand the intent of the parties, both the contracts, viz., the PSC as well as the ISPA have
to be read together. Article 21.3 provides that for the purpose of sales to the domestic market
pursuant to Article 21, the Delivery Point shall be the Delivery Point set forth in the Gas sales
contract entered into by the Contractor. In the opinion of this court, in the first place, sale to GAIL
as nominee of the Government of India cannot be said to be a sale to the domestic market, because,
the domestic market would include several players, whereas here the gas is sold to GAIL as a
nominee of the Government of India. Therefore, insofar as sale of Gas to the Government of India or
its nominee is concerned, the same is governed by the PSC and the ISPA read together. Accordingly,
the Delivery Point would be the Delivery Point as envisaged under the PSC, else, the said expression
would be rendered redundant. Examining the case from another angle, assuming for the sake of
argument that sale of Natural Gas to GAIL as nominee of the Government of India is a sale to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 65B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
domestic market; in that case, the Delivery Point has to be such as set forth in the Gas Sales
Contract. It may, therefore, be apposite to refer to contents of the ISPA. Under the heading 'Recitals'
it has been stated that the Government of India and Sellers are parties to that certain Production
Sharing Contract dated 22nd December, 1994, with regard to Panna and Mukta fields. The PSC
provides for sale of natural gas by Sellers to GOI or a nominee of GOI. GAIL having been nominated
by the Government of India to purchase gas sold pursuant to the PSC is therefore the Buyer. The
Seller claims to have potential of 50 MMSCFD of natural gas available from wells covered by the
PSC and they informed the Buyer that they are now ready to supply gas for utilization by consumers
of the Buyer. The Buyer and Sellers desire to enter into an Interim Sales and Purchase Agreement
providing for gas sales during the pendency of such negotiations, without prejudice of any kind in
relation to their respective positions.
39. Various clauses have been set out under the heading "Agreement", which to the extent the same
are relevant for the present purpose read thus:
"1. Agreement to Purchase and Sell: Sellers agree to sell, and the Buyer agrees to
purchase natural gas from Sellers for the period and upon the terms set forth herein.
2. Term: This Agreement shall be and remain in effect until 1st June 1998, unless
mutually extended in writing by all parties to the Agreement.
3. Price: The Buyer shall pay to Seller at the rate of 90% of Gas price specified in
Article 21.5.13(d) of the PSC for the net MMBtu of gas delivered at the downstream of
ONGC processing facility at Hazira (on account basis as directed by the Ministry to
Petroleum and Gas). The payment shall be made by the Buyer within thirty days after
receipt of each monthly invoice from Sellers to be raised on the basis of quantity of
gas delivered to the buyer at downstream of separation and sweetening facilities
owned and operated by ONGC as certified by ONGC.
4. Sales Tax: The Buyer shall pay any and all sales tax pay- able on the sale of gas, in
addition to the price of gas.
5. Good Faith Negotiations: xxxx
6. Law and Resolution of Disputes: xxx
7. Neither the signing of the agreement or any action taken with regard hereto shall
(i) create a precedent with respect to the rights or obligations of the parties, (ii) be
deemed an admission by any party as to the proper inter- pretation of the PSC or the
rights and obligations of any party thereunder, or (iii) be a waiver of any rights of a
party under the PSC."
40. From the recitals contained in the ISPA, it is manifest that the contract is for sale and purchase
of natural gas to GAIL as nominee of the Government of India. Under the terms of the agreement
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 66B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
(ISPA) the Sellers have agreed to sell and the Buyer has agreed to purchase natural gas for the
period and upon the terms set forth therein. The period is specified in clause 2. The terms set forth
are in respect of price of gas, liability to pay the sales tax, to continue negotiations in good faith, to
resolve disputes in accordance with the laws in India, mutually by the parties, failing which to refer
the matter to arbitration, and signing of the agreement shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any
rights of a party under the PSC. On a reading of the ISPA in its entirety, there is no reference to any
Delivery Point therein. On behalf of the respondents, reliance has been placed upon the price clause
in the agreement, viz. clause 3 of ISPA for the purpose of contending that in terms thereof, the Buyer
has to pay to the Seller price on the basis of gas delivered at the downstream of ONGC processing
facility at Hazira and that the monthly invoice has to be raised on the basis of the quantity of gas
delivered to the buyer at downstream of separation and sweetening facilities owned and operated by
ONGC, and hence the delivery point in terms of the ISPA is downstream ONGC's sweetening and
separation facilities and that the gas delivered downstream of such facility would be sweetened gas
and hence, the parties have agreed to sell and purchase sweetened gas.
41. As noted earlier, the PSC as well as the ISPA have to be read together to understand the true
intent of the parties and not the stand of the respective parties. Both, the Government of India as
well as GAIL have stated that what was agreed between the parties was sale and purchase of
sweetened gas and that the delivery point is downstream of ONGC's sweetening and separation
facilities at Hazira and that unless sweetened gas was delivered, GAIL would not have assented to
accept the same and hence, there is no question of appropriation of natural gas to the contract
unless the same is delivered as sweetened gas. It may be noted at this stage that, the Supreme Court
in Reliance Natural Resources Limited v. Reliance Industries Limited (supra) was dealing with a
different question, however, the same involved a Product Sharing Contract which had been entered
into between the Government of India and the contractor and a contract of supply of gas between
RIL and RNRL. The court observed that the PSC overrides any other contract which may be entered
into for the supply of gas. A perusal of the clauses contained in Article 21.5.13 of the PSC shows that
under clause (b) thereof, the Seller has agreed to produce and deliver on a daily basis to the Buyer
100% of the Deliverability of ANG and NANG and Condensate at the Delivery Point, and the Buyer
has agreed to take and purchase, on a daily basis, 100% of the Deliverability of ANG and NANG and
Condensate so delivered. Thus, under the PSC the parties have agreed that 100% Deliverability of
ANG and NANG and Condensate has to be produced and delivered by the Seller at the Delivery
Point and correspondingly, the Buyer shall take and purchase the ANG and NANG and Condensate
so delivered. Buyer under the PSC means Government of India or its nominee. Therefore, GAIL as
nominee of the Government of India, steps into its shoes as Buyer and accordingly, is governed by
the terms of clause (b) of Article 21.5.13 of the PSC has to take and purchase 100% of the
Deliverability of natural gas as agreed under the ISPA at the Delivery Point. For the purposes of
Article 21.5.13, "Delivery Point" means the upstream weld at the underwater connection between
Sellers' pipeline and ONGC's underwater Gas transmission line or lines which transport Gas from
Bassein Field to the Hazira area. Therefore, on a conjoint reading of the PSC and the ISPA, what was
agreed to be sold and purchased was Natural Gas which was to be delivered at the Delivery Point as
defined under clause (a)(iv) of Article 21.5.13. In terms of clause (c) of Article 21.5.13, the gas and
condensate are separated into Gas and Condensate and measured separately and then recombined
and delivered at the Delivery Point. In the opinion of this court, having regard to the fact that what
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 67B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
is agreed to be sold and purchased by the parties is natural gas, the goods, viz. natural gas becomes
ascertained goods upon their production. These ascertained goods are thereafter separated and
measured at the offshore processing facility in terms of clause (c) of Article 21.5.13 of the PSC at
which point of them they are appropriated to the contract, whereafter they are delivered by the
Contractor at the Delivery Point, as contemplated under clause (a)(iv) of Article 21.5.13 of the PSC,
namely the upstream weld at the underwater connection between the Sellers' pipeline and ONGC's
underwater Gas transmission line or lines which transport Gas from Bassein Field to Hazira area.
Thus, the ascertained goods are appropriated to the contract at the offshore processing facility and
delivered at ONGC's pipeline at the T-Junction which is also beyond the territory of India. Thus,
ONGC takes delivery of the Natural Gas on behalf of GAIL and transports the Natural Gas mixed
with its other gas to Hazira, where GAIL receives the same in its pipeline post sweetening.
Additionally, in terms of Article 27.2 of the PSC, the title in the goods also passes to the Buyer at the
Delivery Point.
42. With a view to test the contention of the respondents, it would be necessary to examine the
recitals contained in the ISPA to ascertain whether the parties have agreed anything to the contrary.
On a plain reading of the ISPA, the relevant part whereof has been reproduced hereinabove, it is
abundantly clear that the same does not provide for any delivery point, nor is there even a whisper
about sweetened gas. The entire fulcrum of the respondents' case hinges upon the price clause as
contained in the ISPA for contending that the delivery point is downstream of ONGC's sweetening
and separation facilities at Hazira and that, therefore, what GAIL had agreed to purchase was
sweetened gas. In the opinion of this court, clause 3 of the ISPA is merely a price clause and just
because it provides for payment of the price based on the net MMBtu of gas delivered at
downstream of ONGC processing facility at Hazira and the invoice is to be raised on the basis of
quantity of gas delivered to the buyer at downstream and sweetening facilities owned and operated
by ONGC at Hazira, it cannot be so construed as to override the specific provisions of the PSC which
provide for delivery of the Natural Gas at the Delivery Point. Much emphasis is also laid on clause
(e) of Article 21.5.13 of the PSC whereby the parties have acknowledged that Gas is to be received by
GAIL at Hazira downstream of separation and sweetening facilities owned and operated by ONGC,
to contend that even under the PSC it was agreed that GAIL would receive the gas at Hazira which is
the delivery point. As noticed earlier, GAIL was not a party to the PSC and reference to GAIL in the
PSC is as a carrier and not as the nominee of the Government of India. In the opinion of this court,
the parties have intentionally employed the term "received" and not "delivered" in clause (e)
inasmuch as, as noticed earlier, having regard to the nature of the goods, viz. Natural Gas, the same
cannot be delivered like ordinary goods and can be delivered only through a gas pipeline. Therefore,
once the gas is appropriated and delivered at the Delivery Point as defined in Article 21.5.13 (a)(iv)
of the PSC, namely at the offshore T-Junction, it can only be received downstream of ONGC's
sweetening and separation facilities at Hazira along with all the other gas in the pipeline. Therefore,
the natural gas which is delivered at the T-Junction, when it is received at Hazira by GAIL, would be
in the form of sweetened gas as the same along with all other gas would undergo the process of
sweetening. Besides, as submitted by the petitioners, since it was not feasible to set up sweetening
and separation facilities offshore, though gas was to be delivered at the Delivery Point, viz. the
offshore T-Junction and the property in goods passed at the T-Junction, it was agreed that the
sweetening process was to be carried out at ONGC's facility at Hazira. Therefore, the gas after being
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 68B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
measured and set apart at the offshore processing facility stands delivered at the Delivery Point as
provided under sub-clause (iii) of clause (a) of Article 21.5.13 of the PSC, viz. at the upstream weld at
the underwater connection between Seller's pipeline and ONGC's underwater Gas transmission line
or lines which transport Gas from the Bassein Field to Hazira also known as the Offshore T-Junction
and the title to the goods also passes at the T-Junction and post appropriation, in terms of the PSC,
the goods, viz. Natural Gas so appropriated, is taken to the ONGC's sweetening and separation
facility at Hazira and after sweetening, it is received by GAIL at Hazira. Thus, the act of sweetening
being post appropriation, after the goods are delivered and the title has passed to the Buyer outside
the State of Gujarat, it cannot be said that the sale of goods has taken place within the State of
Gujarat merely because, post appropriation, the goods are subjected to some process within the
State of Gujarat.
43. In other words, the parties agreed to sell and purchase Natural Gas and there is no express or
implied agreement to purchase sweetened Gas. The Natural Gas, which is in the nature of
ascertained goods, is appropriated to the contract when it is separated and measured at the Offshore
Processing Facility and is thereafter delivered at the Delivery Point, viz. the Offshore T-Junction and
the title to the goods also passes there. Thus, appropriation, delivery and passing of title of the goods
all take place Offshore, outside the State of Gujarat. Indubitably, under the Sales Tax Act, it is the
situs of the goods at the time of their appropriation to the contract which is relevant and not the
passing of property, nonetheless, in the present case apart from the fact that the goods were
appropriated to the contract at the Offshore Processing Facility and delivered at the Delivery Point,
viz. the Offshore T-Junction, the title to the goods also passed to the Buyer at the Delivery Point and
the risk in the goods passed on to the Buyer, namely GAIL as nominee of the Government of India.
In the opinion of this court, once the goods are appropriated to the contract and delivered at the
Delivery Point outside the State of Gujarat, merely because the same undergo a process of
sweetening having regard to the nature of the goods, it cannot be said that the goods were
appropriated to the contract only post sweetening as is sought to be contended on behalf of the
respondents.
44. Another aspect of the matter is that the reference to the goods in the PSC as well as in the ISPA
is to Natural Gas/Gas. In the price clause, the expression used is "Natural Gas" and "Gas". Similarly,
in the sales tax clause, the expression used is "Gas" and in the clause regarding agreement to
purchase and sale, the expression used is "Natural Gas". The ISPA does not define the expressions
"Gas" or "Natural Gas". "Gas" is defined under Article 1.46 of the PSC to mean "Natural Gas".
"Natural Gas" is defined under Article 1.54 of the PSC to mean Wet Gas, Dry Gas, all other gaseous
hydrocarbons, and all substances contained therein, including Sulphur and Helium, which are
produced from oil or gas wells, excluding those condensed or extracted liquid hydrocarbons that are
liquefied at natural temperature and pressure conditions, and include the residue gas remaining
after the condensation or extraction of liquid hydrocarbons from gas. Therefore, reference to "Gas"
or "Natural Gas" in the PSC and the ISPA have to be attributed the meaning as contained in the
above definitions. The contention that the parties agreed to sell and purchase sweetened gas,
therefore, is not reflected from the agreements. The mere fact that in the price clause contained in
the ISPA, the buyer is required to pay to the sellers 90% of the cost price of gas specified in Article
21.5.13(d) of the PSC for the net MMBTU of gas delivered at the downstream of ONGC's processing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 69B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
facility at Hazira, does not mean that the parties had agreed to sell and purchase sweetened gas. As
discussed hereinabove, the gas which is injected at the T-Junction can be received by GAIL only at
downstream of ONGC's processing facility at Hazira and hence, there is no option but for the gas to
undergo processing at Hazira. The mere fact that the gas which is delivered at the T- Junction
undergoes certain processing at ONGC's sweetening and separating facility at Hazira would not
detract from the fact that the gas was appropriated to the contract at the offshore Processing Facility
and delivered at the delivery point as envisaged in Article 21.5.13(a)(iv) of the PSC.
45. This court is of the view that merely because the sellers have decided to charge on the basis of
what is ultimately received by the Buyer cannot be determinative of the fact as to where the sale
takes place. The price clause contained in the ISPA is only a mechanism by which the parties have
decided the price of the goods and the same cannot decide the situs of the sale. Moreover, the ISPA
cannot be relegated to the status of an agreement modifying the PSC or superseding the PSC to the
extent of Delivery Point, inasmuch as, the ISPA is in continuation and not in derogation of the PSC.
Besides, in terms of Article 34.2 of the PSC, the contract cannot be amended, modified, varied or
supplemented in any respect except by an instrument in writing signed by all the parties, which shall
state the date upon which the amendment or modification shall become effective. Therefore, if at all
any term of the PSC is to be amended, modified or varied or supplemented, it is to be by way of an
instrument in writing signed by all the parties namely, the constituents of the Contractor and the
Government of India. The ISPA executed between the constituents of the Contractor and the GAIL,
therefore, cannot amend, modify, vary or supplement the PSC. Under the circumstances, the price
clause as contained in the ISPA which provides for payment at the rate of 90% of the Gas price
specified in Article 21.5.13(d) of the PSC for the net MMBtu of gas delivered at the downstream of
ONGC facility at Hazira, would not modify the principal agreement between the parties, namely that
the Gas is to be delivered at the Delivery Point as contemplated in clause (a)(iv) of Article 21.5.13 of
the PSC nor can the same be read to mean that the parties had agreed to sell and purchase
sweetened Gas.
4. Another contention which has been vehemently canvassed on behalf of the respondents is that the
Gas which is delivered at the Offshore T-Junction is co-mingled with other gases and hence, it
ceases to be ascertained. It is On-shore Hazira that the goods are ascertained, ascertainable or
deliverable as they are co-mingled with other gases. In this regard, it may be germane to refer to the
decision of the Allahabad High Court (Lucknow Bench) in Reliance Industries Limited v. State of
U.P., 2012 (194) ECR 293 (Allahabad) wherein the assessment orders imposing tax had been
assailed on the ground of there being a jurisdictional error claiming that the transactions were
inter-state sales. The petitioner therein, entered into Gas Sales and Purchase Agreement (GSPA)
with its customers in different States, including the State of U.P. The gas was extracted from the sea
and brought to a place called Gadimoga in the State of Andhra Pradesh. At Gadimoga, the petitioner
delivered natural gas (lean gas) to its different customers through a meter installed there to measure
the quality and quantity of gas supplied to the buyers. It was the case of the petitioner that delivery
point of natural gas to the purchaser is the outlet flange of the petitioner's delivery facility located at
the onshore processing terminal of the Gas Field at Gadimoga of Andhra Pradesh. It was further the
case of the petitioner that in respect of the sale of lean gas by the petitioner to the purchaser through
transporter, with regard to taxability as a result of commingling of gas or the title of the gas being
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 70B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
transferred at the delivery point itself, the petitioner shall not be answerable to any alleged "post
sale" processing of gas. It was contended on behalf of the State that transportation of gas in common
pipeline belongs to different buyers, hence, it becomes unascertained goods and as such, the sale
shall be deemed to take place at Orai in the State of U.P. and not in Gadimoga of Andhra Pradesh. It
was further submitted that the gas of different buyers gets mixed with each other, becomes
unascertained goods and hence, it cannot be an incidence of inter-state sale. The gas while moving
in the common pipeline is in co-mingled form, hence it is not known as to which portion of gas
belongs to whom and thus, it becomes ascertained goods only at Orai at the delivery point where
appropriation takes place. The court observed that if the above argument advanced by the learned
counsel for the State of U.P. was to be accepted, then the seller or buyer of natural gas, who does not
possess his own pipeline, shall be prevented from transporting his gas and everyone would have to
install his own pipeline which is neither feasible nor practical. The court observed that
transportation of natural gas cannot be compared with transportation of tangible goods. Mixture of
natural gas of common quality during the course of transportation does not affect the right of the
buyer. Every buyer or shipper may draw its natural gas from the open access gas pipeline with due
measurement at exit point. The court noted that while transporting the gas from Hazira to onward
destination because of addition of natural gas of GAIL, it is subjected to processing and extracting of
some molecules to make it suitable for industrial consumption and then carried through spur
pipeline at the installation of the customers where again the processing or purification and removal
of raw materials is undertaken. The court observed that under section 3 of the CST Act read with
section 7 of the VAT Act, natural gas is delivered at delivery point and the quantity is ascertained
with due movement to forward destination situated outside the State, therefore, it is an inter-state
sale or trade. The court observed that in view of the statutory compulsion under the Petroleum and
Natural Gas Regulatory Board (Access Code For Common Carrier Or Contract Carrier Natural Gas
Pipelines) Regulations, 2008 and Notification dated 20th December, 2006 issued by the
Government of India laying down the policy of natural gas pipeline, the change of the nature of gas
during movement or by the processing to some extent, that too, outside the State of U.P., does not
seem to change the nature of sale in pursuance of inter-state trade. On the question of situs of sale, it
was contended on behalf of the State that the situs of sale shall be at the receding end of the gas
pipeline, that is, Orai because of alleged change in quantity of gas and payment of cost after delivery
at the buyer's end. The court placed reliance upon the decision of the Constitution Bench of the
Supreme Court in 20th Century Finance Corporation Limited v. State of Maharashtra, (2000) 6 SCC
12, wherein the court examined the power of the State Legislature under Entry 54 of List II and held
that State Legislature cannot by law, treat sales outside the State and sales in the course of import as
"sales within the State" by fixing the situs of sales within the State since it is within the exclusive
domain of the appropriate legislature, that is, the Parliament. The Allahabad High Court in the facts
of the case before it, held that the situs of sale shall be at Gadimoga where the property of goods
passes to the buyer's realm. The court held that in terms of the GSPA and GTA, the lean gas passes
to the buyer in terms of GSPA and sale consideration at Gadimoga and not at Orai in the State of
U.P. Hence, the situs of sale shall be Gadimoga and not Orai in the State of U.P. The court further
observed that though the Sale of Goods Act regulates the contractual obligations but when the
question relates to inter-State sale, then primacy should be given to the construction of different
provisions of the Central Sales Tax Act and not the Sale of Goods Act. CST Act is a special enactment
to regulate the inter-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 71B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
State sale whereas the Sale of Goods Act is the general law. On the question as to whether the
Natural Gas supplied to shipper (buyer) was unascertained, the court observed that in view of the
nature and definition of gas, whenever Lean or Natural Gas is transported through a container or
pipeline, it shall occupy the whole of its space irrespective of its quantity. Accordingly, supply of
natural gas to two or more buyers or shippers shall always be in commingled form. On behalf of the
State, it was contended that the gas pipeline possessing the gas of different customers is passed on
in co-mingled form, hence, it is unascertained goods. The court observed that the factual matrix
with regard to transportation of gas in co-mingled form was not disputed. The court held that the
movement of gas on common carrier basis under the open access system because of statutory
compulsion does not make the shipper's gas unascertained. The court referred to the international
practice in the book dealing with Sale and Gas Transport Agreement Principle and Practice (Third
Edition) written by Peter Roberts and observed that the delivery point shall be the point at which
title, custody and risk or loss of damage of gas transfers from seller to buyer. The court referred to
the following observations made by the author with regard to transfer of title:-
"The delivery point will ordinarily be the point at which title to, custody of and the
risk of loss of or damage to the gas (or LNG) transfers from the seller to the buyer.
The delivery point will also often be determinative in the allocation of tax liabilities
between the parties (40-017). Modern contracts and commercial codes have
successfully separated provisions for the transfer of custody, title and risk in
arrangements for the sale of goods, such that these components can be considered
and applied individually. The GSA (or SPA) might seek to exclude certain implied
conditions which would otherwise apply to define the transfers of title, custody and
risk under GSA (or SPA). The GSA (or SPA) might also set up a regime whereby the
seller indemnifies the buyer for claims and liabilities associated with the gas (or LNG)
prior to the transfer of title and the buyer indemnifies the seller for claims and
liabilities after the transfer of title.
In a cross-border pipeline gas sale, where the delivery point is within the buyer's
territory and the seller has to transport the gas to that delivery point, a formulation
which is sometimes used is one where title to the gas will pass to the buyer at a
defined border point and risk of loss of or damage to (and custody of) the gas will
remain with the seller up to the delivery point:
The passing of title at the border point is intended to promote the suggestion that the
seller is exporting gas to (but is not conducting business within) the buyer's territory
and that the buyer (not the seller) is importing gas, which may be important to either
or both parties for tax reasons. That risk remains with the seller up to the delivery
point, rather than also transferring at the border point, is a commercial point for the
benefit of the buyer but it could jeopardise the intended operation of the earlier title
transfer."
In the light of the above international practice with regard to delivery point, the court held that
Gadimoga shall be the delivery point not only in terms of GSPA but in terms of international
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 72B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
practice and all rights and liabilities and risk shall be transferred to the shipper at Gadimoga. The
court, accordingly, held that keeping in view the recent technological development in the
measurement of gas and its supply, the Natural Gas supplied to buyers at Gadimoga may not be
termed as unascertained goods. The court referred to various decisions wherein the controversy
with regard to fungible goods and co-mingling of gas was subject matter of consideration. Reference
was made to Complete Auto Transit v. Brady, (1977) 430 US 274, wherein it was held that as a
general rule, where fungible goods belonging to different persons are so intermingled as to be
undistinguishable, whether by consent of the owners or by someone's wrongful act, the owners
become tenants in common of the mass. The co-mingling of a fungible commodity does not affect
ownership unless the parties intend to transfer title. The way the system works, each shipper is
simply entitled to a volume of gas thermally equivalent to that which is placed into storage
regardless of where it was placed when stored or from where it is taken when removed from storage.
The court also made reference to the Canada Federal Court of Appeal decision in The Ministry of
Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (Canada) v. Tenaska Marketing Canada, 2007 FCA 223,
wherein the court held thus:-
"Due to its unique physical properties, large volumes of natural gas can only be
transported in a continuous stream. Once delivered into a pipeline for transportation,
it becomes commingled with other natural gas. Individual molecules are not
separately identifiable, and cannot be accurately tracked or traced. As a result,
natural gas is sold and purchased on a "quality and quantity basis", and treated as a
fungible goods, with title taken on a quality and quantity basis.
Accordingly, and at the ultimate point of delivery, what the purchaser would actually
receive is the same general volume and quality of natural gas (less any fuel consumed
in transport), and having the same effective heat content that was delivered at the
upstream point.
Pipeline transportation contracts generally provide for the commingling of the
natural gas delivered to the pipeline with other natural gas, and require specified
quality standards for natural gas being delivered to or by the pipeline.
Given the fundamental properties of natural gas (i.e., it is a fungible commodity,
commingled with the contents of the pipeline on delivery, and therefore not
separately identifiable once delivered), all of Tenaska's shipments of the Canadian
natural gas via the TCPL/GLGC Pipeline were commingled with like natural gas and
lost their separate identities once delivered to that pipeline. Furthermore, and when
transported through the U.S, the Canadian natural gas would likely have been further
commingled with U.S. produced natural gas, being delivered to the GLPS at various
points in the U.S. In the end, the change of ownership of the Canadian natural gas
during its transit through the U.S. and the commingling of Canadian and American
gas on the American part of the pipeline are not relevant to determine the purpose of
the delivery from one place in Canada to another place in Canada. These facts form
an intrinsic part of the economic reality of transporting natural gas via pipeline
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 73B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
through the United States. This economic reality was very much in the mind of the
drafter of the legislation and found its way in the terms used by Parliament."
47. From the submissions made on behalf of the petitioners as well as the averments made in the
memorandum of petition and the documents annexed therewith as well as from the above referred
decision of the Allahabad High Court, it is apparent that due to its unique physical properties, large
volumes of Natural Gas can only be transported in a continuous stream. Once delivered into a
pipeline for transportation, it becomes co-mingled with other natural gas. Individual molecules are
not separately identifiable and cannot be accurately tracked or traced. As a result, natural gas is sold
and purchased on a "quality and quantity basis", and treated as a fungible good, with title taken on a
quality and quantity basis. As discussed hereinabove, once the gas is injected at the ONGC's
off-shore pipeline, the same is received downstream of ONGC's sweetening and separation facilities
at Hazira. However, merely because the gas which is delivered at the Offshore T-Junction is
co-mingled with other gases, does not detract from the fact that prior thereto, the natural gas sold by
the seller to the buyer, was ascertained at the off-shore processing facility and appropriated to the
contract of sale and delivered at the Delivery Point. The subsequent sweetening of the gas post
appropriation, does not change the situs of the sale in terms of clause (b) of section 4(2) of the CST
Act, in view of the fact that the situs of the sale is at the offshore Processing Facility where the
ascertained goods were separated and measured and appropriated to the contract and delivered to
the buyer at the Delivery Point, where the title of the goods also stood transferred to the buyer in
terms of Article 27.2 of the PSC. Under the circumstances, the appropriation of goods has taken
place at the off-shore processing facility and the goods are delivered at the Delivery Point namely, at
the upstream weld at the underwater connection between the Seller's pipeline and ONGC's
underwater Gas transmission line which transport Gas from the Bassein Field to the Hazira area,
that is, outside the State of Gujarat. Once it is held that the sale is not within the State of Gujarat, as
a natural sequitur thereto, the State of Gujarat is not authorised or empowered to levy sales tax on
such transaction.
48. As noticed earlier, it has been alternatively contended on behalf of the petitioners that if at all
the sale is held to be not outside the State of Gujarat, the sale has taken place in the course of import
of the goods into the territory of India, inasmuch as, the goods are imported from off-shore
Panna-Mukta oil fields which are not situated within the territory of India and hence, the sale of
goods is in the course of import of goods into the territory of India and therefore also, the provisions
of the GST Act would not be attracted.
49. In the context of the controversy as to whether the sale of goods has taken place in the course of
import, the learned counsel for the respective parties have placed reliance upon the decision of the
Supreme Court in the case of Aban Lloyd Chiles Offshore Limited and Another v. Union of India
(supra), the decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of Pride Foramer v. Union of India
(supra), the decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of Commissioner of Sales Tax,
Maharashtra State, Mumbai v. Pure Helium (India) Limited (supra) and the decision of a Division
Bench of this court in the case of Larsen & Toubro Limited v. Union of India (supra). For the
purpose of appreciating the controversy in issue, it may be germane to refer to the above decisions.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 74B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
49.1 In Pride Foramer v. Union of India (supra), the Bombay High Court was considering a case
where the levy of customs duty on goods imported by the petitioner for being transhipped for their
use as spares and stores at the Oil Rig which carried on operation in designated areas of the country
as defined under the Act with the Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic Zone
and Other Maritime Zones Act, 1976 had been called in question. The petitioner company was
importing goods including stores, spares, consumables and other articles required for use on the Oil
Rig. As such imported goods/stores could not land directly on the Oil Rig, the same landed at
Mumbai seaport/airport and were then transshipped to the Oil Rig. The respondents refused to
permit the petitioner to transship stores and equipments to the Oil Rig without payment of customs
duty. The petitioner contended that the goods imported for Oil Rig are liable to be transshipped to
the Oil Rig without levy of duty of customs and that the respondents were wrongfully levying duty of
customs on the goods which were used on the Oil Rig. The court took into consideration
notifications dated 18th July, 1986 and 19th September, 1996 issued under the Maritime Zones Act,
1976 whereby the Customs Act, 1962 and Customs Tariff Act, 1975 had been extended to the
designated areas in the Continental Shelf and Exclusive Economic Zone of India as declared by the
notification of the Government of India in the Ministry of External Affairs No. SO 643(E) dated 19th
September, 1996 with immediate effect. The court after referring to the provisions of sections 7(1)
and 7(7) along with sections 3, 6 and 7 of the Maritime Zones Act, held that if the area of the
exclusive economic zone or continental shelf where the rigs were stationed (of course outside
territorial waters) is deemed to be a part of the territory of India under the Central Government
notifications issued pursuant to the provisions of the Territorial Waters Act, then the supply of
imported spares or goods or equipments to the rigs by a ship will attract import duty and ship
employed for transshipment of goods for that purpose would not be a foreign going vessel under
section 2(21) of the Customs Act since the area of discharge or unloading/loading is within India by
virtue of the deeming provisions of sections 6 and 7 and consequent explanations of the Maritime
Zones Act. The court, accordingly, held that the respondents were justified in refusing to permit the
petitioner to clear, ship stores and spares for use on the Oil Rig, on transhipment permit and
without payment of customs duty while the Oil Rig is in the designated area. The court also held that
the continental shelf land, the exclusive economic zone are parts of India in view of the provisions of
section 6(6) and section 7(7) of the Maritime Zones Act and for the purposes thereof and pursuant
to the notifications referred to therein, the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962 were extended to
such areas, consequently the Oil Rigs, proceeding to such areas or operating therein are not foreign
going vessels under section 2(21) of the Customs Act and, therefore, the petitioner was not entitled
to the benefit of section 53 read with section 54 and/or of section 86 read with section 87 of the
Customs Act.
49.2 In Aban Lloyd Chiles Offshore Limited v. Union of India (supra), the issue which had fallen for
consideration by the Supreme Court was whether the oil rigs engaged in operations in the exclusive
economic zone/continental shelf of India, falling outside the territorial waters of India are 'foreign
going vessels' as defined by section 2(21) of the Customs Act, 1962, and are entitled to consume
imported stores thereon without payment of customs duty in terms of section 87 of the Customs Act,
1962? The court affirmed the view adopted by the Bombay High Court in Pride Foramer (supra) and
held thus:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 75B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
"73. A combined reading of Sections 3, 6 and 7 of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976 shows
that territorial waters, the seabed and sub-soil underlying therein and the air space
over such territorial waters form part of the territory of India. Sovereignty of India
extends over the territorial waters but the position is different in the case of
continental shelf and exclusive economic zone of India. The continental shelf of India
comprises of the seabed beyond the territorial waters to a distance of 200 nautical
miles. The exclusive economic zone represents the sea or waters over that continental
shelf.
74. From the reading of Sections 6 and 7 of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976, it is clear
that in respect of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone, India has been
given only certain limited sovereign rights and such limited sovereign rights
conferred on India in respect of continental shelf and exclusive economic zone cannot
be equated to extending the sovereignty of India over the continental shelf and
exclusive economic zone as in the case of territorial waters. Sub-section (6) of Section
6 and sub-section (7) of Section 7 of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976 empower the
Central Government by notification to extend any enactment in force in India with
such restrictions and modifications which it thinks fit to the continental shelf and the
exclusive economic zone and. further provides that an enactment so extended shall
have effect as if the continental shelf or the exclusive economic zone to which the
enactment has been extended is a part of the territory of India. Thus, sub- section (6)
of Section 6 and sub-section (7) of Section 7 create a fiction by which the continental
shelf and the exclusive economic zone are deemed to be a part of India for the
purposes of such enactments which are extended to those areas by the Central
Government by issuing a notification.
In exercise of the powers vested in the Central Government under sub-section (6) of
Section 6 and sub- section (7) of Section 7 of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976, the
Government extended the Customs Act, 1962 and the Customs Tariff Act, 1976 to the
designated areas of the continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone by
notification published in the Official Gazette referred to and reproduced in
paragraphs 29 to 32.
97. The combined effect of these notifications is to extend the application of the
Customs Act and the Customs Tariff Act to the aforesaid areas declared as
"designated areas" under the Maritime Zones Act, 1976. The further effect of these
notifications is that the designated areas of the continental shelf and the exclusive
economic zone become a part of the territory of India for limited purposes. The
natural consequence of such declarations and the extension of the Customs Act and
the Customs Tariff Act to these designated areas is to introduce the customs regime
to such areas resulting in the levy and collection of customs duties on goods imported
into these areas as if these areas are a part of the territory of India. In these
circumstances, the definition of "India" as given in Section 2(27) of the Customs Act
gets extended by these provisions to cover areas declared as designated areas beyond
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 76B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
the territorial waters and located the continental shelf and the exclusive economic
zone of India. If one reads the Customs Act without reading the Maritime Zones Act,
1976, then the oil rig located in the notified areas/designated areas constitute "place
outside India". On the other hand, the very purpose of Sections 5, 6 and 7 of the
Maritime Zones Act, 1976 is to declare an area of the contiguous zone/continental
shelf/exclusive economic zone as a designated area so that exploration, exploitation
and protection of resources belonging to India could be carried out. Under the said
Act, the Central Government can create artificial island, offshore terminals, etc. By
the said Act, customs and other fiscal enactments have been extended. Therefore, the
object is very clear that the revenue generated from exploration and exploitation
should accrue to the coastal State viz. India."
49.3 In Commissioner of Sales Tax, Maharashtra State, Mumbai v. Pure Helium (India) Limited
(supra), the Bombay High Court was dealing with the question as to whether Mumbai High is a
foreign destination and whether the sales of helium gas by the respondent to its vendee situated in
the Mumbai High region are sales in the course of export out of India as contemplated by section
5(1) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. The assessee claimed that the sales which were effected were
sales in the course of export under section 5(1) of the CST Act for the reason that Mumbai High falls
beyond the territorial waters of India. The case of the assessee, therefore, was that the sales had
occasioned the export of goods to a place outside the territory of India. The assessing authority,
however, had held that Mumbai High was a part of the territory of India and that the sales had
occasioned inter- State movement of goods. The submission of the Revenue was that article 366 (3)
defines the expression "Union Territory" to mean Union Territory specified in the First Schedule
and to include any other territory comprised within the territory of India, but not specified in that
Schedule. The court found the submission fallacious because it proceeded on the basis that the
continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone are comprised within the territory of India. The
court held that section 6(6) and section 7(7) empower the Central Government to extend any
enactment for the time being in force in India to the continental shelf or the exclusive economic
zone, respectively. Upon being extended, the enactment is to have effect as if the continental shelf
or, as the case may be, the exclusive economic zone to which it has been extended is a part of the
territory of India. The words "as if" in sections 6(6) and 7(7) of the Maritime Zones Act bring into
existence a legal fiction. Under the legal fiction, the enactment which is extended has to have effect
as if the continental shelf or exclusive economic zone to which the enactment has been extended is
part of the territory of India. Consequently and for instance once the Customs Act, 1962 stands
extended to a designated area of the continental shelf, then the Act has to have effect as if the area of
the continental shelf forms part of the territory of India. The deeming fiction is for that purpose. On
behalf of the revenue, it was contended that the sale in the said case was an inter-State sale on the
ground that the sale was occasioned by a movement of goods from one State to another. The court
held that the continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone do not constitute a part of the
territory of India. As a matter of fact, it was in recognition of this position that section 6(6) and
section 7(7) of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976 empowered the Union Government to extend the
provisions of any enactment in force in India to a designated area or to the continental shelf or the
exclusive economic zone as if the territory to which it is extended is a part of the territory of India.
The court held that the movement of goods from the State of Maharashtra to Mumbai High does not
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 77B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
constitute a movement from one State to another State. Mumbai High does not form part of any
State in the Union of India. It was, accordingly, held that the basis on which the revenue sought to
assess the sale is an inter-State sale involving a movement of goods from the State of Maharashtra to
Mumbai High and was contrary to the mandate of the provisions of section 6 of the CST Act. On the
question as to whether Mumbai High was a foreign destination, and that the sale of helium gas by
the assessee to its vendee situated in the Mumbai High was a sale in the course of export out of India
as contemplated under section 5(1) of the CST Act, 1956, the court held that export of goods out of
the territory of India envisages the movement of goods across the customs frontier. The notion of
customs frontier is not alien to sub-section (1) of section 5. Once the customs frontier stands
extended to a territory, there can obviously be no export of goods to a territory which falls within the
customs frontier. An export of goods involved the movement of goods from within the customs
frontier to a point beyond. Contrariwise, the import of goods involves the movement of goods from a
point which lies outside the customs frontier to a point within. Sub-section (1) of section 5 also
recognises the intrinsic relevance of goods crossing the customs frontier in the case of an export, or
as the case may be, on import of goods. The court observed that the provisions of Customs Act, 1962
had been extended to designated areas of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone, the
effect whereof was to introduce the customs regime to such areas resulting in the levy and collection
of customs duty on goods imported into those areas as if they are part of the territory of India. The
court was of the view that the fiction which is enacted by the legislature is for the purposes of the
statutory design which the Legislature provides. Equally, a fiction which is created by legislation
must be taken to its logical conclusion. Once, the Union Government acting as a delegate of a
legislature has extended the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962 and the Customs Tariff Act, 1976 to
designated areas of the continental shelf or the exclusive economic zone, with effect from January
15, 1987, it would be impossible to hold that the movement of goods from within the territory of
India to that territory of the continental shelf or exclusive economic zone constitutes an export of
goods out of the territory of India. To hold that it would constitute an export would be to ignore the
extension of the customs frontier emanating as it does from the extension of the Customs Act, 1962
to the areas so designated. The court held that export for the purposes of section 5(1) of the CST Act,
1956 cannot have a meaning which is divorced from the applicability of the Customs Act, 1962 to a
territory in pursuance of a notification issued in exercise of the powers conferred upon the Union
Government in the Maritime Zones Act, 1976.
49.4 In Larsen & Toubro Limited v. Union of India (supra), this High Court was considering a case
where the authority of the respondents to demand and levy any sales tax under the CST Act with
respect to the sale transactions between the petitioners and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, which
sales had taken place at Bombay High was subject matter of challenge. The court looked into the
question as to whether Bombay High which is situated in the exclusive economic zone is part of the
territory of India. The court observed that under section 3 of the CST Act, the sale and purchase of
goods is deemed to take place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce if the sale and purchase
occasions movement of goods from one State to another. It was, therefore, necessary to ascertain
whether the sale in question occasioned the movement of goods from one State to another. For this
purpose, the court found it necessary to ascertain whether the movement of goods from Hazira to
Bombay High can be stated to be a movement of goods from the State of Gujarat to another State
within the country. The court referred to various provisions of the Maritime Zones Act and held
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 78B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
thus:-
"34. From the above provisions it can clearly be seen that though Union of India has
certain rights over the Exclusive Economic Zone, the Indian Union does not have
sovereignty over such an region. Clause (a) to sub- Section (7) of Section 7, for
example provides that the Union has, over the Exclusive Economic Zone, sovereign
rights for the purpose of exploration, exploitation, conservation and management of
the natural resources. Sovereign rights are thus for the limited purposes provided
therein.
Sub-Section (4) of Section 7 does not speak of unlimited sovereign rights much less
sovereignty of the Union of India over the exclusive economic zone. It is only by
virtue of the notification in Official Gazette that the Central Government may declare
any area of exclusive economic zone to be a designated area and make such provision
as it may deem necessary with respect to such area for different purposes including
for the purpose of customs and other fiscal matters in relation to such designated
area. Further sub-Section (7) of Section 7 empowers the Central Government to issue
notification to extend certain laws to any part of the exclusive economic zone and to
make such provisions as are necessary for enforcement of such enactments. It is
further provided that thereupon the enactments so extended shall have effect as if the
exclusive economic zone or the part thereof to which it has been extended is a part of
the territory of India. The language used in clause (b) of sub-Section (7) of Section 7
to the Maritime Zones Act is significant as it does not provide that the designated
area upon notification by the Union of India, shall be part of the territory of India. It
provides that law so notified shall be extended as if the exclusive economic zone or
the part thereof is a part of the territory of India. The language is clear and gives rise
to a deeming fiction for the limited purpose of extension and application of laws
notified and for that limited purpose Exclusive Economic Zone shall be deemed to be
a part of the territory of India. It is not the same thing as to suggest that Exclusive
Economic Zone becomes part of the territory of India. It is not even the case of the
respondents that the Exclusive Economic Zone is part of the territory of India as
provided in Article 1 of the Constitution of India. There is no claim of sovereignty
over such an area, it is sovereign rights which are extended to such area by virtue of
formation of Exclusive Economic Zone for the limited purposes envisaged under the
statute. By virtue of clause (b) of sub-Section (7) of Section 7 of the Maritime Zones
Act it becomes further clear that as and when Union of India issues notification
extending any enactment over the Exclusive Economic Zone or part thereof such
enactment extended is applicable as if the Exclusive Economic Zone or part thereof to
which it has been extended is a part of the territory of India.
35. In view of the above discussion, it clearly emerges that when the sale of goods
took place at Bombay High, for which the goods moved from Hazira to Bombay High,
such movement does not get covered within the expression "movement of goods from
one State to another" contained in clause (a) of Section 3 of CST Act. It is clear that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 79B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
the goods had not been moved from one State to another since, in our opinion,
Bombay High does not form part of any State of Union of India."
40. By a notification dated 27.2.2010 provisions of Chapter V of Finance Act, 1994 (pertaining to
Service Tax) have been extended to continental shelf and Exclusive Economic Zone as indicated for
the purposes specified in the notification. It can thus be seen that the Central Government has been
issuing notifications extending different taxing statutes to designated areas, continental shelf and
Exclusive Economic Zone. Such notifications have been issued extending the Income Tax Act, 1961,
Customs Act and the Customs Tariff Act, Central Excise Act and the Central Excise Tariff Act, the
Service Tax and the provisions contained in Finance Act, 1994. However, admittedly, no such
notification has been issued extending all or any of the provisions of CST Act to any of the
designated areas, continental shelf or Exclusive Economic Zone. To our mind in absence of such
notification, respondents could not have demanded tax under the CST Act from the petitioners on
its sale of machinery, parts etc. to the respondent No.5, which sale was completed at Bombay High.
42. The decision in the case of Aban Loyd Chiles Offshore Limited and another v. Union of India and
others (supra), thus clearly lays down principle of limited sovereign rights over continental shelf and
Exclusive Economic Zone regions and giving rise to a deeming fiction for the purpose of extension of
the laws by notification issued by the Central Government under Sections 6 and 7 of the Maritime
Zones Act. In the said case on extending the Customs Act and Central Excise Act, by virtue of
notifications, the Apex Court held that any movement of goods to such Exclusive Economic Zone
would not be an export and no export benefit can be availed on such supply. It was further held that
mineral oil produced in the exclusive economic zone and continental shelf will be chargeable to
Central Excise duty as goods produced in India.
In the present case, however, we are confronted with the situation where CST Act has not been
extended by issuance of notification by the Central Government to the continental shelf of the
exclusive economic zone."
50. On behalf of the respondents, strong reliance had been placed upon the decision of the Bombay
High Court in the case of Commissioner of Sales Tax v. Pure Helium (supra) for contending that
once the customs frontier has been extended to a territory, there can be no import from such
territory which falls within the customs frontier. The movement of goods from the Panna-Mukta oil
fields, therefore, cannot be said to be in the course of import of goods into the territory of India,
inasmuch as, Panna-Mukta oil fields also stand included within the designated area to which
provisions of the Customs Act have been extended. On behalf of the petitioners, strong reliance is
placed upon the decision of this court in the case of Larsen & Toubro Limited v. Union of India
(supra) for the purpose of contending that the court in the said case after considering the decision of
the Supreme Court in the case of Aban Lloyd Chiles Offshore Limited (supra) has observed that in
the said case on extending the Customs Act and Central Excise Act, by virtue of notifications, the
Apex Court held that any movement of goods to such exclusive economic zone would not be an
export and no export benefit can be availed on such supply. It was further held that mineral oil
produced in the exclusive economic zone and continental shelf would be chargeable to central excise
duty as goods produced in India. The court had observed that in the present case, it was, however,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 80B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
confronted with the situation where CST Act has not been extended by issuance of notification to the
Central Government to the continental shelf or exclusive economic zone. It has been contended on
behalf of the petitioners that there is a contradiction between the law laid down by this court in the
case of Larsen & Toubro Limited v. Union of India and by the Bombay High Court in the case of
Commissioner of Sales Tax v. Pure Helium (India) Limited, and that the decision in the case of
Larsen & Toubro Limited lays down the correct proposition of law.
51. The facts are not in dispute. Pursuant to the contract of sale, namely the PSC and the ISPA, there
has been a movement of goods from the Panna-Mukta oil fields to the State of Gujarat. The question
that, therefore, arises is whether the sale of goods is in the course of import of goods into the
territory of India. The Supreme Court in the case of Aban Lloyd Chiles Off-Shore Limited (supra)
has, after considering the provisions of the Maritime Zones Act and the notifications whereby the
provisions of the Customs Act and Customs Tariff Act have been extended to the designated areas
under the Maritime Zones Act, 1976, held that the definition of "India" as given in section 2(27) of
the Customs Act gets extended by these provisions to cover areas declared as designated areas
beyond the territorial waters and located in the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone of
India. The court held that if one reads the Customs Act without reading the Maritime Zones Act,
1976, then the oil rigs located in the notified areas/designated areas constitute "place outside India".
On the other hand, the very purpose of sections 5, 6 and 7 of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976 is to
declare an area of the contiguous zone/continental shelf/exclusive economic zone as a designated
area so that exploration, exploitation and protection of resources belonging to India could be carried
out. The court held that the area of exclusive economic zone/continental shelf where the oil rigs are
stationed (of course outside territorial waters) is deemed to be a part of the territory of India under
the Central Government notifications issued pursuant to the provisions of the Maritime Zones Act,
1976. It was further held that the supply of imported spares or goods or equipments to the rigs by a
ship will attract import duty and the ship employed for transhipment of goods for that purpose
would not be a foreign going vessel under section 2(21) of the Customs Act. The Customs Act stands
extended to the designated area by virtue of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976. The oil rig carrying on
operations in the designated area is not a foreign going vessel as the same would be deemed to be a
part of the Indian territory that is going from the territory of India to an area which is also deemed
to be a part of the territory of India. The above decision of the Supreme Court was rendered in the
context of the applicability of the provisions of the Customs Act to the designated area to which the
provisions of the Customs Act had been extended by virtue of the notification issued by the Central
Government. It is an admitted position that no notification has been issued by the Central
Government extending the applicability of the provisions of the Central Sales Tax Act to the
designated areas. Therefore, the provisions of the CST Act would not be applicable to the designated
areas. The question that, however, arises for consideration in the present case is whether the
movement of goods from Panna-Mukta oil fields into the State of Gujarat can be said to be in the
course of import of goods into the territory of India. Therefore, the central question that arises for
consideration is whether the Panna-Mukta oil fields can be stated to be outside the territory of India
as a result whereof, the sale can be said to be in the course of import of goods into the territory of
India.

52. It may be noted that while a specific contention has been raised by the petitioners in the
memorandum of petition that the Panna and Mukta oil/gas fields are located in the area of
Economic Zone as defined in the Maritime Zones Act; the location of the said oil/gas fields is beyond
the Territorial Waters of India; and since the Natural Gas has been imported by the Joint Venture
from the gas field to Hazira, no tax can be levied on such transaction in terms of Article 286 of the
Constitution, on behalf of the respondents nothing has been pleaded on the basis of the notifications
that find place in the above decisions to contend that by virtue of the deeming fiction, the
Panna-Mukta oil/gas fields stand included within the territory of India and therefore, the sale is not
in the course of import of goods into the territory of India. On behalf of the petitioners, it has been
contended that the statements and assertions regarding Customs frontiers having been extended to
the exclusive economic zone which are not supported by any pleadings and documents must be
disregarded. While it is true that the facts regarding issuance of the notifications which find
reference in the above decisions do not form part of the pleadings in the present case, nonetheless,
this court cannot be oblivious to the notifications which find reference in the above decisions.
Besides, on behalf of the petitioners it has not been asserted during the course of arguments that the
Panna- Mukta oil fields are not covered by the said notifications. From the above decisions, it is
clear that by Notification No.429(E) dated 18th July, 1986 the Central Government in exercise of
powers conferred by clause (a) of sub-section (5) of section 6 and clause (a) of sub-section (6) of
section 7 of the Maritime Zones Act, has declared the areas in the continental shelf or, as the case
may be, in the exclusive economic zone of India where the installations, structures and platforms,
the coordinates of which are given in the Schedule below the same, are situated and the areas
extending up to five hundred metres from the said installations, structures and platforms as
designated areas for the purposes of the said sections. As per Notification No. 11/87-CUSTOMS
dated 14th January, 1987, issued in exercise of powers conferred by clause (a) of sub- section (5) of
section 6 of and clause (a) of sub-section (6) of section 7 of the Maritime Zones Act, the provisions of
the Customs Act, 1962 were extended to the areas in the continental shelf and the exclusive
economic zones of India. By Notification No.S.O.643(E) dated 19th September, 1996, the Central
Government in exercise of powers conferred by clause
(a) of sub-section (5) of section 6 of and clause (a) of sub- section (6) of section 7 of the Maritime
Zones Act, has declared the areas in the continental shelf or, as the case may be, in the exclusive
economic zone of India where the installations, structures and platforms, the coordinates of which
are given in the Schedule below the same, are situated and the areas extending up to five hundred
metres from the said installations, structures and platforms as designated areas for the purposes of
the said sections. By Notification No. S.O. 189(E) issued on 11th February, 2002, the Central
Government in exercise of powers conferred by clause (a) of sub-section (5) of section 6 of and
clause (a) of sub-section (6) of section 7 of the Maritime Zones Act, extended the provisions of the
Customs Act, 1962 and Customs Tariff Act, 1975 to the continental shelf of India and the exclusive
economic zone of India for the purposes of:
(a) the prospecting for extraction of production of mineral oils in the continental
shelf of India or the exclusive economic zone of India, and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 82B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
(b) the supply of any goods as defined in clause (22) of section 2 of the Customs Act,
1962 in connection with any of the activities referred to in clause (a).
The Explanation thereto provides that for the purposes of that notification 'mineral oils' include
petroleum and natural gas.
53. The Supreme Court in Aban Lloyd Chiles Off- Shore Limited (supra), in the context of the above
notifications held thus:
"73. A combined reading of Sections 3, 6 and 7 of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976 shows
that territorial waters, the seabed and subsoil underlying therein and the air space
over such territorial waters form part of the territory of In- dia. Sovereignty of India
extends over the territorial waters but the position is different in the case of
continental shelf and exclusive economic zone of India. The continental shelf of India
comprises of the seabed beyond the territori- al waters to a distance of 200 nautical
miles. The exclusive economic zone represents the sea or waters over that con-
tinental shelf.
74. From the reading of Sections 6 and 7 of the Mari- time Zones Act, 1976, it is clear
that in respect of the con- tinental shelf and exclusive economic zone, India has been
given only certain limited sovereign rights and such lim- ited sovereign rights
conferred on India in respect of con- tinental shelf and exclusive economic zone
cannot be equated to extending the sovereignty of India over the continental shelf
and exclusive economic zone as in the case of territorial waters. Sub-section (6) of
Section 6 and sub-section (7) of Section 7 of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976 empower
the Central Government by notification to extend any enactment in force in India
with such restric- tions and modifications which it thinks fit to the continent- al shelf
and the exclusive economic zone and further provides that an enactment so extended
shall have effect as if the continental shelf or the exclusive economic zone to which
the enactment has been extended is a part of the territory of India. Thus, sub-section
(6) of Section 6 and sub-section (7) of Section 7 create a fiction by which the
continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone are deemed to be a part of India
for the purposes of such en- actments which are extended to those areas by the Cent-
ral Government by issuing a notification.
75. In exercise of the powers vested in the Central Gov- ernment under sub-section
(6) of Section 6 and sub-sec- tion (7) of Section 7 of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976, the
Government extended the Customs Act, 1962 and the Cus- toms Tariff Act, 1976 to
the designated areas of the contin- ental shelf and the exclusive economic zone by
notification published in the Official Gazette referred to and repro- duced in paras 29
to 32."
"85. Reading of Sections 6 and 7 of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976 makes it clear that
India's jurisdiction over the Maritime Zones Act, 1976 extends to the continental
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 83B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
shelf and exclusive economic zone. Consequently, if mineral oil is extracted or
produced in the exclusive economic zone or continental shelf and is brought to the
mainland, it will not be treated as import and, therefore, no customs duty would be
leviable. Likewise, goods supplied to a place in the exclusive economic zone or
continental shelf will not be treated as export under the Customs Act and no export
benefit can be availed on such supply. Any mineral oil pro- duced in the exclusive
economic zone or continental shelf will be chargeable to Central excise duty, as goods
pro- duced in India.
86. Implication of Notification No. S.O. 189(E) dated 7- 2-2002 and its consequences
have been clarified in Circu- lar No. 17 of 2002-Customs dated 13-3-2002 in
following terms:
"3. The implication of the said notification is that miner- al oils extracted or produced
in the EEZ and continental shelf of India if brought to the mainland shall not be
treated as import and therefore, no customs duty shall be leviable on such mineral
oils. Likewise, the goods supplied from the mainland to a place in EEZ or continental
shelf of India in connection with any activity related to mineral oil extraction or
production shall not be treated as export un- der the Customs Act, 1962 and
consequently, no export benefits can be availed of on such supplies. Another im-
plication of the said notification is that bringing of any goods from any other country
to any place in EEZ or con- tinental shelf of India in connection with any activity re-
lated to extraction or production of mineral oils shall be treated as import under the
Customs Act, 1962 and would be charged to duty accordingly. Further, mineral oils
pro- duced in the EEZ or continental shelf of India would be deemed to be produced
in India and subject to levy of Central excise duties under the Central Excise Act,
1944."
87. Similarly, in Circular No. 22 of 2002 dated 23-4- 2002, the said notification i.e. S.O. 189(E) has
been clari- fied in para 3 as under:
"3. The implication of the said notification is that miner- al oils extracted or produced
in the EEZ and continental shelf of India if brought to the mainland shall not be
treated as import and therefore, no customs duty shall be leviable on such mineral
oils. Likewise, the goods supplied from the mainland to a place in EEZ or continental
shelf of India in connection with any activity related to mineral oil extraction or
production shall not be treated as export un- der the Customs Act, 1962 and
consequently, no export benefits can be availed of on such supplies. Another im-
plication of the said notification is that bringing of any goods from any other country
to any place in EEZ or con- tinental shelf of India in connection with any activity re-
lated to extraction or production of mineral oils shall be treated as import under the
Customs Act, 1962 and would be charged to duty accordingly."

"97. The combined effect of these notifications is to ex- tend the application of the
Customs Act and the Customs Tariff Act to the aforesaid areas declared as
"designated areas" under the Maritime Zones Act, 1976. The further ef- fect of these
notifications is that the designated areas of the continental shelf and the exclusive
economic zone be- come a part of the territory of India for limited purposes. The
natural consequence of such declarations and the ex- tension of the Customs Act and
the Customs Tariff Act to these designated areas is to introduce the customs regime
to such areas resulting in the levy and collection of cus- toms duties on goods
imported into these areas as if these areas are a part of the territory of India. In these
circum- stances, the definition of "India" as given in Section 2(27) of the Customs Act
gets extended by these provisions to cover areas declared as designated areas beyond
the ter- ritorial waters and located the continental shelf and the exclusive economic
zone of India. If one reads the Cus- toms Act without reading the Maritime Zones Act,
1976, then the oil rig located in the notified areas/designated areas constitute "place
outside India". On the other hand, the very purpose of Sections 5, 6 and 7 of the
Maritime Zones Act, 1976 is to declare an area of the contiguous zone/continental
shelf/exclusive economic zone as a desig- nated area so that exploration, exploitation
and protection of resources belonging to India could be carried out. Under the said
Act, the Central Government can create artificial island, offshore terminals, etc. By
the said Act, customs and other fiscal enactments have been extended. There- fore,
the object is very clear that the revenue generated from exploration and exploitation
should accrue to the coastal State viz. India.
98. As stated above, the area of exclusive economic zone/continental shelf, where the
oil rigs are stationed (which of course is outside territorial waters) is deemed to be a
part of the territory of India under the Central Govern-
ment notifications issued pursuant to the provisions of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976.
The supply of imported spares or goods or equipments to the rigs by a ship will
attract import duty and the ship employed for transhipment of the goods for that
purpose would not be a foreign going vessel under Section 2(21) of the Customs Act.
The area of dis- charge or unloading/loading is within India by virtue of the deeming
provisions of Sections 6 and 7 of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976. The Customs Act
stands extended to the designated areas by virtue of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976.
The oil rigs carrying on operations in the designated area is not a foreign going vessel
as the same would be deemed to be a part of Indian territory i.e. going from the
territory of India to an area which also deemed to be part of the territory of India."
54. Thus, by virtue of the notifications dated 18th July, 1986 and 19th September, 1996 issued under
clause (a) of sub- section (5) of section 6 and clause (a) of sub-section (6) of section 7 of the
Maritime Zones Act, the Central Government has declared certain areas in the continental shelf or,
in the exclusive economic zone of India, where certain installations, structures and platforms of
certain coordinates given in the Schedule are situated and the areas extending upto 500 metres from
such installations, structures and platforms as "designated areas" for the purposes of sections 6 and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 85B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
7 of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976. In view of the above notifications, the designated areas of the
continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone become part of the territory of India for limited
purposes and the definition of "India" as given in section 2(27) of the Customs Act gets extended to
cover areas declared as designated areas beyond the territorial waters and located in the continental
shelf and the exclusive economic zone of India. Undisputedly, the provisions of the Central Sales Tax
Act have not been made applicable to the continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone and
having regard to the fact that these areas are outside the State of Gujarat, the question of applying
the provisions of the GST Act would not arise. But the question involved in the present case is not as
to whether the provisions of the CST Act or the GST Act would be applicable, but whether the
movement of goods from the Panna-Mukta oil fields to Hazira within the State of Gujarat is a sale in
the course of import into the territory of India. Therefore, what is required to be examined is
whether the Panna-Mukta oil fields can be said to be outside the territory of India. Since the
Panna-Mukta oil fields are situated in the exclusive economic zone, they are not situated within the
territory of India. But by virtue of a deeming fiction, in view of the above notifications issued under
the Maritime Zones Act, such territory is deemed to be a territory of India. However, such deeming
fiction also applies only to those enactments which have been specifically made applicable to the
said territory. As noted earlier, the provisions of the Customs Act have been made applicable to the
continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone for the purposes stated in the said notifications.
One such purpose is prospecting for extraction of production of mineral oils in the continental shelf
of India or the exclusive economic zone of India. It may be noted that for the purposes of the said
notification, 'mineral oils' include petroleum and natural gas. Thus, for the purpose of extraction of
natural gas in the continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone, the provisions of the Customs
Act apply. Consequently, the customs frontiers of India stand extended beyond the designated areas
viz., continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone for the said purpose and accordingly, the
Panna-Mukta oil fields fall within the customs frontiers of India.
55. On behalf of the petitioners, it has been contended that the extension of the customs frontiers of
India on account of the applicability of the provisions of the Customs Act to the designated area
would not mean that the territory of India stands extended to the designated area even for the
purpose of the Sales Tax Acts. For this purpose, reference may be made to section 5 of the Central
Sales Tax Act, which provides as to when a sale or purchase of goods is sought to take place in the
course of import or export. In the present case, the relevant provision would be sub-section (2) of
section 5, which says that a sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed to take place in the course of
import of goods into the territory of India only if the sale or purchase either occasions such import
or is effected by a transfer of documents of title to the goods before the goods have crossed the
customs frontiers of India. The expression "crossing the customs frontiers of India" has been
defined under clause (ab) of section 2 of the CST Act to mean crossing in the limits of the area of a
customs station in which the imported goods or export goods are ordinarily kept before clearance by
customs authorities. The explanation says that for the purpose of this clause, "customs station" and
"customs authorities" shall have the same meaning as in the Customs Act, 1962. Therefore, the
import of sub-section (2) of section 5 of the CST Act would be that for the purpose of falling within
the ambit of the expression "import" the goods have to cross the customs frontier so as to fall with
the purview of the expression "in the course of import into the territory of India". In the present
case, the provisions of the Customs Act have been made applicable to the designated areas and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 86B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
consequently, the customs frontiers stand extended beyond the designated areas and hence, the
Panna-Mukta oil fields from where the movement of goods is occasioned in the present case, fall
within the customs frontiers of India. Once the oil fields fall within the customs frontiers of India,
the movement of goods therefrom, cannot be said to be movement in the course of import of goods
into the territory of India, inasmuch as, the said oil fields are within the customs frontiers of India.
Therefore, the contention that the sale of goods has taken place in the course of import of goods into
the territory of India cannot be accepted. In the opinion of this court, there is no contradiction
between the decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of Commissioner of Sales Tax v. Pure
Helium (supra) and the decision of this court in the case of Larsen & Toubro Limited v. Union of
India (supra). In Larsen & Toubro Limited (supra), this court was seized with a matter wherein it
was contended that the movement of goods from Hazira to Bombay High was a movement of goods
from the State of Gujarat to another State within the country. The court held that the Bombay High
which is situated in the exclusive economic zone is part of the territory of India, sale of goods took
place at Bombay for which the goods moved from Hazira to Bombay, such movement does not get
covered within the expression "movement of goods from one State to another" contained in clause
(a) of section 3 of the CST Act as the goods having moved from one State to another since in the
opinion of this court Bombay High does not form part of any State of the Union of India. The court
held that in the absence of any notification extending the provisions of the Central Sales Tax to the
designated area, the respondents could not have demanded tax under the CST Act from the
petitioners on its sale of machinery parts etc, which sale was completed at Bombay High. Therefore,
the court in the said case was seized with a question as to whether the provisions of the CST Act
would be applicable to the designated area. In the context, the court held that since the provisions of
the CST Act had not been extended to the designated area, the provisions thereof would not be
attracted. The court also held that the Bombay High does not form part of any State of the Union of
India and hence, the sale in question cannot be said to be in the course of inter-State trade. In
Commissioner of Sales Tax v. Pure Helium (India) Limited (supra), the Bombay High Court was
seized with the question as to whether the sale of goods to the vendee situated in the Mumbai High
region can be said to be a sale in the course of export outside India as contemplated under section
5(1) of the CST Act. In the present case, the situation is converse namely, as to whether the sale of
goods from the vendor situated at Panna-Mukta oil fields are sales in the course of import into the
territory of India as contemplated by section 5(2) of the Central Sales Tax Act. This court is in
respectful agreement with the view adopted in the above decision of the Bombay High Court
whereby it is held that once the customs frontiers of India stand extended to the designated area,
there can be no export of goods to a territory which falls within the customs frontiers. An export of
goods involves movement of goods from within the customs frontier to a point beyond. Similarly,
the import of goods involves a movement of goods from a point which lies outside the customs
frontiers to a point within. The above decision would be squarely applicable to the facts of the
present case. Accordingly, the movement of goods, viz. natural gas from the Panna-Mukta oil fields
to Hazira within the State of Gujarat cannot be said to be in the course of import into the territory of
India, as the movement of goods is not from a place which lies outside the customs frontiers of India
so as to fall within the ambit of sub-section (2) of section 5 of the Act. Under the circumstances, in
the facts of the present case, it cannot be said that the sale of Natural Gas by the Contractor to GAIL
is in the course of import of goods into the territory of India.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 87B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
56. The learned advocates for the petitioners have submitted that the sweetening of gas at the
sweetening and separation facility of ONGC at Hazira does not amount to manufacture, whereas on
behalf of the respondents, it has been emphatically argued that having regard to the definition of
"manufacture" as defined under clause (16) of section 2 of the GST Act, the conversion of sour
natural gas into sweetened natural gas amounts to manufacture and would attract the provisions of
the GST Act. Having regard to the fact that this court has held that what was agreed to be purchased
was natural gas, and the goods as agreed viz. natural gas stood appropriated at the offshore
Processing Facility and delivered at the Delivery Point as contemplated under sub-clause (iv) of
clause (a) of Article 21.5.13 of the PSC, and consequently, the sale did not take place within the State
of Gujarat, the question as to whether subjecting the natural gas to the process of sweetening
amounts to manufacture is rendered redundant. Under the circumstances, it is not necessary to
enter into the merits of the question as to whether the processing of Natural Gas at the ONGC's
sweetening and separation facility whereby the sour gas is converted into sweetened gas, amounts to
manufacture or not.
57. At this juncture, it may be noted that on behalf of the respondent - State of Gujarat, Mr. S.N.
Shelat had submitted that the sale of goods is required to fall in any of the three categories namely,
(i) sale in the course of inter-State trade, (ii) sale in the course of import or export of goods, or (iii)
sale within the State. It was submitted that there is no fourth category and that in the present case, it
is an admitted position that the sale in question is not an inter-State trade, and according to the
respondents, the sale would not fall within the category of a sale in the course of import of goods
into the territory of India and hence, the sale can only fall within the third category, that is, within
the State of Gujarat.
58. In this regard, it may be apposite to refer to the decision of this court in the case of Larsen and
Toubro Ltd. v. Union of India (supra) wherein on behalf of the State it was contended that since the
sale can fall in only one of the three categories and that in the said case, the court must hold that it is
either inter-State sale or a local sale since the contention that the sale was an export sale had not
been pressed. In support of such contention, reliance was placed upon the decision of the Supreme
Court in the case of Murli Manohar & Co. and Another v. State of Haryana and Another, (1991) 1
SCC 377 wherein the court had held thus:
"8. Shri Rajaram Agarwal, learned counsel for the assessees raised a new contention
before us, which we have already referred to as an alternative contention. This
contention which really seems to be unanswerable appears to have been missed at the
stage of the High Court but this contention is purely one of law and merits
consideration. The point made by him was this. There is no dispute that the assessees
have transferred the manufactured goods by way of sale and that these goods have
been despatched to various ports of India. The exact terms of despatch are not clear
and there are no facts on record which will help us to understand the course of
transactions in the several cases before us. But Shri Agarwal submitted that the sales
made by the assessees can only fall within one of three categories. They are either
local sales or inter-State sales or export sales. Each of the assessees have sold its
goods to another dealer. If that dealer is also a resident of Haryana and has taken
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 88B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
delivery of the goods in Haryana and exported them thereafter, the assessees' sales
would be local sales. If the purchaser-dealer of the manufactured goods is in some
other State and the goods have been moved out of Haryana in pursuance of that sale,
they would be inter-State sales. The goods which have been sold by the assessee must
have been delivered to the dealer in pursuance of the sale either within the State or
outside the State in India. In either event, it would be a sale covered by the exceptions
in Section 9(1). It would be a local sale or inter-State sale. The only third possibility is
that assessee sold the goods to a dealer outside India and exported the goods in
pursuance of that sale in which event it would be a sale within the meaning of Section
5(1) of the Central Sales Tax Act.
9. We think Shri Agarwal is right in saying that any sale effected by the assessees in
the circumstances, which have been set out by us earlier, must fall in one of three
categories. We are unable to conceive of a fourth category of sale, which could be
neither a local sale nor an inter-State sale nor an export sale. Shri Gupta, on behalf of
the State, contended that the goods might have been directly moved by the assessee
to a port for shipment abroad in pursuance of an export contract entered into by the
dealer who purchased from the assessee. Even in such a case if the transport of gods
from the assessee's place of business to the port is in pursuance of the terms of sale,
the movement of the goods would be occasioned by the sale made by the assessee and
would be an inter-State sale. If, on the other hand, the goods were sent to the port by
the assessee subsequent to and independent of the sale made by him, then, for the
purpose of that transport, the assessee would only be an agent of the purchaser and
the movement of the goods in pursuance of the contract of sale entered into by the
purchaser and would be one in the course of export within the meaning of Section
5(1) of the C.S.T. Act. As pointed out by Shri Agarwal, even in Mohd. Sirajuddin case,
although the exemption claimed for the sales are export sales was denied, the
conclusion of the High Court that the sales to STC were inter-State sales chargeable
under Section 5(1) of the C.S.T. Act was upheld. We are, therefore, of the opinion that
this alternative contention urged by the learned counsel for the assessee has to be
accepted and it has to be held that, since the sales effected by the assessees fall within
one of the three exempted categories set out in Section 9(1)(b), there can be no levy of
purchase tax under Section 9(1) of the Act.
This court, after considering the above decision, held thus:
"We are, however, unable to accept the contention. The observations of the apex
court cannot be seen in isolation and it is well settled that it is not observation of the
court but what the court holds in the fact-situation of a given case which is the ratio
that can be applied in similar set of facts and circumstances. In the decision of Murli
Manohar & Co., [1991] 80 STC 79 (SC); [1991] 1 SCC 377, the apex court was not
considering the sale in the nature that we are confronted with. It was not a case
where the0 sale of goods occasioned the movement from the Indian State to a
territory which is not part of India and which is for the limited purpose of claiming
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 89B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
rights to exploit natural resources and exploration, etc., the Union of India claims
limited sovereign rights."
In the facts of the above case, it was held that when the sale of goods took place at Bombay High,
such movement was not covered within the expression "movement of goods from one State to
another" contained in clause (a) of section 3 of the CST Act. The goods had not moved from one
State to another since Bombay High does not form part of any State of the Union of India. In the
present case, this court has held that the movement of goods is not in the course of import of goods
into the territory of India and that the sale has not taken place within the State of Gujarat and the
parties do not dispute that the sale is not an inter-State trade. Therefore, the sale does not fall within
any of the three categories. This case is squarely covered by the above referred decision as the goods
have been sold within the deemed territory of India but not within any State of the Union of India.
As observed by this court in the above decision, the Supreme Court in the case of Murli Manohar &
Co. v. State of Haryana (supra) was dealing with a different set of circumstances and hence, the
observations made in that decision would not be applicable to the facts of the present case.
59. On behalf of the petitioners, it has also been contended that the show-cause notices for
reopening the assessment and the re-assessment orders are without jurisdiction and ab initio void.
It has been contended that in respect of five years, namely, 1997-98 to 2001-02, the original
assessment of the assessee namely, BG Exploration is a 'nil' assessment insofar as the Panna-Mukta
gas is concerned. Notices of reassessment in each of these five years were issued on 20th October,
2003 and the reply of the petitioners was filed on 12th December, 2003 and the reassessment orders
were passed on 9th January, 2004 and for others, on 20th January, 2004. It has been submitted
that on 30th September, 1999, the petitioner had written to the Additional Commissioner of Sales
Tax enclosing a copy of the PSC and relying upon several Articles thereof. On 7th January, 2002, the
Additional Commissioner of Sales Tax had issued a show-cause notice for the year 2001-02 with
reference to the letter dated 30th September, 1999 wherein he had dealt with various aspects of the
PSC according to his interpretation. On 28th January, 2002, the petitioner submitted a reply relying
on various clauses of the PSC and in paragraph 7 thereof, a specific reference was made to ISPA. On
4th March, 2002, the petitioner filed a supplementary reply clarifying some issues such as delivery
point, etc. and explained the difference between sour gas and sweetened gas and maintained that
they continue to remain the same commercial commodity. Thus, the Assessing Officer had before
him the PSC and the ISPA as well as detailed submissions made by the petitioners on various
clauses of the PSC. After considering all the above material, the Assessing Officer passed a 'nil'
assessment order (so far as Panna-Mukta gas was concerned) for the year 2001- 02 on 30th June,
2003 and on the same date, a 'nil' assessment order was also passed for the year 2000-01. According
to the petitioners, having regard to the fact that 'nil' assessment orders were passed on 30th June,
2003, there was absolutely no reason to believe that any turnover of Panna-Mukta gas had escaped
assessment to invoke section 44 of the Gujarat Sales Tax Act on 20th October, 2003 and that
between 30th June, 2003 and 20th October, 2003, the Assessing Officer had no new material before
him nor did he discover any new fact that was unknown to him. Reliance has been placed upon
various decisions of the Supreme Court as referred to hereinabove. On behalf of the respondents, it
has been contended that the respondent authorities were required to carry out reassessment under
section 44 of the GST Act for the reason that the petitioners in their returns did not show the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 90B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
transaction of Panna-Mukta gas fields and thus, evaded tax. It was only after a search operation was
carried out that the respondent authorities issued a show-cause notice and a statutory notice for
reassessment under section 44 of the GST Act, 1969. Since the decisions of the Supreme Court in
Calcutta Discount v. ITO, Ganga Saran v. ITO, C.I.T. v. Kelvinator, Phoolchand v. ITO, etc. have
been rendered in the context of the Income Tax Act, it may be germane to refer to the decision of a
Division Bench of this court in the case of Batliboi & Co. Ltd. v. Sales Tax Officer (I), Class-I,
Division 1, Surat, (2000) 119 STC 583, wherein orders of provisional assessment were subject matter
of challenge in a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The court held thus:
17. Section 41B providing for provisional assessment reads as under:
"41B. Provisional assessment.--(1) Where the Commissioner has reason to believe
that the dealer has evaded the tax, he may, after taking into account all relevant
materials gathered by him and after giving the dealer a reasonable opportunity of
being heard, provisionally assess to the best of his judgment the amount of tax
payable by the dealer.
(2) The provisions of this Act shall mutatis mutandis apply to the provisional
assessment as if provisional assessment were an assessment made under this Act."
(Underlining* to invite pointed attention and for emphasis)
18. A bare perusal of the abovequoted provision would go to show that resort to provisional
assessment can be made by the Commissioner or his delegate as assessing authority only if he "has
reason to believe that a dealer has evaded the tax".
19. Neither in its show cause notice issued prior to making a provisional assessment nor in the
assessment orders, the assessing authority has recorded reasons or grounds for coming to the
conclusion that dealer has evaded the tax. As has been mentioned above is the order effecting the
seizure of its account books, the assessing authority found that certain works contracts were liable to
be taxed under the Central Sales Tax Act which were in the nature of branch transfers. In the orders
of assessment, the assessing authority has reproduced the stand taken on behalf of the assessee that
'such branch transfers were made for completing the works in accordance with the orders and
specification of customers outside the State and were not sales but were merely transactions in the
course of works contract'. The assessing officer has also in the order of assessment, rejected the
contention advanced on behalf of the petitioner that the branch transfers were inter-State works
contract and not inter-State sales. He held them exigible to tax under the Central Act. It is on taking
such view of law that the assessing officer provisionally assessed the petitioner and consequently
imposed tax, interest and penalty on it for the different assessment periods under consideration. On
the facts and legal position disclosed by the dealer, we do not find that there existed any grounds
and circumstances for the assessing officer to reasonably form an opinion "that the dealer has
evaded the tax". Such formation of opinion is pre-condition for invoking the power of provisional
assessment under section 41B of the Act. In its affidavit in reply to the petition, the impugned order
and provisional assessments are sought to be supported by stating thus:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 91B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
"as a very large amount of tax was involved and regular assessment of the petitioner
was likely to take time, I decided to make provisional assessment."
20. From the portion quoted above, it is amply clear that at no point of time the assessing officer
had any reason to believe that the dealer has evaded the tax. The expression "evasion of tax" conveys
mens rea on the part of the dealer. The expression conveys a meaning that the dealer by infringing
the law has been trying to avoid payment of tax in due time.
60. It may be noted that in some of the cases before this court, orders of provisional assessment are
under challenge whereas in some cases orders of re-assessment are under challenge. While taking
action under section 41B of the GST Act, the Commissioner should have reason to believe that the
dealer has evaded the tax, whereas while taking action under section 44 of the GST Act, the
Commissioner should have reason to believe that any turnover of sales or turnover of purchases of
any goods chargeable to tax under that Act has escaped assessment or has been under-assessed or
assessed at a lower rate in respect of any period in an order of assessment under section 41.
Therefore, in either case, the Commissioner should have reason to believe that the dealer has evaded
the tax; or that any turnover of sale or purchase of goods chargeable to tax has escaped assessment
or is under assessed or assessed at a lower rate. Therefore, while resorting to provisional assessment
or reassessment, the Commissioner should have reason to believe. In the present case, a perusal of
one of the show cause notices issued under section 44 of the GST Act reveals that according to the
Commissioner the petitioner had not being paying sales tax on the sale of natural gas pursuant to
the PSC because the delivery point was offshore underline connection at ONGC's existing pipeline
and title of goods passed to GAIL at the same point, however, a sale of ascertained goods cannot be
deemed to take place in the state of origin because the commingled and unsweetened gas is
unascertained or future goods and it is only at the time of their appropriation as sweetened gas to
the contract of sale by them to GAIL at Hazira, where actual physical delivery and sales takes place.
In this regard, it may be noted that similar objections were raised by the Commissioner in the year
1999, pursuant to which Enron, the predecessor of the petitioner - BG Exploration had given its
reply dated 3rd September, 1999. Thereafter, the Additional Commissioner had addressed a
communication dated 15th September, 1999 calling for further details, in response to which the said
petitioner had given a detailed reply dated 23rd September, 1999. On 7th January, 2002, the
Additional Commissioner of Sales Tax (Enforcement) issued a show cause notice for the year
2001-2002 referring to the above letter dated 3rd September, 1999 and dealt with various aspects of
the PSC according to his interpretation. In response thereto, the petitioner gave a detailed reply
dated 28th January, 2002 as well as a reply dated 4th March, 2002 clarifying some issues such as
Delivery Point as well as the difference between sweet and sour gas, etc. and the fact that sweet and
sour gas remain the same commercial commodity. The Assessing Officer, therefore, had before him,
the PSC, the ISPA as well as the detailed submissions of the petitioner on various clauses of the PSC
and after considering all the above material, he passed a NIL assessment order for the year 2001-02
on 30th June, 2003. On the same day, NIL assessment order was also passed for the year 2000-01.
Thereafter show cause notice dated 20 th October, 2003 came to be issued under section 44 of the
GST Act for reassessment for the year 1998-99. Similar show cause notices have been issued in
respect of subsequent years also.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 92B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
61. From the facts noted hereinabove, as well as on a perusal of the show cause notice dated 7th
January, 2002 issued by the Additional Commissioner, it is evident that the show cause notice for
re-assessment had been issued on the very same grounds as in the previous show cause notice.
Therefore, when the Assessing Officer had, after applying his mind to the material produced before
him and the grounds raised by him and the explanation given by the petitioner, issued a subsequent
show cause notice on the very same grounds, it is nothing but a mere change of opinion. A perusal of
the subsequent show cause notice shows that there is no other material before the Assessing Officer
between 30th June, 2003 when the assessment order for the year 2001-02 came to be made and
20th October, 2003 when the notice under section 44 of the GST Act came to be issued. The show
cause notice reads thus:
"With reference to above, it has come to our notice that you have been supplying
natural gas from Panna- Mukta Gas fields to M/s. GAS AUTHORITY OF INDIA
LTD., HAZIRA, since 1997-98.
You have not been paying any Sales Tax in Gujarat State on said transactions on the
ground that delivery point of Panna-Mukta Fields is at offshore underline connection
at O.N.G.C's existing pipeline and title of goods is passed to GAIL at the same point.
Hence movement of goods from Panna-Mukta gas fields to Hazira is in pursuance of
productions sharing contract, falling u/s 3 or 5 of Central Sales Act. Therefore it is
exempted from Sales Tax in Gujarat State.
But looking to the facts and legal position, a sale of ascertained goods can not be
deemed to take place in the stage of origin becauses the commingled and
unsweetened gas is unascertained or future goods and it is only at the time of their
appropriation as sweetened gas to the contract of sale by you to GAIL. at Hazira,
Where actual physical delivery and sales takes place. Hence, you are liable to any
Sales Tax in Gujarat State on the sales of Panna-Mukta Gas fields as per Gujarat Sales
Tax - 1969.
Your assessment for the Year ______98-99____ is finalised on dt.
______5-5-2000___ under Section 41(3) of GUJARAT SALES TAX ACT. is
proposed to Re-assessment. Therefore you are required to remain present at above
mentioned address on dt. 10-11-2003 with your explanation that why Sales Tax,
penalty and interest should not be levied on said transactions as per Gujarat Sales
Tax Act - 1969, Failure of which may result in to exparty decision. The notice under
section - 44 of Gujarat Sales Tax, No.37, for Re-assessment for the year _98-99____
is attached herewith and detailed statement of Sales of Panna-Mukta Gas Oil field,
Since 1997-98 to 2001- 2003 is also attached herewith."
62. At this juncture, reference may be made to the reply dated 28th January, 2002 of the petitioners
and more particularly paragraphs 23 to 27 thereof, which clearly show that the very issues raised in
the present show cause notice had already been dealt with in detail by the petitioners, and such
explanation had been accepted by the Assessing Officer who passed a NIL assessment order.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 93B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
Therefore, while issuing the show cause notice under section 44 of the GST Act, the Commissioner
was required to have reason to believe that any turnover of sales or purchase had escaped
assessment. The formation of such opinion is a precondition for exercise of powers, both under
section 41 as well as section 44 of the GST Act. The Supreme Court in Commissioner of Income-Tax
v. Kelvinator of India Ltd. (supra) has in the context of section 147 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 held
thus:
"On going through the changes, quoted above, made to Section 147 of the Act, we find
that, prior to the Direct Tax Laws (Amendment) Act, 1987, reopening could be done
under the above two conditions and fulfilment of the said conditions alone conferred
jurisdiction on the assessing officer to make a back assessment, but in Section 147 of
the Act (with effect from 1-4-1989), they are given a go-by and only one condition has
remained viz. that where the assessing officer has reason to believe that income has
escaped assessment, confers jurisdiction to reopen the assessment. Therefore,
post-1-4-1989, power to reopen is much wider. However, one needs to give a
schematic interpretation to the words "reason to believe"
failing which, we are afraid, Section 147 would give arbitrary powers to the assessing officer to
reopen assessments on the basis of "mere change of opinion", which cannot be per se reason to
reopen. We must also keep in mind the conceptual difference between power to review and power to
reassess. The assessing officer has no power to review; he has the power to reassess. But
reassessment has to be based on fulfilment of certain precondition and if the concept of "change of
opinion" is removed, as contended on behalf of the Department, then, in the garb of reopening the
assessment, review would take place."
63. On a plain reading of the above show cause notice, it is apparent that the same does not disclose
the formation of any opinion on the part of the Commissioner based on any new material on record.
The re-assessment is, therefore, sought to be made on a mere change of opinion. As held by the
Supreme Court in Kelvinator of India Ltd. (supra) a mere change of opinion cannot be per se reason
to reopen an assessment. Therefore, the show cause notices which form the basis of the impugned
assessment orders are without jurisdiction as the same have been issued without formation of the
requisite opinion as required under the provisions of section 41 and 44 of the GST Act.
Consequently, the assessment orders based upon such show cause notices cannot be sustained.
64. On behalf of the respondents, a preliminary objection has been raised with regard to the very
maintainability of the petitions on the ground that the petitioners have an alternative statutory
remedy by way of appeal available under the provisions of the GST Act and the petitioners have also
resorted to such remedy.
65. On behalf of the respondent State authorities, Mr. P.K. Jani, learned Additional Advocate
General has contended that these petitions are not maintainable, inasmuch as, the petitions involve
disputed questions of fact and the petitioners have already availed of the alternative statutory
remedy under section 65 of the GST Act and the appeals preferred by the petitioners are pending for
final adjudication. Therefore, these petitions are required to be rejected on the ground of there being
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 94B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
an efficacious alternative remedy available to the petitioners. In support of such submission,
reliance was placed upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Titaghur Paper Mills Company
Limited v. State of Orissa, AIR 1983 SC 603, wherein the court held that under the scheme of the
Orissa Sales Tax Act, there is a hierarchy of authorities before which the petitioner could get
adequate redress against the wrongful acts complained of and as regards the remedy of applying for
stay of recovery to the Commissioner of Sales tax under the relevant provisions of the said Act and
dismissed the petitions. It may be noted that in the facts of the said case the assessment orders were
challenged on the ground of being arbitrary etc. The very jurisdiction to levy sales tax was not
subject matter of challenge therein. The decision of the Supreme Court in Sales Tax Officer, Jodhpur
v. M/s Shiv Ratan G. Mohatta, AIR 1966 SC 142, was cited wherein the court found that no
exceptional circumstances existed in that case to warrant the exercise of extraordinary jurisdiction
under Article 226. The court held that it was not the object of Article 226 to convert High Courts
into original or appellate assessing authorities whenever an assessee chose to attack an assessment
order on the ground that the sale was made in the course of import and, therefore, exempt from tax.
The court was of the view that there must be something more in a case to warrant the entertainment
of a petition under Article 226, something going to the root of the jurisdiction of the Sales Tax
Officer, something to show that it would be a case of palpable injustice to the assessee to force him
to adopt the remedies provided under that Act. Reliance was placed upon the decision of the
Supreme Court in Jaipur Shahar Hindu Vikas Samiti v. State of Rajasthan, (2014) 5 SCC 530,
wherein the court held that the appellant therein had availed the alternative remedy available under
the Rajasthan Public Trusts Act, 1959 and cannot be permitted to avail two remedies
simultaneously. The decision of the Supreme Court in Kanaiyalal Lalchand Sachdev v. State of
Maharashtra, (2011) 2 SCC 782, was cited for the proposition that it is well-settled that ordinarily
relief under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India is not available to any aggrieved person
when the statute itself contemplates an efficacious remedy. Reliance was also placed upon the
decision of the Supreme Court in State of Goa v. Leukoplast India Limited, AIR 1997 SC 1875,
wherein the court, after observing that the controversy involved therein related basically to
questions of facts held that there was no reason for the assessee to bypass the statutory remedy and
come to the court with a writ petition. It was argued that the present case also involves disputed
questions of facts and therefore, there is no warrant for intervention by this court. It was,
accordingly, urged that the petitioners be relegated to pursue the statutory remedy under the GST
Act. On the other hand, on behalf of the petitioners, the learned counsel had submitted that since
the reassessment orders passed in the year 2004 are wholly without jurisdiction, the present
petitions have been filed to quash the said orders and to declare that the sale of natural gas by the
petitioners to Government of India cannot be taxed in view of Article 286 of the Constitution read
with section 5 of the CST Act. It was submitted that the petitions are maintainable because the
impugned assessment orders are without jurisdiction and because they were passed by reopening
the assessments without having "reason to believe" that any turnover had escaped assessment. It
was argued that the petitioners are not obliged to avail of the alternative remedy but can maintain a
writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. In support of such submission, the
learned counsel placed reliance upon the decisions of the Supreme Court in the case of Raza Textiles
v. Income Tax Officer, Whirlpool Corporation v. Registrar of Trademarks and Godrej Sala Lee v.
Assistant Commissioner (supra). It was further submitted that the present petitions came to be
admitted in the year 2004 and after elaborate hearing, an interim order came to be passed by the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 95B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
Division Bench on 29th April, 2004 pursuant to which the petitioner paid tax at the rate of 4% with
interest at 18% for the years 1997-98 to 2001-02 and for the years 2002-03 and 2003-04 and for the
period after 1st April, 2004, the petitioner paid at the rate of 4% until the tax regime changed on 1st
April, 2005. It was submitted that, therefore, at this stage, it would be iniquitous to ask the
petitioners to avail of the alternative remedy without deciding the constitutional and legal issues
that arise and that have been argued extensively in these proceedings. In support of such
submission, reliance was placed upon the decisions of this court in the case of Pioma Industries v.
Union of India and Indian Tourist Development Corporation through Ashoka Hotel v. Assistant
Commission of Commercial Taxes (supra).
66. Out of this batch of seven petitions, three petitions were filed in the year 2004 and subsequently,
after bipartite hearing, interim orders had been passed by the Division Bench on 29th April, 2004.
The other four petitions have been filed between 2007 to 2010. By the present petitions, the
petitioners have challenged the very validity of the tax sought to be levied by the respondent State
authorities on the ground that the sales in question having been made outside the State of Gujarat,
are not amenable to levy of tax under the Gujarat Sales Tax Act. Thus, the petitioners have
challenged the very jurisdiction of the respondent State authorities to levy the tax in question. The
Supreme Court in Raza Textiles v. ITO (supra) has held thus:-
"The Appellate Bench appears to have been under the impression that the Income
Tax Officer was the sole Judge of the fact whether the firm in question was resident
or non-resident. This conclusion in, our opinion, is wholly wrong. No authority, much
less a quasi-judicial authority, can confer jurisdiction on itself by deciding a
jurisdictional fact wrongly. The question whether the jurisdictional fact has been
rightly decided or not is a question that is open for examination by the High Court in
an application for a writ of certiorari. If the High Court comes to the conclusion, as
the learned Single Judge has done in this case, that the Income Tax Officer had
clutched at the jurisdiction by deciding a jurisdictional fact erroneously, then the
assessee was entitled for the writ of certiorari prayed for by him. It is
incomprehensible to think that a quasi-judicial authority like the Income Tax Officer
can erroneously decide a jurisdictional fact and thereafter proceed to impose a levy
on a citizen. In our opinion, the Appellate Bench is wholly wrong in opining that the
Income Tax Officer can "decide either way".
67. In Whirlpool Corporation v. Registrar of Trademarks (supra), the Supreme Court held that
under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Court, having regard to the facts of the case, has a
discretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ petition. But the High Court has imposed upon itself
certain restrictions one of which is that if an effective and efficacious remedy is available, the High
Court would not normally exercise its jurisdiction. But the alternative remedy has been consistently
held by the Supreme Court not to operate as a bar in at least three contingencies, namely, where the
writ petition has been filed for the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights or where there has
been violation of the principles of natural justice or where the order or proceedings are wholly
without jurisdiction or the vires of an Act is challenged.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 96B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
68. In Godrej Sara Lee v. Commissioner (AA) (supra), the Supreme Court was of the opinion that
the question as to whether the notification referred to therein could have a retrospective effect or
retroactive operation was a jurisdictional fact and should have been determined by the High Court
in exercise of its writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India as it is well known
that when an order of a statutory authority is questioned on the ground that the same suffers from a
lack of jurisdiction, alternative remedy may not be a bar.
69. In Sales Tax Officer, Jodhpur v. M/s Shiv Ratan G. Mohatta (supra), the Supreme Court held to
there must be something more in a case to warrant the entertainment of a petition under Article
226, something going to the root of the jurisdiction of the Sales Tax Officer, something to show that
it would be a case of palpable injustice to the assessee to force him to adopt the remedies provided
by the Act. In the present case, the controversy raised in the petitions goes to the root of the
jurisdiction of the Sales Tax Officer to levy tax under the GST Act. Therefore, it would be highly
unjust to ask the assessee to avail of the alternative statutory remedy when the entire proceedings
are without jurisdiction.
70. As regard the contention raised by the learned Additional Advocate General that the petitions
involve disputed questions of fact, such contention must be stated, only to be rejected. These
petitions as discussed hereinabove raise neat questions of law, which are required to be decided on a
construction of the provisions of the agreements between the parties and the relevant statutory
provisions. While deciding the questions arising in these petitions, this court has not been called
upon to touch any issue involving a disputed question of fact.
71. Thus, in the light of the above decisions, it is apparent that where the very jurisdiction of the
concerned authority is called in question and the petitions do not involve any disputed questions of
fact, the validity of an alternative remedy would not be a bar to entertaining a writ petition under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Moreover, the present petitions have been filed way back in
the years 2004 to 2010. At the relevant time, the court had admitted the petitions and had granted
interim relief after bipartite hearing. The decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Indian Tourist
Development Corporation Ltd. v. CCT (supra) wherein the court having regard to the fact that the
matter pertained to assessment year 2004-05 did not find it in the interest of justice to relegate the
appellant therein to the statutory authorities specially when the legal position was very clear and the
law was also in favour of the appellant, would be squarely applicable to the facts of the present case
wherein the assessment orders are from 1997-98 to 2001-02 and the legal position is, as discussed
hereinabove, clearly in favour of the petitioners, it would, therefore, not be in the interest of justice
to relegate the petitioners to avail of the remedy before the statutory authorities. In the aforesaid
premises, the availability of the efficacious alternative remedy when the very jurisdiction of the
respondent authorities has been called in question, would not be a bar to this court in entertaining
the present writ petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The said contention is,
therefore, rejected.
72. TO SUMMARISE i. On a conjoint reading of the Production Sharing Contract and the Interim
Sales and Purchase Agreement, it is apparent that what was agreed to be sold and purchased was
Natural Gas.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 97B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
ii. At the stage when the PSC came to be executed, the gas was not discovered and was still in the
wells and it was not even certain as to whether the Government of India would purchase all the Gas
that is produced and delivered. Therefore, though under the PSC 100% of the deliverability of ANG
and NANG and Condensate was agreed to be produced and delivered, the goods viz., natural gas
cannot be said to be ascertained goods at the time when the Production Sharing Contract came to be
executed. Clause (a) of section 4(2) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 would not be applicable to the
transactions in question.
iii. On a combined reading of the PSC and the ISPA, the delivery point is at the downstream weld at
the underwater connection between the Sellers' pipeline and ONGC's underwater Gas transmission
line/lines which transport Gas from the Bassein Field to Hazira area, viz., the "Delivery Point" as
contemplated under clause (a)(iv) of Article 21.5.13 of the PSC and not downstream of the
sweetening and separation facility owned and operated by ONGC.
iv. The ISPA executed between the constituents of the Contractor and the GAIL cannot amend,
modify, vary or supplement the PSC. The price clause as contained in the ISPA which provides for
payment at the rate of 90% of the Gas price specified in Article 21.5.13(d) of the PSC for the net
MMBtu of gas delivered at the downstream of ONGC facility at Hazira, would not modify the
principal agreement between the parties, namely that the Gas is to be delivered at the Delivery Point
as contemplated in clause (a)(iv) of Article 21.5.13 of the PSC nor can the same be read to mean that
the parties had agreed to sell and purchase sweetened Gas.
v. The price clause contained in the ISPA is only a mechanism by which the parties have decided the
price of the goods and cannot be relied upon to decide the situs of the sale. Merely because the
Sellers have decided to charge on the basis of what is ultimately received by the Buyer cannot be
determinative of the fact as to where the sale takes place.
vi. The goods, viz., Natural Gas were ascertained goods at the time when they came to be separated
and measured at the Offshore Processing Facility. The ascertained goods upon being separated and
measured came to be appropriated to the contract and delivered at the Delivery Point. In terms of
Article 27.2 of the PSC, the title to the goods also passed to the Buyer at the Delivery Point. The situs
of the sale is the Offshore Processing Facility where the goods were appropriated to the contract.
Therefore, it cannot be said that the goods in question were within the State of Gujarat at the time of
their appropriation to the contract of sale so as to fall within the ambit of clause (b) of section 4(2) of
the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956. The transactions in question are, therefore, not amenable to tax
under the provisions of the Gujarat Sales Tax Act, 1969.
vii. Merely because the Natural Gas upon being delivered at the Delivery Point was commingled with
other gases, does not mean that it was not in a deliverable state because having regard to its unique
physical properties, large volumes of Natural Gas can be transported only in a continuous stream
and once delivered in the pipeline for transportation, it becomes commingled with other natural gas.
Individual molecules are not separately indentified and cannot be accurately tracked or traced. As a
result, natural gas is sold and purchased on a "quality and quantity" basis.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/3793152/ 98B G Exploration And Production India ... vs State Of Gujarat Through Secretary & 8 on 8 May, 2015
viii.The act of sweetening of natural gas, having taken place post appropriation, after the goods were
delivered and the title had passed to the Buyer outside the State of Gujarat, merely because post
appropriation the goods were subjected to the process of sweetening within the State of Gujarat it
cannot be said that the sale of goods has taken place within the State of Gujarat.
ix. Since the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962 have been extended beyond the designated area,
the Panna Mukta oil fields from where the movement of goods is occasioned fall within the customs
frontiers of India Consequently, the sale of goods cannot be said to have taken place in the course of
import of goods into the territory of India as contemplated under sub-section (2) of section 5 of the
Central Sales Tax Act, 1956.
x. Since the the sale of goods has taken place outside the State of Gujarat, the question as to whether
or not subjecting the Natural Gas to the process of sweetening amounts to manufacture becomes
redundant, and hence, it not necessary to enter into the merits of the question as to whether or not
the processing of the Natural Gas at ONGC's sweetening and separation facility at Hazira, whereby
the sour gas is converted into sweetened gas, amounts to manufacture.
xi. The show cause notices which form the basis of the impugned assessment orders are without
jurisdiction as the same have been issued without formation of the requisite opinion as required
under the provisions of section 41 and 44 of the Gujarat Sales Tax Act, 1969 and are based on a mere
change of opinion.
xii. As the controversy involved in the present case goes to the very root of the jurisdiction of the
Sales Tax Officer to levy sales tax under the provisions of the Gujarat Sales Tax Act, 1969, the
availability of an alternative statutory remedy would not preclude the petitioners from invoking the
extraordinary jurisdiction of this court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
73. In the light of the above discussion, the petitions succeed and are accordingly allowed. Having
regard to the fact that this court has held that the sales in question have not taken place within the
State of Gujarat, the State of Gujarat has no authority to levy the sales tax under the provisions of
the GST Act on the transactions in question. Consequently, all the assessment orders which have
been called in question in each of the petitions are hereby quashed and set aside.
74. Vide interim orders dated 1st April, 2004 and 29th April, 2004 passed in Special Civil
Application No.2071/2004, 2084/2004 and 3119/2004, this court had directed the petitioners to
deposit the amount as stated therein with the respondent State authorities towards grant of partial
interim relief in favour of the petitioners. In the light of the view taken by this court, the petitioners
shall be entitled to refund of the amount deposited with the respondents with interest at the rate of
9% per annum. Rule is made absolute accordingly in each of the petitions.
