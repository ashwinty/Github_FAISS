Yash Pal Marwaha vs Pushpa Builders Ltd. And Anr. on 5 September, 2005
Bench: M Shah, P Shenoy
ORDER P.D. Shenoy, Member
1. This is a case wherein a builder promised a Non-Resident Indian (NRI) to allot a deluxe
residential flat in Krishna block in the year 1989, in the complex of Pushpa Aakash Apartments to be
built exclusively for NRIs, which was never built. Ultimately, the purchaser was offered a flat in
'KAVERI' block in an unfinished condition, which, till today, is not finished and it does not have a
completion certificate from the Competent Authority i.e., Ghaziabad Development Authority.
2. Heard Mr. B.S. Mor, learned Counsel for the complainant and Dr. J.C. Batra, learned Senior
Counsel for the opposite parties.
Case of the complainant:
3. The complainant, Shri Yash Pal Marwaha, a Non-Resident Indian (NRI) residing in United
Kindom, has filed this complaint through his duly appointed true and lawful General Power of
Attorney. It is the say of the complainant that M/s. Pushpa Builders Ltd., (Builder), opposite party,
during the years 1988-89, attracted the citizens of India by colourful and attractive advertisements
about its having purchased land on freehold basis in Vaishali, District Ghaziabad (U.P.) for
constructing high-rise apartments known as Pushpa Akash Apartments with five blocks namely
'GANG A', 'YAMUNA', 'GODAVARI', 'KAVERI' and 'Saraswati' and for the NRIs 'NRI EXCLUSIVE'
deluxe apartments with special features at considerably higher rates in the name of 'KRISHNA'
block. In the month of July, 1989, the complainant booked and secured allotment of fla t No. F-7 at a
cost of 44,156. The complainant went on paying instalments for this flat. Suddenly the opposite
party unilaterally and arbitrarily offered to allot another apartment No. B5SC4 lower FF in 'Kaveri'
block meant for the Indians only, through a letter vide reference PBL/NRI/11723 dated 3.12.1991
stating the same to be a final allotment. The complainant immediately got the offer of allotment of
the alternate apartment repudiated through his Solicitor based in U.K., London, and demanded
refund of money with interest within a period of 30 days. Around this very aforesaid period itself,
there was a rumour that the entire project stood abandoned due to the involvement of Shri V.K.
Soin, CMD of the opposite party, in a murder case which was found to be true and correct later on
vide judgment and order dated 28.8.1997 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, New Delhi.
However, as the substantial amount for the flat was paid by the complainant, the complainant had
no option but to accept the allotment of inferior flat in 'KAVERI' block.
4. Finally, the sale deed was executed on 14.3,1992 after about 3 years from the date of booking and
original allotment of the flat in the form of mechanically published small register. The builder
symbolically handed over the incomplete and unauthorized flat in an uninhabitable condition to the
complainant on 14.3.1994 and the complainant was promised that all the amenities/facilities
mentioned in the brochures, handbills and handouts would be provided soon. The situation is
almost the same even today as was in the year, 1994.

5. The 'KAVERI' block in which the flat in question is situated has not yet been notified as complete
by the statutory authority i.e., Proforma opposite party No. 2 herein and the opposite party No. 1 has
not been able to get a 'Completion Certificate' from the said concerned statutory authority i.e., the
Ghaziabad Development Authority, Ghaziabad. It has been alleged that he said Authority has
cancelled the very site plan of the project/building in question and an affidavit has been filed in the
Hon'ble High Court of Allahabad by the said Authority in this respect. The opposite party No. 1, on
the one hand, having failed to complete the building and make available the promised
amenities/facilities; on the other in the guise of the sale agreement, used to send maintenance bills
year after year from 1994.
6. Further in the complaint lodged before the police Shri V.K. Soin, M.D. of M/s. Pushpa Builders
unequivocally also agreed to charge for the common maintenance, etc. @ 50% of rates mentioned in
the agreement dated 14.3.1992 w.e.f. the beginning of the year of the actual and physical occupation
by the complainant or his wife as the case may be in their respective flats subject to the availability
of the amenities/facilities promised in the advertisements, brochure, handouts and hand bills and
also as stipulated in the sale agreement itself. He also promised that facilities as promised shall be
made available within a year or so. In view of the said compromise/settlement dated 25.2.2000, the
matter was closed with the liberty to initiate any proceedings for any Civil or Criminal action against
he opposite party No. 1 as and when advised, desired and considered proper and appropriate.
Consequently, the company rightly did not send any bill of maintenance in the years, 2000 and 2001
in view of the above settlement. All of a sudden, without any rhyme or reason, the opposite party No.
1 shot letters of demand of Rs, 5,78,757 for one portion B5 and Rs. 1,85,800 for another portion C4,
both the portions of the same flat in April, 2002 on account of common maintenance, etc. to the
complainant in U.K. followed by other arbitrary and uncalled for communications, backtracking
from the settlement arrived at on 25,2.2000 before the police authorities.
7. Opposite party No. 1 did not stop there and in highly arbitrary and discriminatory manner
invoked Clause 29 of the Sale Agreement in a whimsical manner by sending the notices pf
termination dated 20.4.2002 of the gale Agreement dated 14.3.1992. Further it is pointed out that
opposite party No. 1 has already been directed by this Commission to refund the entire amount paid
by some of the buyers along with 18% interest and also pay the compensation in two exactly similar
and identical O.P. No. 60/1994 and O.P. No. 215/1996 pertaining to the same premises/building in
the complex of Pushpa Akash Apartments, Vaishali, Ghaziabad vide orders dated 21.6.1996 and
28.9.2001 respectively. It is noted here that the later case is reported in II (2002) CPJ 83 (NC),
wherein the reference of the former case is also duly given. However, the complainant being not a
member of the M/s Pushpa Builders Flat Buyers Association (Regd.) could not know about the
aforesaid orders earlier, passed on the respective complaints of the aforesaid Association (Regd.).
The complainant could know only about a year back from Ms. Kusum Singh, his wife's General
Attorney who happens to reside in the same 'KAVERI' block m the same complex and who herself
only knew through the notices of Termination of Agreements for the flats of some of the buyers,
affixed on the doors of their flats by the opposite party No. 1 referring the particulars of the aforesaid
litigation.
Submission by learned Counsel Mr. Mor for the complainant:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1784441/ 2Yash Pal Marwaha vs Pushpa Builders Ltd. And Anr. on 5 September, 2005
8. Mr. Mor during arguments submitted that in this case deficiency of service is proved. He quoted
headnote of the earlier judgment of this Commission in Original Petition No. 215 of 1996-Pushpa
Builders Flat Buyers Association v. Pushpa Builders Ltd., wherein it was held that builder had failed
to deliver possession as per promise. The Commission also held that:
we see a continued cause of action. We are even otherwise inclined to condone the delay, if any,
keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case.
9. He submitted that only technical possession of the incomplete building was taken and if the
complainant had not taken possession then it would have resulted in not having a flat in hand at all.
He submitted that before the Sub-Inspector, Sh. V.K. Sharma, Police Station, Kalkaji on 25.2.2000,
the respondent has admitted that since he could not provide the flat in Krishna Appt. (Tower) and
could not provide promised amenities/facilities, he shall try his best to provide all
facilities/amenities similar to those in Krishna tower within the shortest possible time and would
complete the construction work of Kaveri which was half-built,
10. The builder was silent, He did not take any action to complete the building but unilaterally in the
year, 2002 terminated the agreement.
Notice for termination of Agreement--
Since you have committed default and have failed to comply with the notice of demand dated
2.4.2002, the company in exercise of its power under Section 29 of the Sale Agreement dated
14.3.1992, hereby terminates the said Agreement and cancels the allotment of Unit No. B-5, Lower
First Floor, Kaveri Block in project Pushpa Akash Apartments and you are called upon to hand over
the vacant and the peaceful possession of the said premises on 27.4.2002 at time 2.30 p.m.
11. Mr, Mor submitted that even today the building is incomplete and he has asked Ghaziabad
Development Authority (GDA) to clarify whether there is a sanctioned plan for this Kaveri building
and whether completion certificate has been issued. Mr. Mor further submitted that the building
Kaveri does not have a sanctioned plan which has currency today and it does not have a completion
certificate and hence legally no one can stay there.
Submission by learned Counsel for the opposite parties:
12. Senior Counsel for the O.Ps., Dr. J.C. Batra submitted that husband and wife bought two sets of
flats wherein the husband has sold his flat to Mr. B.S. Mor, Advocate, AM-165, Shalimar Bagh, New
Delhi. Mr. Mor did not apply for mutation and did not pay arrears. He has filed general power of
attorney which has been executed abroad but this has to be registered within three weeks before a
Collector of Stamps in India, otherwise it is invalid. Letter of the complainant talks about two flats.
He is not a consumer at all. He is only a purchaser or power of attorney of the consumer and he
cannot file any complaint. He submitted that general power of attorney does not make Mr. Mor a
consumer. It only authorizes him to sell/transfer the said property to any other person, to apply and
take conveyance deed/sale deed, get electricity connection, etc. but it does not authorize him to file a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1784441/ 3Yash Pal Marwaha vs Pushpa Builders Ltd. And Anr. on 5 September, 2005
consumer complaint.
13. Mr. Batra quoted a judgment of the National Commission. He read the first head-note in II
(2002) CPJ 83 (NC), Pushpa Builders Flat Buyers Association v. Pushpa Builders Ltd., O.P. Nos. 215
of 1996 and326/200C decided on 28.9.2000 and said that the complaint is barred by limitation. If
he became the c wrier in 1999 how can he file original complaint in 2003? flats were taken
possession of in 1992 and complaint under Consumer Protection Act was filed in 2003. As far as the
dispute regarding ma intenance charges is concerned, arbitration proceedings are already pending
and in which Mr. Mor is actively participating and making submissions, filing documents, etc.
Hence he cannot opt for two remedies simultaneously. He quoted the letter dated 6th September,
2002 of the Sole Arbitrator addressed to Shri Yashpal Marwah through Attorney, Shri Balbir Singh
Mor informing him about granting opportunity to file reply on or before the next date of hearing on
20.9.2002 at 4.00 p.m. He concluded by submitting that the complainant cannot have three
remedies: (a) criminal complaint; (b) arbitration; and (c) under Consumer Protection Act.
Findings:
(a) The first issue before us is that the possession of the flat was taken by the complainant as long
back as 1992 so how can he file a complaint more than a decade later? There are two causes of action
which are clear in this case:
(i) The cause of action that arose on 25/28.2.2000 when the opposite party admitted the deficiency
of service on their part and promised to rectify the same at the shortest time but not done, Hence,
the cause of action is a continuous one and still subsisting.
(ii) Further the latest cause of action arose on 20.4.2002 when the builder terminated the sale
agreement itself.
This was also answered by Mr. Mor stating that cause of action is a continuous one as the building
has not been completed and it is not possible for the complainant or his power of attorney to reside
there as is evident from the response from the G.D.A.
Mr. Mor had written a letter on 13.4.2004 to the Vice-chairman, Ghaziabad Development Authority,
(G.D.A.) requesting it to'clarify the following:
(1) Whether M/s. Pushpa Builders Ltd. gave a notice in writing regarding the completion of the
developments of Pusha Aakash Apartments according to the approved plan to obtain a completion
certificate from you? If yes, whether the completion certificate has been issued to M/s. Pushpa
Builders Ltd.?
(2) Whether the allottees of the flats in the building can authorisedly live in/stay?
(3) Whether sanction plan of the building is still valid or expired?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1784441/ 4Yash Pal Marwaha vs Pushpa Builders Ltd. And Anr. on 5 September, 2005
G.D.A. replied on 10.6.205 as follows:
Please refer to your letter dated 13.4.2005 addressed to the Vice-Chairman, Ghaziabad Development
Authority, Map of M/s. Pushpa Builders was sanctioned by the Authority on certain Khasra
numbers of village Hasanpur Bhawapur. The desired informations relating to the map are as under:
(1) The application for the completion certificate on the aforesaid sanctioned map has not yet been
submitted by the builder.
(2) Prior to the issuance of the completion certificate of construction, the occupancy in the building
is not permissible.
(3) The aforesaid map of the building was sanctioned on 21.5.1989 which was sanctioned for three
years.
It is crystal clear from this response that the map of the building was sanctioned on 25.5.1989 but
sanction was not renewed after three years. Completion certificate of construction has not been
submitted by the builder hence occupancy is not permissible.
Apart from the aforesaid aspect it is proved on record that the building is still not completed and
made inhabitable. For this purpose, the complainant has rightly relied upon the previous litigation
by the other two flat allottees as well as the report submitted by the Local Commissioner, Mr. D.P.
Gupta in the two proceedings on Original Petition No. 60 of 1994 and also by the High Court in
Company Petition No. 120 of 1994. ' Hence "the cause of action, in the facts of the present case is
continuous. Accordingly the complaint is not time-barred.
(b) The next issue to be decided is whether the complainant can approach Consumer For when he
has already filed a complaint before the police. The complainant did approach the Police Authorities
because he was pressurized to pay the maintenance charges for an incomplete building and this
issue was sorted, out by them can be seen, from the following extracts of the statement recorded
before the Sub-Inspector, Kalkaji, which is reproduced below:
Mr. V.K. Soin was given the complainant and after going through the complaint he admitted that he
had defaulted as per agreement and made assurance to his clients, as to he could not make Krishna
tower owning to own personal problem and involvement in a serious case. Mr. V.K. Soin also
admitted that he shall compensate the applicant by providing another house and remit the balance
amount which will occur as a difference between KRISHNA and KAVERI Appt. Since Kaveri flats
are provided to Indians at a lower cost he also promised that he shall charge maintenance and other
expenses of his physical occupation and will also charge 50% maintenance in future.
SHO, Kalkaji has endorsed on this document in the following words:
I have gone through the report submitted by S.I. V.K. Sharma and heard the parties concerned in
detail. Both the parties have reconciled their matter mutually and amicably, Therefore, no police
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1784441/ 5Yash Pal Marwaha vs Pushpa Builders Ltd. And Anr. on 5 September, 2005
action is required.
This was finalized on 25.2.2000. Further there is no bar to pursue a remedy under the Consumer
Protection Act in any case wherein the complainant had approached the Police Authorities for a
temporary relief.
(c) The third issue to be decided is whether pending arbitration proceeding is a bar for entertaining
a consumer complaint?
Arbitration proceedings were initiated by the Opposite Party, that too with regard to maintenance
charges only. As against this, the present complaint is filed for refund of the entire amount paid by
the complainant with interest, compensation and cost. The cause of action in both the proceedings,
is entirely different. Hence, the contention that because the arbitration proceedings are pending,
there is a bar for entertaining this complaint is without any substance.
In any case, Section 3 of the Consumer Protection Act, makes the position clear. It reads thus:
The provisions of this Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of the provisions of any other
law for the time being in force.
Supreme Court in the case of Fair Air Engineers Pvt. Ltd. and Anr. v. N.K.
Modi reported in II (1996) CPJ 13 (SC) : (1996) 6 SCC, 384 (Civil Appeal No. 11459 of 1996), decided
on August 20,1996, held that "though the District Forum, State Commission and National
Commission are judicial authorities, for the purpose of Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, in view of
the object of the Act and by operation of Section 3 thereof, we are of the considered view that it
would be appropriate that these forums created under the Act are at liberty to proceed with the
matters in accordance with the provision of the Act rather than relegating the parties to an
arbitration proceedings pursuant to a contract entered into between the parties. The reason is that
the Act intends to relieve the consumers of the cumbersome arbitration proceedings or civil action
unless the forums on their own and on the peculiar facts and circumstances of a particular case,
come to the conclusion that the appropriate forum for adjudication of the disputes would be
otherwise than those given in the Act.
(d) A connected issue raised by learned Senior Counsel, Dr. Batra is that Mr. Mor has no authority
to file a complaint before the Consumer Fora. It is useful in this connection to go through the
following paragraph of the general power of attorney signed by Shri Yash Pal Marwah on 8.10.2002:
To look after, superintend, protect my legal rights and interest in the said property and to
file/defend all kinds of suits, appeals, complaints, applications, etc. and to verify the pleading; to
compromise and compound the same, to appear herself as an advocate and to engage any pleader,
lawyer and advocate, to represent me at all stages in all judicial/quasi-judicial proceedings and in all
Courts -- Civil/Criminal, etc., to submit written replies, counter affidavits, counter claims, to submit
application for execution of decree and to do all other acts, deeds and things in connection thereto
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1784441/ 6Yash Pal Marwaha vs Pushpa Builders Ltd. And Anr. on 5 September, 2005
and to appoint any other attorney and to delegate power to him....
It is clear from the above that Mr-Mor had authority to file this complaint.
Further, Mr, Mor produced records to show that GPA has been registered in India.
(e) The next question to be decided is. whether there was deficiency in service on the part of the
builder? It is clear from the records of the case and the submissions made by the learned Counsel
that undisputedly the complainant had booked a flat in his name in Krishna Apartments in Pushpa
Aakash Apartments after going through attractive brochures and advertisements. A perusal of the
brochures indicates the following:
A Non Resident Indian's Dream:
Details of the Project
4. multistoreyed buildings in which the first Block will be exclusively planned for NRIs comprising
21 floors with 224 Apartments. You will be having a choice of 2 Bed Rooms, 3 Bed Rooms, 4 Bed

system The complainant, an NRI, was asked to pay the money for the flat in instalments which he
has complied with. Copies of the receipts have been produced before us and are in the paper book
which have not been disputed by the learned Counsel for the builder. Mr. Mor has a legal power of
attorney to pursue the case as per the records submitted before us. The Krishna Apartments was not
built at all. Instead, complainant was offered a flat in Kaveri Apartments which is inferior to
'Krishna'. The complainant through his Solicitor at London protested against this. As there was
information that builder was arrested on a murder charge, the complainant to save his hard earned
money accepted the allotment of a flat in 'Kaveri' and took technical possession of the same though
it was not complete. Hence, we conclude that there is clearly a deficiency of service on the part of the
builder.
(f) Some other purchasers of the flats in the same apartments built by the same builder had
approached this Commission in Original Petition No. 215/1996 -- Pitshpa Builders Flat Buyers
Association v. Pitshpa Builders Ltd. (supra), wherein this Commission observed as under:
Even otherwise, flats were to be developed in 1991, they were not ready as late as 1995. We have also
on record O.P. 326/2000 wherein a report from a Commission in this case appointed by the
Company Judge to ascertain the status of flats is quite revealing. There is scaffolding on site, work is
going on in upper floors, dampness was noticed on the walls of bed rooms, etc. until repairs were
carried out any permanent remedial measure are taken, it cannot be considered habitable. He has
concluded in the absence of basic facilities of electricity, sewage and lift as also because of dampness
observed in the flats, it is difficult to expect the flat owners to inhabit in the residential complex at
present. This report is of as late as November 24,1999. We see a continued cause of action. We are
even otherwise inclined to condone the delay, if any, keeping in view the facts and circumstances of
the case. We also find the ground to be untenable.
Therefore, this Commission in the above case, finally observed as under:
In the light of discussion above, we find a clear deficiency on the part of respondent in rendering
service to the complainants. The complaint is allowed. The respondent is directed to refund amount
deposited by each of the fifteen flat purchasers along with rate of interest @ 18% from the respective
dates of payment till the repayment is made within a period of three months.
15. Earlier in Original Petition No. 60/1994--Pushpa Bnilders Flat Buyers Association v. Pitshpa
Builders Ltd. and Ors. II (1996) CPJ 212 (NC), for the same apartment similar observation and
reliefs were granted.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1784441/ 8Yash Pal Marwaha vs Pushpa Builders Ltd. And Anr. on 5 September, 2005
16. These orders have become final, and there is no reason to take a different view. The reason being
purchase of flat today would be much more higher than the rate prevailing in 1989, and the rate of
interest would take care of compensation awardable in such cases of unjustifiable breach of contract.
17. In this case, the complainant was living abroad. He was not a member of Pushpa Builders Flat
Buyers Association. The complainant has only taken technical possession of the incomplete
building. That the building is incomplete has been certified by the Local Commissioner, Shri D.P.
Gupta, Retired Director General, Road Development, Ministry of Surface Transport. Sanctioned
plan of the building had expired and the builder had not secured renewal of the plan from the
Competent Authority, i.e. GDA and he has not submitted completion certificate.
18. Therefore, we arrive at the conclusion that a gullible NRI has been lured to buy a flat in an
apartment exclusively meant for NRIs through grandiose advertisements and brochures but the
builder failed to build the same and allotted him an alternative inferior flat which he accepted under
mental duress. Therefore, he is entitled to refund of the amount equivalent in Indian rupees from
the date of deposit with 12% interest till the date of payment. Accordingly, the builder is directed to
pay rupee equivalent of $ 44, 156 from the dates of deposit with 12% interest till date of payment.
The complainant shall hand over the possession of the Flat in question to the opposite party No. 1.
We also order cost assessed at Rs. 25,000 to be paid to the complainant by the respondent No. 1.
The original complaint is allowed accordingly.
