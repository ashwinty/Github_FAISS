JUDGMENT
The Appellant/Respondent/Defendant has filed this Second Appeal as against the Judgment and
Decree dated 23.08.1995 in A.S.No.6 of 1994 on the file of Subordinate Court, Poonamallee.
2.The First Appellate Court viz., the Learned Subordinate Judge, Poonamallee, while passing the
Judgment in A.S.No.6 of 1994, dated 23.08.1995 has among other things observed that 'the
Appellant/ Respondent/Defendant has to vacate the land in question and that the
Respondent/Appellant/Plaintiff is entitled to the recovery of the possession since the
Appellant/Respondent/Defendant has made improvements by way of putting the superstructure on
the land in question and that the Respondent/Appellant/Plaintiff has to pay the value of the house
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1319311/ 1Vijayalakshmi vs Sulochana (Deceased) on 7 October, 2010
to the Appellant/Respondent/Defendant etc., and moreover, opined that the
Respondent/Appellant/Plaintiff is entitled to the relief of declaration of the suit property and that
she is entitled to the recovery of the possession and further directed the Respondent/
Appellant/Plaintiff to pay the compensation for the superstructure besides directing him to deposit
into the Court below the value of the building as on date of filing of Execution Proceedings and take
possession of the suit site as well as the building and thereby allowed the Appeal and dismissed the
Cross Appeal.'
3.Before the trial Court, in the main suit 1 to 4 Issues have been framed for adjudication.
4.On the side of the Respondent/Appellant/Plaintiff witness PW1 has been examined and Ex.A.1 to
Ex.A.5 have been marked. On the side of the Appellant/Respondent/Defendant witness DW1 has
been examined and Ex.B.1 to Ex.B.22 have been marked.
5.The trial Court on an appreciation of oral and documentary evidence on record has come to the
resultant conclusion that the Appellant/Defendant has to pay a sum of Rs.12,000/-being the suit
vacant land value from the date of Plaint till date of passing of the Decree together with interest
@24% per annum and accordingly decreed the suit without costs and has also granted two months
time for payment of the amount.
6.Being dissatisfied with the Judgment and Decree passed by the First Appellate Court viz., the
Learned Subordinate Judge, Poonamallee dated 23.08.1995 in A.S.No.6 of 1994, the Appellant/
Respondent/Defendant has preferred this Second Appeal before this Court.
7.At the time of the admission of the Second Appeal, this Court has framed the following substantial
questions of law.
"(1)Whether the Appellant being a transferee having effected improvements on the
suit property in good faith is entitled to the choice of paying the land value to the
respondent in terms of Section 51 of Transfer of Property Act?.
(2)Whether the provisions of Section 51 of Transfer of Property Act is different from
the plea of Equitable Estoppel?.
8. The Contentions, Discussions and Findings on Point Nos.1 and 2:
According to the Learned Counsel for the Appellant/Respondent/ Defendant, the
First Appellate Court viz., the Learned Subordinate Judge, Poonamallee has failed to
see that the Appellant/Defendant has investigated the title and that he has applied
for Encumbrance Certificate for the period from 1965 to 1984 as per Ex.B.17 to
Ex.B.20 and the earlier Encumbrance Certificate has not revealed any subsisting
encumbrance and moreover, the evidentiary value of Ex.B.2 Sale Deed dated
28.01.1980 and Ex.B.3 Ratification Deed dated 09.04.1981 have not been appreciated
by the First Appellate Court.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1319311/ 2Vijayalakshmi vs Sulochana (Deceased) on 7 October, 2010
9.Advancing his arguments, the Learned Counsel for the Appellant/defendant submits that Ex.B.2,
Ex.B.13 and Ex.B.17 to Ex.B.20 has led to the Advocate offering an opinion certifying the title of the
vendor of the Appellant to the suit property in Ex.B.21 and this aspect of the matter has not been
adverted to the First Appellate Court in a proper perspective and in reality it should have held that
the Appellant/Defendant has purchased the property in good faith and that apart, the
Appellant/Defendant has put up constructions and made improvements on the suit property and
incurred huge debts to effect such improvements, but, this aspect has not been looked into by the
First Appellate Court in a real perspective.
10.The contention of the Learned Counsel for the Appellant/Defendant is that the
Appellant/Defendant will incur an irreparable loss if she is required to sell the improvements made
by her in the property because of the fact she has incurred heavy expenses and on the other hand, no
prejudice will be caused to the Respondent/Appellant/Plaintiff if the cost of the land is to pay to her.
11.Proceeding further, it is the contention of the Learned Counsel for the Appellant/Defendant that
the First Appellate Court has considered the claim of the Appellant/Defendant in terms of Equitable
Estoppel and not as per the Section 51 of the Transfer of Property Act and in regard to the choice
and value of the land in any event, the First Appellate Court ought to have applied the ingredients of
Section 51 of the Transfer of Property Act and sustained the Judgement and Decree of the trial Court
passed in the main suit.
12.In short, the Learned Counsel for the Appellant/Respondent/ Defendant projects the plea that
the First Appellate Court has not taken into the relevant attendant facts and circumstances of the
case in a realistic way and therefore prays for allowing the Appeal in the interest of justice.
13.Per contra, the Learned Counsel for the Respondents 2 to 8 (LRs of the deceased Plaintiff)
submits that the First Appellate Court has considered the oral and documentary evidence available
on record and on an appreciation of the entire gamut of the matter in a cumulative manner has
come to a Fair, Just and Equitable conclusion in allowing the Appeal filed by the
Respondent/Plaintiff/Appellant and the same need not be interfered with by this Court at this stage
of the Second Appeal.
14.In the Plaint filed by the Respondent/Appellant/Plaintiff, at Paragraphs 3 and 4, it is averred as
follows:
"3.The plaintiff herein is the owner of a plot more particularly described in the
schedule hereunder. The plaintiff has purchased the suit mentioned plot for a
valuable consideration from one K.B.Padmanabhan, sole proprietor of
M/s.Vijayalakshmi and Company under the registered sale deed dated 10.08.1966.
Ever since the date of purchase the plaintiff had been in possession and enjoyment of
the property in her own right.
4.The plaintiff is a resident of Pattabhiram Village, which is about 10 miles away from
the suit property. Taking advantage of the same, defendant herein had trespassed
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1319311/ 3Vijayalakshmi vs Sulochana (Deceased) on 7 October, 2010
into the suit mentioned site probably during the month of January 1983 and began to
raise constructions over the same."
15.Further, it is the case of the Respondent/Plaintiff that her husband during the month of April
1983 has come to know about the trespass when he has inspected the site and objected to the raising
of constructions. But, the Appellant/Defendant's husband has promised to make arrangements but
has been evading and that he has informed the Respondent/Plaintiff that he has purchased the same
plot from one Murugan as per Sale Deed dated 28.01.1980 and as a matter of fact, the
Appellant/Defendant's Vendor has no right, title or interest to convey the property to the Appellant
and that the said Sale Deed is a fraudulent one.
16.The core contention of the Respondent/Plaintiff is that she has purchased the suit site as early as
in the year 1966 and no one can convey the same to the Appellant/Defendant and further that, any
amount of loan obtained by the Appellant/Defendant for construction will not justify the raising of
constructions on the suit property by trespassing on it.
17.The Respondent/Plaintiff in the main suit has prayed for the relief of a declaration of her title to
the suit property and for vacant possession of the suit plot from the Appellant/Defendant.
18.The stand of the Appellant/Defendant is that she has purchased the suit property by means of
Ex.B.2 Sale Deed dated 28.01.1980 and that she has been in possession and enjoyment of the same
without interruption from any one and that she has been employed with the Corporation of Madras
and she applied for housing loan and has submitted a flawless legal opinion from the Government
Pleader and that she has submitted Encumbrance Certificate from the year 1965 to 1979 to the
Corporation of Madras which do not disclose any encumbrance over the suit property and further,
she has applied for permission before the Ambattur Municipal Township for construction of a
building and the same has been sanctioned in B.P.G.No.223 of 81, dated 28.04.1981 which has been
confirmed by the Madras Metropolitan Development Authority and the Corporation has sanctioned
the loan to her for the construction of the building and that the building has been completed in the
year 1992 which is assessed to property tax.
19.Continuing further, the plea put forward on the side of the Appellant/Defendant is that she being
a bonafide purchaser of the suit property having obtained from the loan etc., has constructed the
building with the full knowledge of the Respondent/Plaintiff and as such she is not entitled to get
the relief of declaration as prayed for in the Plaint.
20.In the Additional Written statement filed by the Appellant/Defendant before the trial Court, the
Appellant has pleaded that as per Section 51 of the Transfer of Property Act, the
Respondent/Plaintiff can be compensated only as the Appellant/Defendant has put up construction
by spending an amount of Rs.1,50,000/- and as on date the market value would be easily about
Rs.3,00,000/- and the Appellant/Defendant's superstructure cannot be demolished. But, the
Respondent/Plaintiff is entitled to the compensation only in respect of the land as on date of Plaint,
which has been valued at Rs.12,600/- and that the Ameen of the trial Court has noted the building
in the suit property.

21.The Evidence of PW1 (husband of Respondent/plaintiff) is to the effect that his wife has
purchased the suit plot from one K.B.Padmanabhan and that they have taken possession of the
property and has been enjoying the same by putting fence and he has put gate on one side and
around the property he has raised a wire fence and in four corners of the property he has kept a
white stone at the height of six feet and the distance between the suit property and his residence
from Pattabhiram is at 15 KM and he used to personally inspect the property once in two or three
months and during the early year of 1983, he has seen someone has encroached upon the suit
property and has come to know that the Appellant/Defendant has encroached upon the same and
when he has seen the suit property, at the time, a foundation has been raised, for which he has
raised his objection and that the Appellant/Defendant's husband informed him that you will stop
the construction and further informed him one Padmanabhan and Murugan has sold the property to
him in the year 1980.
22.It is the only evidence of PW1 that Murugan has no right to sell the property and for a week the
Appellant/Defendant's husband has stopped the construction though he has informed him to
remove the material, but the has not removed the same.
23.It is the evidence of PW1 (in cross examination) that the Appellant/Defendant has finished the
construction of the building only after his wife has filed the case and that his wife has purchased the
property in the year 1966.
24.The Appellant/Defendant as DW1 in an evidence has deposed that Ex.B1 is the Agreement of the
Sale dated 16.12.1979 and at the time of entering into agreement, the place remained vacant and in
the year 1980, she has purchased the property as per Ex.B.2 Sale Deed dated 28.01.1980, Ex.B.3
Ratification Deed dated 09.04.1981 and Ex.B.4 Panchayat permission order dated 28.04.1981 and
she has finished the construction in the suit property, during the year 1982.
25.Further, DW1 in her cross examination has stated that she has presently to know about the
purchase of the suit property by the Respondent/Plaintiff as per Ex.A1 Sale Deed dated 10.08.1966
and she has purchased the property by paying a sale consideration of Rs.4,000/- and at the time,
she has not enquired about the encumbrance in respect of the property and Murugan has sold the
property to her, who is the owner as a legal heir.
26.It is the contention of the Learned Counsel for the Appellant/Defendant that the
Respondent/Plaintiff for 6 or 7 months has not objected to the putting up of construction after
issuance of notice and further has allowed the Appellant/Defendant to proceed with the
construction and upto the raising of foundation, the husband of the Respondent/Defendant PW1
has seen the same and as such the Appellant/Defendant is entitled to the 'plea of Estoppel'.
27.Also, the Learned counsel for the Appellant/Defendant submits that if the Appellant/Defendant
is not entitled to claim the relief under Section 115 of the Evidence Act, then, she is to get the
benefits under Section 51 of the Transfer of Property Act, which is an equitable remedy pertaining to
compensation for the improvement so made.

28.According to the Learned Counsel for the Appellant/Defendant, the Respondent/Plaintiff is no
more and her legal heirs have been impleaded as R2 to R8 in the Second Appeal and further, the
Appellant is 75 years old and she has been in occupation of the property for more than 27 years and
at this stage, requiring to accept the value of the superstructure in a great injustice.
29.Countering the submissions of the Learned Counsel for the Appellant, it is the contention of the
Learned Counsel for the Respondents 2 to 8 (LRs of the deceased First Respondent/Plaintiff) that
PW1 being the husband of the deceased plaintiff, is a competent witness to adduce evidence before
the trial Court as per Section 120 of the Indian Evidence Act and Ex.B.3 is the Ratification Deed and
the Appellant/Defendant being a subsequent purchaser, who has purchased the plot and put up a
construction in a small portion on a larger area is not entitled to take away the entire land and that
Estoppel is the theory of equity and the large extent of land is 3600 sq.ft in Plot No.72 and the
corner of a plot and the construction has been made to a small portion of 600 sq.ft in the corner of a
plot and the Appellant/Defendant cannot claim equity, ignoring the case and the title of the first
Respondent/Plaintiff (since deceased) and a Court of Law cannot give the clean chit to the
Appellant/Defendant being a second purchaser and indeed, Section 51 of the Transfer of Property
Act will alone apply and not Section 115 of the Indian Evidence Act.
30.Added further, it is the submission of the Learned Counsel for the Respondents that the First
Respondent/Plaintiff (since deceased) being a prior purchaser has a better title and the right of
subsequent purchaser is to have a value of improvement estimated and paid by the earlier purchaser
and the preference has to be given only to the purchase made by the First Respondent/Plaintiff
(since deceased) and not the second purchaser viz., Appellant/Defendant and that the
Appellant/Defendant's address is different from the address of the suit at Ambattur and therefore,
the Appellant could not be contacted and because of the different address more silence on the part
of the First Respondent/Plaintiff (since deceased) is not Equitable Estoppel.
31.The pith and substance of the contention of the Learned Counsel for the Respondents 2 to 8 is
that the Appellant/Defendant wants to take away the entire land and the Appellant/Second
purchaser who has no title to the suit property is in the possession of the trespasser and only if the
Appellant/Defendant has applied for an encumbrance in the entire lay out, then only the
encumbrance will reflect the true state of affairs and in the instant case, the Appellant/Defendant
has not applied for Encumbrance Certificate in respect of the entire lay out and the owner of the
land has to pay a compensation to the owner of the building for improvement made and
compensation to be paid by the Respondents/Plaintiffs will have to be determined at the time of
eviction proceedings and the value of building has not yet been decided.
32.At this stage, the Learned Counsel for the Appellant cites the decision of the Honourable
Supreme Court B.L.Sreedhar and Others v. K.M.Munireddy (dead) and Others, (2003) 2 Supreme
Court Cases 355, at Page 356 and 357, wherein it is laid down as follows:
"Estoppel is a rule of evidence and the general rule is enacted in Section 115 of the
Evidence act, 1872 which lays down that when one person has by his declaration, act
or omission cause or permitted another person to believe a thing to be true and to act
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1319311/ 6Vijayalakshmi vs Sulochana (Deceased) on 7 October, 2010
upon that belief, neither he nor his representative shall be allowed in any suit or
proceeding between himself and such person or his representative to deny the truth
of that things.
On the whole, an estoppel seems to be when, in consequence of some previous act or
statement to which he is either party or privy, a person is precluded from showing the
existence of a particular state of facts. Estoppel is based on the maxim allegans
contraria non est audiendus (a party is not to be heard to allege the contrary) and is
that species of presumption juries et de jure (absolute or conclusive or irrebuttable
presumption), where the fact presumed is taken to be true, not as against all the
world, but against a particular party, and that only by reason of some act done, it is in
truth a kind of argumentum ad hominem.
Though estoppel is described as a mere rule of evidence, it may have the effect of
creating substantive rights as against the person estopped. An estoppel which enables
a party as against another party to claim a right of property which in fact he does not
possess is described as estoppel by negligence or by conduct or by representation or
by holding out ostensible authority.
Estoppel, then, may itself be the foundation of a right as against the person estopped,
otherwise the principle of estoppel would not afford any protection to the person by
whom it may be invoked nor would it create any disability in the person against
whom it operates in cases affecting rights. Where rights are involved, estoppel may
with equal justification be described both as a rule of evidence and as a rule creating
or defeating rights.
An estoppel cannot have the effect of conferring upon a person a legal status
expressly denied to him by a statute. But where such is not the case a right may be
claimed as having come into existence on the basis of estoppel and it is capable of
being enforced or defended as against the person precluded from denying it.
If a man either by words or by conduct has intimated that he consents to an act which
has been done and that he will not offer any opposition to it, although it could not
have been lawfully done without his consent, and he thereby induces others to do that
which they otherwise might have abstained from, he cannot question the legality of
the act he had sanctioned to the prejudice of those who have so given faith to his
words or to the fair inference to be drawn from his conduct."
33.He also relies on the decision M.A.Raju v. Annaiah and Others, AIR 2003 Karnataka 497,
wherein it is held that 'Merely because party has not specifically coined phrase 'Doctrine of estoppel'
as defence, it would be wrong to overlook true legal effect of defence etc.'
34.However, the Learned Counsel for the Respondents cites the decision of this Court
M.Ramalingam v. N.Thangavelu 1997-2-L.W. 35, wherein it is held that 'Mere silence by itself will
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1319311/ 7Vijayalakshmi vs Sulochana (Deceased) on 7 October, 2010
not amount to representation unless a duty is cast on plaintiff to speak about the limits, and if so,
plaintiff must be made aware of the limits of the property.'
35.He seeks in aid of the decision of this Court K.S.Chidambaram v. Gomathi Ammal and Others
1996 (II) MLJ 59, wherein it is held thus:
"Acquiescence imports not only full knowledge of facts, which will enable the parties
to the factual and actual action, but also wilful shutting of his eyes and the positive
inaction tantamounting to an implied consent. It would not be that laches alone, even
if proved to exist could be raised to the level of acquiescence, inasmuch as the
acquiescence imports active assent in contrast to laches which can be passive or
indifference. Acquiescence is often construed and held to be an instance of law of
estoppel by words or conduct."
36.Yet another decision of this Court is relied on the side of the Respondents Rama Aiyar and others
v. Narayanasami Aiyar and others AIR 1926 Madras 609, wherein it is observed as follows:
"Bona fides is not incompatible with ignorance of law, nor is it incompatible with a
certain degree of negligence. The degree of negligence is, of course, a matter to be
determined according to the circumstances of each case."
37.The Learned Counsel for the Respondents invites the attention of this Court to the decision
Periakaruppan alias Palani, minor through his cousin sister and guardian Karuppayee and Others v.
Madura Kajimartheru Pallivasal through its Managing Trustee and another 1937 The Madras
Weekly Notes 533, wherein it is held as follows:
"If land is waste land then is not necessary for its owner to do anything more than to
prove that the land belongs to him and it is not necessary to support his case by
evidence of overt acts of possession, which would really be inconsistent with the
nature of the land. He need only prove such possession as the property is capable of;
and that done, in the absence of any proof as to entry by some other person on the
land beyond the twelve years period, the owner in entitled to succeed.
(ii)that the defendants being trespassers were not entitled to compensation under
Section 51 of the Transfer of Property Act."
38.Apart from the above, the Learned Counsel for the Respondents cites the following decisions:
(a)In the decision of Honourable Supreme Court J.Narayana Rao v.
Y.G.Basavarayappa and others 1956 Supreme Court 727, wherein it is held
hereunder:
"Section 51 merely lays down an equitable principle and enables a Court to determine
the equities between the parties. A decree in the form in which it had been passed in
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1319311/ 8Vijayalakshmi vs Sulochana (Deceased) on 7 October, 2010
this case, which was a suit for redemption and possession could have been passed.
However, having regard to the provisions of Section 51 if the evidence enables a Court
to do so, it should assess the valuation of the improvement as at a date as near as
possible to the date of actual eviction rather than the dater of election as had been
done in this case."
(b)In Daya Ram and Others v. Shyam Sundari and others AIR 1965 Supreme Court 1049, at Page
1051 and 1052 in Paragraphs 7 and 8, it is inter-alia observed as follows:
7.The ground upon which the learned trial Judge considered that the defendants
were entitled to this equity was that Mata Din had made the constructions on the
land, being obliged to do so by reason of the agreement with the Trust and that he
effected these improvements as a Co-owner and not as trespaser and that in entering
into an agreement with the Trust he did not act mala fide but to save the land in
dispute for himself and his co-owners from being acquired by the Trust and that as
Shyam Sundari did not assert her title before the construction started it would not be
equitable to permit her to obtain a share in the land on which the new constructions
stood and that it was within the jurisdiction of the court trying a partition suit to
transfer to co-sharers at its market price the share of others instead of dividing the
property and that as it was impracticable to divide the property without demolishing
some at least of the constructions, the defendants were entitled to insist that they
should be permitted to purchase the third share of Shyam Sundari in the vacant land.
In reversing this Judgement, the learned Judges of the High Court held that the
action of Mata Din in purchasing the property was not bona fide. Mata Din had put
forward, in the previous litigation-suit 20 of 1922 a defence based on S.41 of the
Transfer of Property Act and in that he failed. The agreement with the Trust was on
December 15, 1921 and Shyam Sundari's suit 20 of 1922 was filed in March 1922. it
was, therefore, clear that whether or not the constructions were commenced before
the suit was instituted, they were completed with knowledge of the claim of Shyam
Sundari to which, as the courts have not found, he had no defence. The agreement
with the Trust could not justify Mata Din's action because the Trust could not agree
with a person who was not the owner of the property to construct buildings on
another's property. It would have been open to Mata Din to have informed the Trust
immediately he got notice of the claim of Shyam Sundari that only a 2/3rd share in
the site belongs to him, but he did not do so but completed the constructions ignoring
the claims of Shyam Sundari. They could not therefore take advantage of their own
acts and conduct and plead an equity based upon their wrongful acts. On this line of
reasoning the learned Judges held that there was no equity in favour of Mata Din and
his heirs and hence passed a decree in favour of Shyam Sundari in the terms we have
extracted earlier.
8.Learned Counsel for the appellants, though he referred to the Partition act, could
not obviously rely upon it because the procedure adopted by the learned trial Judge
was not one which was sanctioned by that enactment, viz., sale of the entire property
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1319311/ 9Vijayalakshmi vs Sulochana (Deceased) on 7 October, 2010
which is the subject of partition. He, therefore, urged before us that at the stage when
Mata Din entered into the agreement with the Improvement Trust the position was
that the interest of the Co-sharers was in jeopardy and they ran the risk of losing the
entire property by the same being acquired under the Land Acquisition Act and that
by his act in entering into the agreement the co-owners had been saved (sic) the
property now in dispute and that, in the circumstances, the agreement was one which
wws entered into bana fide and that he could claim an equity based on the
constructions erected in pursuance thereof. We do not see any substance in this
argument. If the property had been acquired under the Land Acquisition Act
compensation at the market value with the solatium would have been provided
Shyam Sundari would have been entitled to a third share in that compensation. There
is, therefore, no question of Mata Din salvaging something for the co-owners; and on
that ground being entitled to plead an equity based on such an act. Nor is there any
substance in the argument derived from the analogy of improvements effected by
co-owners or co-sharers, for admittedly Mata Din dealt with the property as full
owner denying the claims of Shyam Sundari to a third share in the property. Virtually
it would be seen that the equity pleaded is based on the principle underlying s.51 of
the Transfer of Property Act, and as we have seen, the argument calling in aid this
provision of law had been urged before the High Court in the Appeal against the
decree in suit 20 of 1922 and had been rejected for the reason we have extracted
earlier, and these reasons clearly negative all bona fides in the construction of these
buildings. In these circumstanceswe consider that the learned Judges were justified
in treating the acts of Mata Din as those of a trespasser who, with notice of the claim
of the true owner, had effected constructions on the property. It is obvious that in
those circumstances he could claim no special equity based upon his having bona fide
put common property to use and effect improvements on it. We consider, therefore,
that the decree passed by the High Court is not open to objection and the appeal has
accordingly to fail."
(c)In Kasipathi v. E.Subba Rao Pawer AIR 1961 Mysore 62, at Page 63, it is held as follows:
"Where A is the prior purchases of certain property and has acquired a valid title to it,
a subsequent sale in favour of B of the same property cannot afford the validity of the
sale in favour of A. If B claim to be a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of
the sale in favour of A, and has made any improvements, it is for him to prove that he
is such a bonafide purchaser without notice.
Further, Section 51 leaves the option to the person having better title either to pay the
value of the improvement or to sell his interest to the subsequent purchaser. The
choice is that of the evictor. He is required to sell his interest in the property to the
subsequent purchaser at the then market value."
(d)In R.S.Maddanappa (deceased) after him by his legal representatives v. Chandramma and
another AIR 1965 Supreme Court 1812, it is observed that 'a Person concerned knowing true
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1319311/ 10Vijayalakshmi vs Sulochana (Deceased) on 7 October, 2010
position relating to title in property in his possession cannot plead that he has been induced to hold
erroneous belief by reason of conduct of real owner of that property.
Also, in the aforesaid decision at Page 1813, it is held as follows:
"No man who spends money on improving property, knowing fully well that he has
no title to it can be permitted to deprive the original owner of his right to possession
of the property except upon the payment for the improvements which were not
effected with the consent of that person. The doctrine of acquiescence is of no held to
such a man, for he who knows the true state of affairs cannot say that any mistaken
belief was caused in his mind by reason of what the owner said or did."
(e)In Arjun Lal Gupta and others v. Mriganka Mohan Sur and others AIR 1975 Suspreme Court 207,
at Page 208, the Honourable Supreme Court in Para 4 has held thus:
"4.After having been taken through the pleadings and the relevant facts and findings
in the case, we find ourselves in complete agreement with the view of the trial Court
and the High Court, that neither estoppel nor waiver nor Order 2, Rule 2 Civil P.C.
Could bar the plaintiff's suit. Defendant No.1, who had neither appealed in the High
Court nor is among the appellants before us, had failed to establish its claim that it
had authority from the plaintiff to either use the land for dumping scrap iron or to let
it out to any party as the plaintiff's agent. The defendants-appellants before us relied
mainly on the alleged failure to object to structures made by them for the purpose of
manufacturing buckets and automobile parts. But, these were not shown to be
permanent structures. They were only tin sheds and fittings, which could be and have
been ordered to be removed by the contesting defendants-appellants. The mere fact
that defendants-appellants were trespassers and that the plaintiffs had brought their
suit for eviction in 1955, objecting to trespass, could not confer any right upon the
defendants-appellants, who were said to have been brought on the land by one Shri
Agarwala in 1951. Nothing could be shown to us to enable us to hold that the findings
of the trial Court and the High Court on questions of fact were erroneous. It had been
rightly held that there was no evidence to wsho9w that the plaintiff had in any way
encouraged the defendants to incur any expense or had made any representations to
induce them to change their position to their disadvantage. The plaintiff had asserted
his rights within a reasonable time after learning of the trespass. He did not stand by
watching valuable constructions being put up on his land, but had sent a notice
objecting to the trespass as soon as he learnt of it. The defendants had not shown that
they had acquired any right in the land from an owner. They had, very half-heartedly,
set up a plead of limitation which was not seriously pressed. The whole stand of the
defendants-appellants was lacking in bona fides."
(f)In R.B.Bharatha Charyulu v. R.B.Alivelu Manga Thayaru AIR 1996 Andhra Pradesh 238, at Page
240 it is held that "a husband taking sufficient efforts to acquire land for his wife and was under
impression that land belonged to him and the Rule that "where a husband builds on the land
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1319311/ 11Vijayalakshmi vs Sulochana (Deceased) on 7 October, 2010
belonging to his wife knowing he has no right to do so, the latter is entitled to the building" will not
apply."
(g)Generally a wrong doer cannot claim any compensation for improvement made by him as per
decision Pandara Sannadhi v. Anandha Krishnaswami, Naidu AIR 1939 Madras 247.
(h)The value is not the actual amount spent, but the market value as near as date on eviction as per
decision Ramaji Batanji v. Manohar Chintaman AIR 1961 BOM 169.
39.It is to be noted that the expression 'Believing In Good Faith' means honestly believing as per
decision Chennapragada v. The Secretary of State (1925) 48 Madras Law Journal 682. An honest
belief is not incompatible with negligence.
40.The term 'Good Faith" is defined in the General Clauses act, 1897 as follows:
"A things shall be deemed to be done in 'good faith' where it is in fact done honestly,
whether it is done negligently or not."
41.It is to be borne in mind that a purchaser making improvements with a knowledge that the
property does not belong to him cannot claim the benefit of Section 51 of the Transfer of Property
Act, as per decision State of Jammu and Kashmir v. Ghulam Rasool (1998) Kash.L.J. 260.
42.To invoke the ingredients of Section 51 of Transfer of Property Act the two following conditions
are to be satisfied:
(a)The individual evicted must be a transferee and
(b)he must have made the improvements believing in good faith that he was
absolutely entitled.
43.This Court aptly recalls the decision Natesa Thevan v. District Board of Thanjur AIR 926 Madras
921 wherein 'A purchaser who has been put in possession of a larger area than he was entitled to and
who in ignorance of the mistake made improvements on the excess area' has been given the benefit
of section 51 of the Transfer of Property Act.
44.It is to be pointed out that if persons who come into possession of the land belonging to another
and make improvement thereon on the bonafide belief that they are entitled to make such
improvements are entitled to claim compensation for the improvements made by them as per
decision Raman Ittiyathi v.Pappy Bhaskaran AIR 1990 Kerala 113 (122).
45.It is worth by this Court to state that Section 41 of the Transfer of Property Act leaves the option
to an individual possessing a better title either to pay the value of improvements or to sell his
interest in subsequent purchaser. The choice is that of the evictor, as opined by this Court.

46.Admittedly, the Transfer of Property Act is not an exhaustive one and it does not exclude any
equitable principle such as may regulate the rights and liabilities of the parties in a case not
specifically provided for by the legislature.
47.Section 51 of the Transfer of Property Act operates only as long as it is clear that the plaintiff has
not done anything to encourage or give an impression to the defendant that he has no objection for
improvement of construction by the defendant. Once such a representation to a larger extent
emanate from the plaintiff, the ingredients of Section 51 of the Transfer of Property Act cease to
operate and Section 115 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 steps in.
48.It is well settled principle of law that there is no estoppel against an illegality or legal
unenforceability.
49.A person who evicts has right of election for one of the two alternatives mentioned in section 51
of the Transfer of Property Act are specified as per decision Nagaratnamba v. Ramayya AIR 1963 AP
177.
50.Be that as it may, as far as the present case is concerned, the First Respondent/Plaintiff (since
deceased) has purchased the house site No.72, Nanja Land measuring 3600 Sq. ft. in Survey
No.102/1 and in 59, Orgadam Village, Sriperumbudur Taluk, Chengalpet District, more particularly
described in the schedule of Ex.A.1 Sale Deed dated 10.08.1966 from one K.B.Padmanabhan, sole
proprietor of M/s.Vijayalakshmi and Company residing at Banu Nagar, near Orgadam Village,
Ambattur, Madras 53 the vendor in Ex.A.1 Sale Deed dated 10.08.1996 viz., K.B.Padmanabhan is
the father of Murugan, sold the suit cite to the Appellant/Defendant as per Ex.B.2 Sale Deed dated
28.01.1980. The same extent of house sites measuring 3600 Sq.ft. In plot No.72 has been sold to the
Appellant/Defendant by M.B.Murugappan S/O. Late K.B.Padmanabhan viz., the Vendor of Ex.A.1
Sale Deed dated 10.08.1966.
51.In the instant case on hand, the son of K.B.Padmanabhan, i.e., K.B.Murugappan, Managing
Proprietor of M/s.Vijayalakshmi and Company has sold the very same property in Ex.A.1 Sale Deed
dated 10.08.1966 to the Appellant/Defendant. Therefore, it is quite candidly clear that the vendor
viz., K.B.Murugappan, S/O.K.B.Padmahabhan in Ex.B.2 Sale Deed dated 28.01.1980 has no legal
authority to execute the Sale Deed in respect of the property already sold, to the
Appellant/Defendant. It is significant for this Court to make a mention that DW1 in her cross
examination has stated that at the time when she has purchased the Ex.B.2 landed property viz., the
suit property for a sum of Rs.4,000/- she has not made enquiry about the encumbrance.
52.On a careful consideration of oral evidence of PW1 (the husband of deceased Plaintiff and also
taking note of the evidence of DW1 (the Appellant/Defendant) coupled with the documentary
evidence available on record and on an overall assessment of the facts and circumstances of the case
in an conspectus fashion this Court comes to an inevitable conclusion that the first Respondent
/Plaintiff (deceased) is the first purchaser as per Ex.A.1 Sale Deed dated 10.08.1966 and the
purchase made by her is a true and valid one in the eye of law, but, at the same time, this Court
opines that the Appellant/Defendant purchased the same property mentioned in the Plaint as per
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1319311/ 13Vijayalakshmi vs Sulochana (Deceased) on 7 October, 2010
Ex.B.2 Sale Deed dated 28.01.2980 is not a legally valid one in the eye of law and therefore the
Appellant/Defendant is directed to hand over the suit land to the Respondents within a period of
three months from the date of passing of this Judgement. Further the Respondents are entitled to
seek the recovery of possession because of the fact that the Appellant/Defendant has made
improvements by raising constructions on the land and the Respondents/Plaintiffs on the basis of
principles of Justice, Equity and Good conscience are directed to pay the value of the house put up
by the Appellant/Defendant in the suit land which is to be determined or fixed on the date of the
respondents projecting an execution petition before the Executing Court and taking possession of
the same with well and building thereto in the manner known to law and in accordance with law and
viewed in this perspective, the Appellant/Defendant is not entitled to avail the benefit or choice in
paying the value to the Respondents as per Section 51 of the Transfer of Property Act and also the
ingredients of Section 51 are quite distinct and different from the plea of Estoppel under Section 115
of Indian Evidence Act and looking at from any point of view the Judgment and Decree of the First
Appellate Court dated 23.08.1995 in A.S.No.6 of 1994 do not suffer from any material irregularity or
patent illegality and consequently the substantial questions of law 1 and 2 are answered against the
Appellant and the Second Appeal fails.
In the result, the Second Appeal is dismissed, leaving the parties to bear their own costs.
Consequently, the Judgment and Decree of the First Appellate Court in A.S.No.6 of 1994, dated
23.08.1995 are affirmed by this Court for the reasons assigned in this Appeal.
