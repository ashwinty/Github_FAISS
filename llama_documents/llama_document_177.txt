JUDGMENT:

The petitioner is an Advocate and a member of the Bar Association of the High Court of Punjab &
Haryana. He filed a Writ Petition in the High Court of Punjab & Haryana challenging the
appointment of Shri M.R.Agnihotri, a former Judge of the Punjab & Haryana High Court as the
President of the Haryana State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission on completion of the
term of Shri S,S.Sandhewalia, a former Chief Justice of the High Court, with effect from June 30,
1994. The challenge was made on the ground that the appointment of Shri M.R.Agnihotri was not in
accordance with Section 16 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and in consonance with the
principles applicable or making such an appointment. That writ petition (C.W.P.No.7067 of 1994)
was transferred to this Court for decision, in view of the importance of the question involved.

The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 prescribes in Section 16 for the composition of the State
Commission as under :

2[Provided that every appointment made under this clause shall be made by the State Government
on the recommendation of a selection committee consisting of the following, namely-

term.]

1. Ommitted by the Consumer Protection (Amendment) Act, 1993 (w.e.f.18th June, 1993).
2. Inserted by ibid".
We are, in this matter concerned, primarily with the requirement of Section 16(1)(a) which
prescribes the mode of appointment of the President of the State Commission.

The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is an Act to provide for better protection of the interests of
consumers and for that purpose to make provision for the establishment of consumer councils and
other authorities for the settlement of consumers' disputes and for matters connected therewith'.
The National Commission, the State Commission and the District Forum are established as the
agencies for the redressal of consumer disputes by Section 9 of the Act. Section 10 of the Act
provides for composition of the District Forum, Section 16 for the State Commission and Section 20
for the National Commission. The scheme is that these three agencies constituted for redressal of
consumer disputes at different levels have as its President a person who is, or has been a Judge at
the corresponding level. This is so because the function of these agencies is primarily the
adjudication of consumer disputes and, therefore, a person from the judicial branch is considered to
be suitable for the office of the President. The appointment to the office of the President of the State
Commission is to be made only after consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court' and to
the office of the President of the National Commission after consultation with the Chief Justice of
India'. Such a provision requiring prior consultation with the Chief Justice is obviously for the
reason that he is the most suitable person to know about the suitability of the person to be
appointed as the President of the Commission. The provisions in Section 16(1)(a) for appointment of
the President of the State Commission and in Section 20(1)(a) for appointment of the President of
the National Commission are in Pari materia and have to be similarly construed. The construction of
the proviso in Section 16(1)(a) and that in Section 20(1)(a) must be the same because of the identity
of the language. The expression after consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court and after
consultation with the Chief Justice of India must be construed in the same manner as the expression
after consultation with the Chief Justice of India, the Chief Justice of the High Court in Article 217 of
the Constitution of India made in Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association and Ors. Vs.
Union of India. (1993(4)SCC 441). Accordingly, the opinion of the Chief Justice of the High Court
and the requirement of consultation with him according to the proviso in Section 16(1)(a) must have
the same status as that of the Chief Justice of the High Court in the appointment of a High Court
Judge under Article 217 of the Constitution of India; and the process of appointment to the office of
the President of the State Commission must also be similar. It is unnecessary to restate the same
which is summarized in the majority opinion in the Judges-II case (supra). This is necessary to
maintain independence of the judiciary and to avoid any possibility of a sitting or a retired Judge
depending on the executive for such an appointment. Our attention was drawn to certain
observations in Sarwan Singh Lamba & Ors. Vs. Union of India & Ors., ((1995)4 SCC 546), to
suggest that the name for appointment to the Administrative Tribunal may be suggested even by the
executive which may have the effect of initiating the proposal. In the facts of that case, substantial
compliance of the requirement of approval by the Chief Justice of India was found proved and,
therefore, the appointments were upheld. The requirement of consultation with the Chief Justice in
the proviso to Section 16(1)(a) and Section 20(1)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act being similar to
that in Article 217, the principles enunciated in the majority opinion in the Judges-II case must
apply, as indicated earlier, even for initiating the proposal. The executive is expected to approach the
Chief Justice when the appointment is to be made for taking the steps to initiate the proposal, and
the procedure followed should be the same as for appointment of a High Court Judge. That would
give greater credibility to the appointment made.

The question now is : whether there has been due compliance of the proviso to Section 16(1)(a) of
the Consumer Protection Act in the present case? The affidavit dated 9th July, 1994 of Shri B.L.
Gulati, Registrar of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana mentions the procedure adopted in making
the appointment of Shri M.R.Agnihotri, a retired Judge of the High Court as the President of the
Haryana State Commission. It is stated that the Chief Justice of the High Court of Punjab & Haryana
considered the names of certain retired Judges of that High Court and ultimately gave his consent
for the appointment of Shri M.R.Agnihotri as the President of the State Commission which was
communicated by the Registrar to the Haryana Government on 10th June, 1994, after which the
appointment of Shri M.R. Agnihotri was made. In the facts of the present case, we find that there
was substantial compliance of the proviso to Section 16(1)(a) of the Act and the appointment of Shri
M.R.Agnihotri was made after consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court. However, we
may add that the appropriate course to adopt, as indicated in the Judges-II case, is for the Chief
Justice of the High Court to initiate the proposal and to mention the name approved by him for
appointment instead of the Chief Justice only approving the name suggested by the State
Government. It appears from the affidavit of the Registrar that the Chief Justice had indicated to the
State Government the proper procedure relating to initiation of the proposal for filling up the post
and he has accorded his approval to the appointment of Shri M,R.Agnihotri only after considering
several names, including that of Shri M.R.Agnihotri. The appointment made in the present case
does not, therefore, call for any interference.
Consequently, the transferred case is dismissed.
