7. On 19th September, 1992, the plaintiff instituted a suit for possession and mesne profits relating
to the suit property on the ground that she had agreed to sell only first and second floors of the suit
property to Mohinder Kaur who has illegally constructed third floor. The plaintiff further averred
that Mohinder Kaur has not obtained the sale permission in terms of the agreement and the period

having purchased from defendant No.1 for a total consideration of `5,50,000/- on the basis of the
agreement to sell, receipt, will, indemnity bond, affidavit, possession letter and Power of Attorneys
all dated 1st September, 1992.
10. The plaintiff appeared in the witness box before the learned Trial Court as PW-1 and reiterated
the averments made in the plaint. PW-1 proved the deed of cancellation of General Power of
Attorney dated 9th March, 1992 as Ex.PW1/A. In cross-examination, the plaintiff made material

(i) The plaintiff admitted Darshan Kaur to be the original owner of the suit property.
(ii) The plaintiff admitted her title on the basis of construction agreement dated 19th
April, 1973 - Ex.PW1/DA in her favour and General Power of Attorney of Darshan

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 4Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
and 3 since defendant No.1 claimed no right, title and interest in the suit property and defendant
Nos.2 and 3, intermeddling with the estate of the deceased, are the legal representatives of
defendant No.1 within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Code of Civil Procedure.
12. On 24th July, 1997, the following issues were framed by the learned Trial Court:-
"1. Whether there exists any cause of action in favour of the plaintiffs to file the
present suit against defendants No.2 and 3?
2. Whether the suit has not been property valued for the purpose of court fees and
jurisdiction?
3. Whether the agreement to sell executed by the plaintiff in favour of defendant No.1
became time barred because of non-
performance of agreement by defendant No.1? If so, to what effect?
4. Whether defendants No.2 and 3 are the lawful owners in possession having
purchased the property from defendant No.1 for a valuable consideration?
5. Whether the plaintiff is the owner of the suit premises?
6. Whether the plaintiff had any right to terminate the registered General power of
Attorney executed in favour of defendant No.1 dated 5th June, 1989? If so, its effect?
7. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to any mesne profits/damages. If so, at what rate?
From whom and for what period?
8. Relief."
13. The Trial Court dismissed the plaintiff(cid:128)s suit. The findings of the Trial Court are as under:-
(i) The plaintiff(cid:128)s claim that she had agreed to sell only first and second floors of the
suit property to defendant No.1 is not correct as the agreement to sell - Ex.PW1/D2/1
dated 5th September, 1989, admitted by the plaintiff, clearly records that the plaintiff
agreed to sell the first, second and terrace floors of the suit property.
(ii) The Power of Attorney dated 5th September, 1989 - Ex.PW1/D2/5 was executed
by the plaintiff for consideration and was, therefore, irrevocable under Section 202 of
the Contract Act, 1872.
(iii) The plaintiff ceased to be the owner of the suit property after 5th June, 1989 as
she received the entire sale consideration of Rs.4,50,000/-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 5Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
from defendant No.1; handed over the vacant and peaceful possession to defendant No.1; declared
defendant No.1 to be the absolute owner of the suit property (clause 11 of the agreement); authorized
defendant No.1 to make construction, additions and alterations (clause 12 of the agreement);
executed the irrevocable General Power of Attorney authorizing the attorney to construct, demolish
or re-construct the building and also authorized him to sell and transfer the suit property.
(iv) The plaintiff(cid:128)s remedy against the unauthorized construction by the defendant is to file a suit
for injunction but she cannot cancel the legal documents executed by her.
(v) The plaintiff(cid:128)s suit was barred by Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and the
plaintiff was estopped from going back on the agreement to sell. The Trial Court relied upon D.R.
Puri v. Kamlesh Sawhney, (2001) 60 DRJ 736 in this regard.
(vi) It is not open to the plaintiff to cancel any document including General Power of Attorney. As
such, the plaintiff has no right to either recover possession or mesne profits from the defendants.
(vii) The agreement to sell has not become time barred as the plaintiff herself has failed to perform
her part of the contract. The question of performance on the part of defendant No.1 would have
arisen only after the plaintiff had performed her part of the contract.
(viii) Defendants No.2 and 3 have right to possess the suit property to the exclusion of all others
including the plaintiff by virtue of the agreement to sell, General Power of Attorney and other
documents dated 1st September, 1992 - Ex.DW1/1 to Ex.DW1/5.
(ix) The plaintiff has no cause of action to file the suit against the defendants including defendants
No.2 and 3 who are successors in interest in defendant No.1.
14. During the pendency of this appeal, vide order dated 1st October, 2010, this Court framed an
additional issue as to whether the sale transaction between the plaintiff and defendant No.1 was
cancelled by the plaintiff and if so, to what effect. The case was remanded back to the Trial Court for
decision on the additional issue. The parties led evidence on the additional issue.
15. The Trial Court has decided the additional issue against the plaintiff. The findings of the Trial
Court on the additional issue are as under:-
(i) The plaintiff had cancelled the General Power of Attorney and will dated 5th June,
1989 but the sale transaction was never cancelled.
(ii) The ground for cancellation that defendant No.1 raised unauthorized construction
was not correct as the plaintiff was well aware and she admitted in cross-examination
that defendant No.1 had sold the suit property to defendants No.2 and 3 who were in
possession.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 6Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
(iii) The plaintiff did not receive any notice of unauthorized construction from any
authority.
(iv) The plaintiff also did not issue any notice of unauthorized construction to
defendant No.1.
(v) The plaintiff has set up a false story of unauthorized construction in the plaint.
16. The learned counsel for the plaintiff has urged only two grounds at the time of hearing of this
appeal which are as under:-
(i) The cancellation of the Power of Attorney on 9 th March, 1992 is not barred by
Section 202 of the Contract Act because the General Power of Attorney dated 5th
June, 1989 was executed without any consideration. The plaintiff has not received
any consideration from the attorney. The General Power of Attorney was executed in
favour of Surinder Jit Singh, son of defendant No.1 whereas the sale agreement
relating to the suit property was in favour of defendant No.1 and the attorney cannot
be said to have any interest in the suit property.
(ii) The agreement to sell does not create any interest in or charge on the suit
property in view of Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882.
17. The plaintiff has not challenged the other findings of the Trial Court mentioned in paras 13 and
15 above.
18. Section 202 of the Contract Act, 1872 Section 202 of the Contract Act, 1872 provides that the
Power of Attorney coupled with interest is irrevocable and cannot be revoked/terminated even upon
the death of the principal.
Section 202 of the Contract Act is reproduced hereunder:-
"SECTION 202. Termination of agency where agent has an interest in
subject-matter:-
Where the agent has himself an interest in the property which forms the
subject-matter of the agency, the agency cannot, in the absence of an express
contract, be terminated to the prejudice of such interest.
Illustrations
(a) A gives authority to B to sell A's land, and to pay himself, out of the proceeds, the
debts due to him from A. A cannot revoke this authority, nor can it be terminated by
his insanity or death.

(b) A consigns 1,000 bales of cotton to B, who has made advances to him on such
cotton, and desires B to sell the cotton, and to repay himself, out of the price, the
amount of his own advances. A cannot revoke this authority, nor it is terminated by
his insanity or death."
(Emphasis supplied)
(i) In Harbans Singh v. Shanti Devi, 1977 RLR 487, the seller had executed an agreement to sell in
favour of the purchaser and the General Power of Attorney in favour of her husband. The General
Power of Attorney was stated to be irrevocable and it authorized the attorney to further sell the
subject property. The seller later cancelled the agreement to sell and all other documents including
the General Power of Attorney. The Trial Court held the General Power of Attorney to be irrevocable
which was challenged in appeal before this Court. The Division Bench of this Court held that the
General Power of Attorney was executed for a valuable consideration and the agent had an interest
in the property and, therefore, the General Power of Attorney was irrevocable.
This Court negatived the seller(cid:128)s contention that a contract of sale „of itself(cid:128) does not create any
interest in or charge on immovable property under Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1988
and, therefore, the purchaser cannot be said to have an interest within the meaning of Section 202
of the Contract Act. It was held that the purchaser had an interest in the immovable property for the
purposes of Section 202 of the Contract Act, if not for the purposes of Transfer of Property Act and
Registration Act. The findings of the Division Bench of this Court are as under:-
"10. For the purposes of the Law of Contract, therefore, it would not be useful to
restrict the meaning of the word "interest" by the narrow compass in which this
world is used at times in relation to immovable property. For instance, the last
sentence of section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act states that a contract for sale of
itself does not create any interest in or charge on immovable property. Similarly,
section 17(1)(b) of the Registration Act makes only those documents compulsorily
registerable which create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish any right, title or
interest, whether vested or contingent, of the value of one hundred rupees and
upwards to or in immovable property. Since an agreement for sale does not create
such a right, title or interest, it may not be compulsorily registerable. But in the
context of the Contract Act, it cannot be said that a person who is the beneficiary of
an agreement of sale has no right or interest in the subject-matter of the sale. He has
a legally enforceable right and interest in enforcing the contract of sale by the
execution of a sale deed and in getting possession of the property agreed to be sold
under the provisions of the Specific Relief Act. In the English Common Law, the
specific performance of contracts was a part of the law of contract. This is why
Chapter IV of the Contract Act deals with the performance of contracts which
includes the performance of contracts relating to immovable property also. In fact,
Section 4 of the Transfer of Property Act says that the chapters and sections of that
Act which relate to contracts shall be taken as part of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.
Therefore, the respondent in whose favour the appellant had executed an agreement
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 8Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
for the sale of an immovable property had an interest in the subject-matter of the
contract, namely, the shop, for the purposes of section 202 of the Contract Act if not
for the purposes of the Transfer of Property and the Registration Acts."
"13. All the conditions of irrevocability are satisfied in the present case. The authority
to the agent was given for valuable consideration which proceeded from the
respondent. It was given for the purpose of effectuating security or protecting or
securing the interest of the agent. For, the only purpose of the agency was to ensure
and secure the performance of the contract by the appellant in favour of the
respondent for whom Shri Gulati was acting as the husband and the nominee and,
therefore, a representative or agent. Where the performance of the agency is not to
secure the interest or the benefit of the agent then the agency is not irrevocable
merely because the agent has an interest in the exercise of it or has a special property
in or lieu for advances upon the subject-matter of it."
"15. The matter may be looked at from another point of view. Legally protected
interest or a benefit of one party casts a corresponding obligation on the other party
to the contract. If the contract of agency confers an interest or a benefit on the agent,
it casts an obligation on the principal. In the present case, the appellant, as a
principal was under an obligation to perform the contract of sale by the execution of a
conveyance. In the words of Bowstead, "authority is normally only irrevocable when
it is the security or other proprietary interest, or part of the security, or where its
conferring constitutes the performance of the obligation". Such a power is referred to
as a "power coupled with an interest" and should be regarded as a property
disposition rather than as the conferring of authority. The Restatement (the
American Restatement of the Law on Agency, Section 138) uses the phrase "power
given as security" defined as "a power to affect the legal relations of another, created
in the form of an agency authority, but held for the benefit of the power holder or a
third person, and given to secure the performance of a duty or to protect a title, either
legal or equitable, such power being given when the duty or title is created or given
for consideration." (Optic, page 424). Since the power of agency has been conferred
not for the benefit of the principal but for the benefit of the agent representing a third
party and not as representing the principal, the power becomes irrevocable."
(Emphasis supplied) It was also contended in the above case that the agreement to sell and the
General Power of Attorney were in the name of different persons and, therefore, the attorney cannot
be said to have any interest in the immovable property.
It was argued that the purchaser and the attorney were two different persons in the eyes of law and
the seller had not received any consideration from the attorney. This plea is also negatived by the
Division Bench and it was held that the attorney was the nominee/husband of the purchaser and his
interest was also that of the purchaser. The interest does not mean ownership or title but an
advantage, benefit or a legally enforceable right and, therefore, the Power of Attorney was
irrevocable. The findings of this Court in this regard are as under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 9Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
"16. The next question is whether this interest was only that of respondent or that of
Shri Gulati also. Paragraph 3 of the agreement of sale executed by the appellant itself
describes Shri Gulati as "a nominee and husband" of the respondent. It also says that
the appointment of Shri Gulati as the appellant's attorney was made "in order to
facilitate the transaction" of sale by the appellant to the respondent. Why had the
appellant to appoint as his agent Shri Gulati who was really the nominee and the
husband of the respondent? The reason obviously was that Shri Gulati was regarded
really interested in his wife, namely, the respondent rather than in the appellant
whose interests were opposed to those of the respondent. By his relationship with the
respondent and also by his nomination by the respondent Shri Gulati was in the
position of a representative or an agent of the respondent in fact.
17. It is only in law that he became an agent of the appellant. But this agency was only
with a view to serve the purpose of the respondent. This is why the last sentence in
paragraph 3 of the said agreement states that the appellant shall not be liable for any
negligence of Shri Gulati "who is the nominee"
of his own wife. Since Indian ladies are traditionally do not transact business activities, it is well
known that their husbands figure as their representatives or agents in these activities. This is why
Shri Gulati has acted for the respondent in these transactions. His interest in this transaction was
the same as that of his wife. It was, therefore, the interest of Shri Gulati that the property which was
the subject- matter of the agency should be conveyed by the appellant to the respondent. The
interest in such conveyance was not only of the respondent but also of Shri Gulati. The powers of
attorney in favour of Shri Gulati were executed by the appellant on the same date on which he
executed the agreement of sale in favour of the respondent. Since Shri Gulati acted for his wife, all
these documents, therefore, constitute one transaction. The powers of attorney are granted to Shri
Gulati only because an agreement of sale is entered in favour of his wife. Shri Gulati no less than his
wife is, therefore, interested in the subject-matter of the agency, namely, the shop. If the agency
were to be terminated, prejudice would have been caused to the interest not only of the respondent
but also of Shri Gulati.
Section 202 of the Contract Act, therefore, prohibited the appellant from terminating the agency of
Shri Gulati before the shop was duly conveyed by the appellant to the respondent.
18. There is no difference between the general and the special powers of attorney in this respect.
Both of them are for the benefit of the respodent and her nominee Shri Gulati. Neither of them is for
the benefit of the principal, the appellant. Shri Vohra argued that the respondent and her husband
Shri Gulati are two different persons in the eye of law. This may be so. But their interests are
identical. It cannot be said that Shri Gulati had no interest in the property which is the
subject-matter of the agency. We have already stated that interest does not mean ownership or title
in the immovable property. It means an advantage or a benefit or a legally enforceable right. Shri
Gulati had the right to legally enforce the obligation cast on the appellant to convey the property to
the respondent. This interest and right was of Shri Gulati himself though it may be for the benefit of
the respondent, namely, his wife. It is immaterial, therefore, that only the general power of attorney
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 10Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
was expressly made irrevocable while the special power of attorney was not so made. It is section
202 of the Contract Act which makes them both irrevocable."
(Emphasis supplied)
(ii) In Prem Raj v. Babu Ram, 1991 RLR 458, the seller agreed to sell an immovable property to the
purchaser and executed two Power of Attorneys in favour of the wife of the purchaser. The seller
later cancelled the Power of Attorneys and sued the purchaser alleging that DDA had refused the
permission to sell and, therefore, the agreement became frustrated. The seller claimed that he was
entitled to forfeit the money received and the possession be restored. Rejecting the plea, this Court
held that the Power of Attorneys executed for a consideration creating interest in the property
cannot be revoked or cancelled in view Section 202 of the Contract Act, 1872.
(iii) In H.L. Malhotra v. Nanak Jai Singhani, 1986 RLR (Note) 89, this Court held the Power of
Attorney for a consideration to be irrevocable. This Court further observed that prices of the
property have shot up and, therefore, the seller has become dishonest and wants to make more
money.
(iv) In Kuldeep Singh Suri v. Surinder Singh Kalra, (1999) 48 DRJ 463, the seller sold the leasehold
plot at Vasant Vihar, New Delhi to the purchaser by means of agreement to sell, General Power of
Attorney, construction agreement, affidavit, receipt and will. The General Power of Attorney was in
favour of the father of the purchaser. The seller filed a suit for possession which was dismissed by
this Court. This Court held the General Power of Attorney to be irrevocable and subsisting and the
deed of cancellation to be of no consequence. The findings of this Court are as under:-
"...the plaintiff was not legally competent to revoke the registered irrevocable power
of attorney in favour of Sardar Saran Singh as the defendants had paid the entire sale
consideration to the plaintiff and the plaintiff had in turn handed over possession of
the property to the defendants. The power of attorney was executed in favour of
Sardar Saran Singh, father of defendant No.2, only to facilitate the execution of the
sale deed in favour of the defendants. Since Sardar Saran Singh is the father of
defendant No.2, he is, therefore, interested in the subject-matter of agency, namely,
the plot number B-1/16, Vasant Vihar, New Delhi. Section 202 of the Contract Act
interdicts termination of agency where an agent has an interest in the subject-matter
of the agency. The power of attorney executed by the plaintiff in favour of Sardar
Saran Singh expressly stated that it could not be revoked by the plaintiff. In the
absence of an express contract permitting termination of the agency, section 202 of
he Contract Act barred such termination. A similar question came up for
consideration before a Division Bench of this Court in Harbans Singh Vs. Shanti
Devi, 1977 R.L.R. 487..."
"Therefore, I hold that the registered deed (Ext.P-3) cancelling the power of attorney
dated March 6, 1978 (Ext.D-7) is of no consequence and the power of attorney
Ext.D-7 in favour of Sardar Saran Singh still subsists."

(v) In D.R. Puri v. Kamlesh Sawhney, 2001 (60) DRJ 738, the vendor executed construction
agreement, General Power of Attorney, Special Power of Attorney, affidavit, will, receipt and
repudiation letter in favour of the purchaser in respect of a plot in Friends Colony, New Delhi
whereupon the purchaser constructed a building over the subject plot. The vendor later filed a suit
claiming possession of the subject property on the ground that he had only permitted the purchaser
to construct a building on his behalf. Rejecting the plea, this Court held that the true nature of the
transaction between the parties was an agreement to transfer the property. If the transaction is
contained in more than one document, they must be read and interpreted together as if they are one
document. This Court held the suit to be barred by Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882
and, therefore, the vendor was not entitled to recover the possession of the suit property. The Court
held as under:-
"16. In S. Chattanatha Karayalar v. The Central Bank of India Ltd. and Ors. AIR 1965
SC 1856 the Supreme Court stated in paragraph 3 of the Report as follows :
"The principle is well established that if the transaction is contained in more than one
document between the same parties they must be read and interpreted together and
they have the same legal effect for all purposes as if they are one document".
17. In the present case, it is not as if the parties had executed only one document. A series of
documents were executed which not only included agreements but also two Powers of Attorney,
affidavits of the entire family of the plaintiff as well as the plaintiff's Will. If the parties had entered
into a simple construction agreement, as alleged by the plaintiff, there was absolutely no reason for
the plaintiff to execute a Will and hand it over to the defendants. Similarly, there was absolutely no
reason for the family of the plaintiff to execute affidavits relinquishing their rights in the aforesaid
plot of land."
(Emphasis supplied) It was contended by the plaintiff in that case that the defendant neither filed
any suit for specific performance nor filed any Counter-claim. It was further contended that the suit
for specific performance had become time barred and, therefore, the plaintiff was entitled to the
decree for possession. Rejecting this plea, this Court held that the non-
filing of the suit for specific performance within limitation would mean that the purchaser lost the
opportunity of perfecting his title but that does not mean that the seller can claim possession. The
findings of this Court are as under:-
"40. It was finally contended by learned counsel for the plaintiff that one of the
ingredients of Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 is that the transferee
must be ready and willing to perform his part of the contract. It was his contention
that the defendants were not willing to perform their part of the contract and that a
suit for specific performance of the contract (assuming it to be an agreement to sell)
cannot now be instituted because it is barred by time. Reliance in this regard was
placed by learned counsel on Raju Roy and Ors. v. Kasinath Roy and Ors., AIR 1956
Pat 308.

41. It is no doubt true that the appropriate course of action for the defendant would
have been to either raise a counter claim against the plaintiff or to file a suit against
the plaintiff for specific performance of the agreement to sell. This has not been done
by the defendants.
42. However, I am of the view that this by itself is not enough to decree the suit in
favor of the plaintiff. The reason for this is that the right of the defendants is not
extinguished. It is only that the remedy cannot be resorted to by the defendants
because it is barred by time. There is nothing to indicate that the defendants are not
willing to perform their part of the contract. On the contrary, as far as they are
concerned, the contract stood concluded when they paid an amount of Rs.1,40,000/-
to the plaintiff and received possession of the aforesaid plot of land as well as all the
original documents pertaining to the aforesaid plot of land. The only other thing
which was required to be done was to actually have the and to have the title
registered in accordance with law so as to perfect it in favor of defendant No. 1.
43. A down-to-earth view of the whole case has also to be taken. Looked at from this
point of view, it must be accepted that the defendants took possession of the
aforesaid plot of land in 1979 ; that they spent a considerable amount in constructing
a house on the aforesaid plot of land ; and that they have been living in the suit
property since 1982. Is it possible to realistically say that they now have no interest in
the aforesaid plot of land?
44. The mere fact that the defendants did not file a counter claim or a suit for specific
performance, cannot lead to any conclusion that they have given up all their rights in
the aforesaid plot of land. It can, at best, be said that the Defendants have lost the
opportunity of perfecting their title. Under the circumstances, I am of the view the
decision cited by learned counsel for the plaintiff does not really help him."

(vi) In Ramesh Mohan v. Raj Krishan, PLR (1984) 86 P&H 211, an irrevocable General Power of
Attorney in respect of an immovable property was executed along with the agreement to sell, receipt
of entire sale consideration and delivery of possession. The power of attorney was later cancelled
which came for consideration before Punjab and Haryana High Court.
It was contended before the Court that an agreement to sell does not create any interest in or charge
on immovable property and, therefore, Section 202 of the Contract Act would not be attracted.
Repelling this argument, the Court held that the agreement „of itself(cid:128) may not create any interest in
the property but the words "an interest in property which forms the subject matter of the tenancy"
in Section 202 of the Contract Act are of wider amplitude than the words "an interest in or charge on
such property" in Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act and where the vendor has received the
sale consideration in pursuance of the agreement to sell and has delivered the possession to the
purchaser, the purchaser would have interest in the property within the meaning of Section 202 of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 13Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
the Contract Act. The Court held that interest was created in the suit property when its possession
was delivered and the total sale consideration was received in pursuance of the agreement under
Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. The Court further held that the agreement was not
a mere agreement to sell, but more than that because the transaction was complete in all respects
except the execution of the regular sale deed and the registration thereof. Thus, interest was created
in the property and Section 202 of the Contract Act was applicable. The Court further held that the
Power of Attorney was irrevocable in view of the provisions of Section 202 of the Contract Act and
the nominee continued to be the agent of the seller in spite of the cancellation of the Power of
Attorney. The findings of the Court are reproduced as under:-
"4. The main contention raised on behalf of the appellants is that the power of
attorney, Exhibit P.W.5/3, was irrevocable on account of the following reasons:
(i) because of the agreement to this effect itself between the parties when it was
agreed that it was irrevocable; and
(ii) in view of the provisions of Section 202 of the Indian Contract Act, which reads:-
"Where the agent has himself an interest in the property which forms the
subject-matter of the agency, the agency cannot, in the absence of an express
contract, be terminated to the prejudice of such interest."
Thus argued the Learned Counsel that the provisions, of Section 202 of the Contract Act are
applicable to the transfer of the immovable property under the Transfer of Property Act (hereafter
called the Act) in view of the provisions of Section 4 of the Act, which read:-
"The chapters and sections of this Act which relate to contracts snail be taken as part
of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 and Sections 54, paragraphs 2 and 3, 59, 107 and 123
shall be read as supplemental to the Indian Registration Act, 1908."
According to the learned counsel for the plaintiffs- respondents, no interest was created in the
property agreed to be sold by merely executing the agreement, Exhibit D.W.1/1, in favour of Ram
Narain, defendant, because Section 54 of the Act, inter alia provides that a contract for the sale of
immovable property is a contract; that a sale of such property shall take place on terms settled
between the parties and that it does not, of itself, create any interest in, or charge on, such property,
and, therefore, the provisions of Section 202 of the Contract Act, (as reproduced above), were not
attracted in the present case. On the other hand, the argument raised on behalf of the appellants is
that the agreement „of itself(cid:128) may not create any interest in the property, but in the present case, on
the facts admitted, interest was created in the suit property when its possession was delivered and
the total sale price was received in pursuance of the agreement. I find force in this contention. In a
somewhat similar situation, it was observed in Rabindra Nath v. Harendra Kumar, A.I.R. 1956 Cal.
462, that the answer to such question depends on the nature of the agreement for sale in each case.
The language of Section 54 emphasises that „of itself(cid:128) a contract for sale does not create any interest
or charge on the property. But very often a contract for sale does not stand by itself where there is a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 14Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
part payment of the purchase price or payment of what is called the earnest money. In that event
Section 55(6)(b) of the Act, would be attracted and it will be treated as though the ownership of the
property had passed and there is a charge for part of the purchase money paid. In the present case,
the agreement, Exhibit D.W.1/1, was not a mere agreement to sell, but more than that because
practically, the transaction, was complete in all respects except the execution of the regular sale deed
and the registration thereof. Thus, interest was created in the property under the agreement and the
provisions of Section 202 of the Contract Act are applicable to the facts of the present case.
Moreover, the words, "an interest in the property which forms the subject-matter of the agency"
occurring in Section 202 of the Contract Act, are of wide amplitude than the words, "interest in or
charge on, such property," in Section 54 of the Act. It is true that the mere execution of the
agreement for sale without doing anything more will not create any interest in the property to be
sold, but where the vendor has received the sale price and in pursuance of the agreement to sell
possession thereof has been delivered to the prospective vendee, then it could not be successfully
argued on the basis of Section 54 of the Act that no interest was created in the property. The words,
„of itself(cid:128) in Section 54 of the Act, are very material to reach the right conclusion in a given case.
Thus, on the facts of the present case, the irresistible conclusion is that in view of the provisions of
Section 202 of the Contract Act, as well as because of the agreement itself the power of attorney,
Exhibit, P.W.5/3, was irrevocable. Ram Narain, defendant-appellant continued to be the agent of
the plaintiffs-respondents in spite of any cancellation of the power of attorney, Exhibit P.W.5/3.
Thus, the decree suffered by Ram Narain, on behalf of the plaintiffs in the suit filed on behalf of
Ramesh Mohan, defendant-appellant, was binding on them. In any case, it could not be held to be
invalid or to have been obtained by fraud or misrepresentation as alleged in the plaint. In view of the
said finding, the second limb of the question formulated above, does not arise. However,
independent of the power of attorney, and the said decree the defendants are entitled to protect
their possession of the suit land which they got in performance of the agreement on payment of the
entire sale price. There was nothing more to be done in furtherance of the agreement, Exhibit P.W.
5/3, on the part of the vendee as he had paid the whole sale price and had taken possession of the
suit land. It was for the Plaintiffs to execute the regular sale deed in favour of Ram Narain,
defendant-appellant, or in favour of any other person he may so choose. This, the plaintiffs failed to
do in spite of the telegram, Exhibit DW 3. Not only that, in the present case, the plaintiffs nowhere
pleaded that they were ready and willing to perform their part of the agreement; rather they denied
the execution of the agreement in the first instance and also the receipt of the sale price of
Rs.41,000/-. It was only during the trial that on account of the overwhelming evidence led on behalf
of the defendants, the plaintiffs had to admit the execution of the agreement to sell as well as the
receipt of the sale price by them. From the evidence, of the defendants, the suit by Romesh Mohan,
defendant-appellant, was filed at the instance of the plaintiffs in order to get the necessary transfer
made by way of the consent decree. However, it may or may not be so, but it is immaterial for the
purposes of the present controversy. Ram Narain, defendant-appellant, in order to safeguard his
interest and to debar the plaintiffs from doing any mischief, in future, after receiving the sale price,
also got the irrevocable power of attorney in his favour. As observed earlier, the plaintiffs never
pleaded any such agreement or admitted the receipt of any sale price, but filed the simple suit for
the cancellation of the decree on the basis of fraud and collusion etc. As held earlier, the question of
any fraud etc. did not arise because the plaintiffs had already washed off their hands from the land,
in dispute, by receiving the entire sale price and handing over its possession besides executing the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 15Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
irrevocable power of attorney in favour of Ram Narain, defendant-appellant. The equitable
considerations as embodied in Section 53A of the Act, are fully applicable to the facts of the present
case. In a similar situation, it was held in Venkatesh v.
Mallappa, A.I.R. 1922 Bom. 9 (2), that the plaintiff who sells an immovable property to defendant,
cannot claim possession from defendant-vendee who has paid the purchase money and has been all
along in possession, though no sale-deed has been executed. The equitable principles which should
be applied to such facts are perfectly clear. ..."
(vii) In Suraj Lamp and Industries Private Limited v.
State of Haryana, 183 (2011) DLT 1 (SC), the Supreme Court held that General Power of Attorney
transactions do not convey any title or interest in an immovable property except to the extent of
limited rights granted under Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and Section 202 of
the Contract Act, 1872. The Supreme Court held that General Power of Attorney transactions cannot
be treated as complete transfer but they can be treated as existing agreement of sale and the
attorney holder can execute the deed of conveyance in exercise of the power granted. The Supreme
Court further held that the General Power of Attorney transactions executed before the date of the
judgment can be relied upon to apply for regularization of allotments/leases. The observations of
the Supreme Court are as under:-
"12. Any contract of sale (agreement to sell) which is not a registered deed of
conveyance (deed of sale) would fall short of the requirements of Sections 54 and 55
of Transfer of Property Act and will not confer any title nor transfer any interest in an
immovable property (except to the limited right granted under Section 53A of
Transfer of Property Act). According to Transfer of Property Act, an agreement of
sale, whether with possession or without possession, is not a conveyance.
Section 54 of Transfer of Property Act enacts that sale of immoveable property can be made only by
a registered instrument and an agreement of sale does not create any interest or charge on its
subject matter.
Scope of Power of Attorney
13. A power of attorney is not an instrument of transfer in regard to any right, title or interest in an
immovable property. The power of attorney is creation of an agency whereby the grantor authorizes
the grantee to do the acts specified therein, on behalf of grantor, which when executed will be
binding on the grantor as if done by him (see Section 1A and Section 2 of the Powers of Attorney Act,
1882). It is revocable or terminable at any time unless it is made irrevocable in a manner known to
law. Even an irrevocable attorney does not have the effect of transferring title to the grantee. In State
of Rajasthan v. Basant Nehata, VI (2005) SLT 609 = III (2005) CLT 283 (SC) = 2005 (12) SCC 77,
this Court held:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 16Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
"A grant of power of attorney is essentially governed by Chapter X of the Contract
Act. By reason of a deed of power of attorney, an agent is formally appointed to act
for the principal in one transaction or a series of transactions or to manage the affairs
of the principal generally conferring necessary authority upon another person. A deed
of power of attorney is executed by the principal in favour of the agent. The agent
derives a right to use his name and all acts, deeds and things done by him and subject
to the limitations contained in the said deed, the same shall be read as if done by the
donor. A power of attorney is, as is well known, a document of convenience.
Execution of a power of attorney in terms of the provisions of the Contract Act as also
the Powers of Attorney Act is valid. A power of attorney, we have noticed
hereinbefore, is executed by the donor so as to enable the donee to act on his behalf.
Except in cases where power of attorney is coupled with interest, it is revocable. The
donee in exercise of his power under such power of attorney only acts in place of the
donor subject of course to the powers granted to him by reason thereof. He cannot
use the power of attorney for his own benefit. He acts in a fiduciary capacity. Any act
of infidelity or breach of trust is a matter between the donor and the donee."
An attorney holder may however execute a deed of conveyance in exercise of the power granted
under the power of attorney and convey title on behalf of the grantor."
"15. Therefore, a SA/GPA/WILL transaction does not convey any title nor create any
interest in an immovable property. The observations by the Delhi High Court, in Asha
M. Jain v. Canara Bank, 94 (2001) DLT 841 that the "concept of power of attorney
sales have been recognized as a mode of transaction" when dealing with transactions
by way of SA/GPA/WILL are unwarranted and not justified, unintendedly misleading
the general public into thinking that SA/GPA/WILL transactions are some kind of a
recognized or accepted mode of transfer and that it can be a valid substitute for a sale
deed.
Such decisions to the extent they recognize or accept SA/GPA/WILL transactions as concluded
transfers, as contrasted from an agreement to transfer, are not good law.
16. We therefore reiterate that immovable property can be legally and lawfully transferred/conveyed
only by a registered deed of conveyance. Transactions of the nature of 'GPA sales' or 'SA/GPA/WILL
transfers' do not convey title and do not amount to transfer, nor can they be recognized or valid
mode of transfer of immoveable property. The courts will not treat such transactions as completed
or concluded transfers or as conveyances as they neither convey title nor create any interest in an
immovable property. They cannot be recognized as deeds of title, except to the limited extent of
Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act. Such transactions cannot be relied upon or made the
basis for mutations in Municipal or Revenue Records. What is stated above will apply not only to
deeds of conveyance in regard to freehold property but also to transfer of leasehold property. A lease
can be validly transferred only under a registered Assignment of Lease. It is time that an end is put
to the pernicious practice of SA/GPA/WILL transactions known as GPA sales."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 17Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
"18. We have merely drawn attention to and reiterated the well-settled legal position
that SA/GPA/WILL transactions are not 'transfers' or 'sales' and that such
transactions cannot be treated as completed transfers or conveyances. They can
continue to be treated as existing agreement of sale. Nothing prevents affected parties
from getting registered Deeds of Conveyance to complete their title. The said
'SA/GPA/WILL transactions' may also be used to obtain specific performance or to
defend possession under Section 53A of Transfer of Property Act. If they are entered
before this day, they may be relied upon to apply for regularization of
allotments/leases by Development Authorities. We make it clear that if the
documents relating to 'SA/GPA/WILL transactions' has been accepted acted upon by
DDA or other developmental authorities or by the Municipal or revenue authorities
to effect mutation, they need not be disturbed, merely on account of this decision.
19. We make it clear that our observations are not intended to in any way affect the
validity of sale agreements and powers of attorney executed in genuine transactions.
For example, a person may give a power of attorney to his spouse, son, daughter,
brother, sister or a relative to manage his affairs or to execute a deed of conveyance.
A person may enter into a development agreement with a land developer or builder
for developing the land either by forming plots or by constructing apartment
buildings and in that behalf execute an agreement of sale and grant a Power of
Attorney empowering the developer to execute agreements of sale or conveyances in
regard to individual plots of land or undivided shares in the land relating to
apartments in favour of prospective purchasers. In several States, the execution of
such development agreements and powers of attorney are already regulated by law
and subjected to specific stamp duty. Our observations regarding 'SA/GPA/WILL
transactions' are not intended to apply to such bona fide/genuine transactions."
(viii) In Ramesh Chand v. Suresh Chand, 188 (2012) DLT 538, this Court held that the Power of
Attorney given for a consideration coupled with interest is irrevocable under Section 202 of the
Contract Act, 1872 and subsists even after the death of the executant. This Court further held that
the purchaser may not be a classical owner as would be an owner under the registered sale-deed but
surely he would have better rights/entitlement of possession than the person who is in actual
physical possession. This Court held that the Supreme Court in Suraj Lamp and Industries Private
Limited v.
State of Haryana (supra) has reiterated the rights in an immovable property under Section 53A of
the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 as well as Section 202 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. The
observations of this Court are reproduced hereunder:-
"3. ...The Supreme Court has however reiterated that rights which are created
pursuant to Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 dealing with the
doctrine of part performance (para 12), an irrevocable right of a person holding a
power of attorney given for consideration coupled with interest as per Section 202 of
the Contract Act, 1872 (para 13) and devolution of interest pursuant to a Will (para
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 18Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
14). Therefore, no doubt, a person strictly may not have complete ownership rights
unless there is a duly registered sale deed, however, certain rights can exist in an
immovable property pursuant to the provisions of Section 53A of the Transfer of
Property Act, 1882, Section 202 of the Contract Act, 1872. There also takes place
devolution of interest after the death of the testator in terms of a Will."
"4. ...The object of giving validity to a power of attorney given for consideration even
after death of the executants is to ensure that entitlement under such power of
attorney remains because the same is not a regular or a routine power of attorney but
the same had elements of a commercial transaction which cannot be allowed to be
frustrated on account of death of the executant of the power of attorney."
"12. In view of the aforesaid facts and the validity of the documents, being the power
of attorney and the Will dated 16.5.1996, the respondent No.1/plaintiff would though
not be the classical owner of the suit property as would an owner be under a duly
registered sale deed, but surely he would have better rights/entitlement of possession
of the suit property than the appellant/defendant No.1. In fact, I would go to the
extent saying that by virtue of para 14 of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the
case of Suraj Lamps & Industries Pvt. Ltd. (supra) taken with the fact that Sh.
Kundan Lal has already died, the respondent No.1/plaintiff becomes an owner of the
property by virtue of the registered Will dated 16.5.1996. A right to possession of an
immovable property arises not only from a complete ownership right in the property
but having a better title or a better entitlement/right to the possession of the property
than qua the person who is in actual physical possession thereof. The facts of the
present case show that the respondent No.1/plaintiff has undoubtedly better
entitlement/title/rights in the suit property so as to claim possession from the
appellant/defendant No.1/brother."
19. The Supreme Court and this Court have time and again held that heavy cost should be imposed
in frivolous cases and in appropriate cases, prosecution be ordered to maintain purity and sanctity
of judicial proceedings. It is necessary to examine the relevant judgments in this regard.
20. False claims and defences
(i) In Maria Margarida Sequeria Fernandes v. Erasmo Jack de Sequeria, 2012 (3) SCALE 550, the
Supreme Court held that false claims and defences are serious problems with real estate litigation,
predominantly because of ever escalating prices of the real estate. The Supreme Court held as
under:-
"False claims and false defences
84. False claims and defences are really serious problems with real estate litigation,
predominantly because of ever escalating prices of the real estate. Litigation
pertaining to valuable real estate properties is dragged on by unscrupulous litigants
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 19Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
in the hope that the other party will tire out and ultimately would settle with them by
paying a huge amount. This happens because of the enormous delay in adjudication
of cases in our Courts. If pragmatic approach is adopted, then this problem can be
minimized to a large extent."
(ii) In Dalip Singh v. State of U.P., (2010) 2 SCC 114, the Supreme Court observed that a new creed
of litigants have cropped up in the last 40 years who do not have any respect for truth and
shamelessly resort to falsehood and unethical means for achieving their goals. The observations of
the Supreme Court are as under:-
"1. For many centuries, Indian society cherished two basic values of life i.e., 'Satya'
(truth) and 'Ahimsa' (non-violence). Mahavir, Gautam Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi
guided the people to ingrain these values in their daily life. Truth constituted an
integral part of the justice-delivery system which was in vogue in the
pre-Independence era and the people used to feel proud to tell truth in the courts
irrespective of the consequences. However, post- Independence period has seen
drastic changes in our value system. The materialism has over shadowed the old
ethos and the quest for personal gain has become so intense that those involved in
litigation do not hesitate to take shelter of falsehood, misrepresentation and
suppression of facts in the court proceedings.
2. In last 40 years, a new creed of litigants has cropped up. Those who belong to this
creed do not have any respect for truth. They shamelessly resort to falsehood and
unethical means for achieving their goals. In order to meet the challenge posed by
this new creed of litigants, the courts have, from time to time, evolved new rules and
it is now well established that a litigant, who attempts to pollute the stream of justice
or who touches the pure fountain of justice with tainted hands, is not entitled to any
relief, interim or final."
(Emphasis supplied)
(iii) In Satyender Singh v. Gulab Singh, MANU/DE/1047/2012, the Division Bench of this Court
following Dalip Singh v. State of U.P. (supra) observed that the Courts are flooded with litigation
with false and incoherent pleas and tainted evidence led by the parties due to which the judicial
system in the country is choked and such litigants are consuming Court(cid:128)s time for a wrong cause.
The observations of this Court are as under:-
"2. As rightly observed by the Supreme Court, Satya is a basic value of life which was
required to be followed by everybody and is recognized since many centuries. In spite
of caution, courts are continued to be flooded with litigation with false and
incoherent pleas and tainted evidence led by the parties. The judicial system in the
country is choked and such litigants are consuming courts„ time for a wrong cause.
Efforts are made by the parties to steal a march over their rivals by resorting to false
and incoherent statements made before the Court. Indeed, it is a nightmare faced by
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 20Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
a Trier of Facts; required to stitch a garment, when confronted with a fabric where
the weft, shuttling back and forth across the warp in weaving, is nothing but lies. As
the threads of the weft fall, the yarn of the warp also collapses; and there is no fabric
left."
(Emphasis supplied)
21. Imposition of costs
(i) In Ramrameshwari Devi v. Nirmala Devi, (2011) 8 SCC 249, the Supreme Court has held that the
Courts have to take into consideration pragmatic realities and have to be realistic in imposing the
costs. The relevant paragraphs of the said judgment are reproduced hereunder:-
"45. ...We are clearly of the view that unless we ensure that wrongdoers are denied
profit or undue benefit from the frivolous litigation, it would be difficult to control
frivolous and uncalled for litigations. In order to curb uncalled for and frivolous
litigation, the courts have to ensure that there is no incentive or motive for uncalled
for litigation. It is a matter of common experience that court's otherwise scarce and
valuable time is consumed or more appropriately wasted in a large number of
uncalled for cases."
"52. The main question which arises for our consideration is whether the prevailing
delay in civil litigation can be curbed? In our considered opinion the existing system
can be drastically changed or improved if the following steps are taken by the trial
courts while dealing with the civil trials.
xxx C. Imposition of actual, realistic or proper costs and or ordering prosecution
would go a long way in controlling the tendency of introducing false pleadings and
forged and fabricated documents by the litigants. Imposition of heavy costs would
also control unnecessary adjournments by the parties. In appropriate cases the courts
may consider ordering prosecution otherwise it may not be possible to maintain
purity and sanctity of judicial proceedings..."
"54. While imposing costs we have to take into consideration pragmatic realities and
be realistic what the Defendants or the Respondents had to actually incur in
contesting the litigation before different courts. We have to also broadly take into
consideration the prevalent fee structure of the lawyers and other miscellaneous
expenses which have to be incurred towards drafting and filing of the counter
affidavit, miscellaneous charges towards typing, photocopying, court fee etc.
55. The other factor which should not be forgotten while imposing costs is for how
long the Defendants or Respondents were compelled to contest and defend the
litigation in various courts. The Appellants in the instant case have harassed the
Respondents to the hilt for four decades in a totally frivolous and dishonest litigation
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 21Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
in various courts. The Appellants have also wasted judicial time of the various courts
for the last 40 years.
56. On consideration of totality of the facts and circumstances of this case, we do not
find any infirmity in the well reasoned impugned order/judgment. These appeals are
consequently dismissed with costs, which we quantify as Rs. 2,00,000/- (Rupees Two
Lakhs only). We are imposing the costs not out of anguish but by following the
fundamental principle that wrongdoers should not get benefit out of frivolous
litigation."
(Emphasis supplied)
(ii) In Maria Margarida Sequeria Fernandes v. Erasmo Jack de Sequeria (supra) the Supreme Court
held that heavy costs and prosecution should be ordered in cases of false claims and defences. The
Supreme Court held as under:-
"85. This Court in a recent judgment in Ramrameshwari Devi and Ors. (supra) aptly
observed at page 266 that unless wrongdoers are denied profit from frivolous
litigation, it would be difficult to prevent it. In order to curb uncalled for and
frivolous litigation, the Courts have to ensure that there is no incentive or motive for
uncalled for litigation. It is a matter of common experience that Court's otherwise
scarce time is consumed or more appropriately, wasted in a large number of uncalled
for cases. In this very judgment, the Court provided that this problem can be solved
or at least be minimized if exemplary cost is imposed for instituting frivolous
litigation. The Court observed at pages 267-268 that imposition of actual, realistic or
proper costs and/or ordering prosecution in appropriate cases would go a long way in
controlling the tendency of introducing false pleadings and forged and fabricated
documents by the litigants. Imposition of heavy costs would also control unnecessary
adjournments by the parties. In appropriate cases, the Courts may consider ordering
prosecution otherwise it may not be possible to maintain purity and sanctity of
judicial proceedings."
(iii) In Padmawati and Ors. v. Harijan Sewak Sangh, 154 (2008) DLT 411, this Court imposed cost of
Rs.15.1 lakhs and noted as under:
"6. The case at hand shows that frivolous defences and frivolous litigation is a
calculated venture involving no risks situation. You have only to engage professionals
to prolong the litigation so as to deprive the rights of a person and enjoy the fruits of
illegalities. I consider that in such cases where Court finds that using the Courts as a
tool, a litigant has perpetuated illegalities or has perpetuated an illegal possession,
the Court must impose costs on such litigants which should be equal to the benefits
derived by the litigant and harm and deprivation suffered by the rightful person so as
to check the frivolous litigation and prevent the people from reaping a rich harvest of
illegal acts through the Courts. One of the aim of every judicial system has to be to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 22Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
discourage unjust enrichment using Courts as a tool. The costs imposed by the Courts
must in all cases should be the real costs equal to deprivation suffered by the rightful
person."
"9. Before parting with this case, I consider it necessary to pen down that one of the
reasons for over-flowing of court dockets is the frivolous litigation in which the
Courts are engaged by the litigants and which is dragged as long as possible. Even if
these litigants ultimately lose the lis, they become the real victors and have the last
laugh. This class of people who perpetuate illegal acts by obtaining stays and
injunctions from the Courts must be made to pay the sufferer not only the entire
illegal gains made by them as costs to the person deprived of his right and also must
be burdened with exemplary costs. Faith of people in judiciary can only be sustained
if the persons on the right side of the law do not feel that even if they keep fighting for
justice in the Court and ultimately win, they would turn out to be a fool since winning
a case after 20 or 30 years would make wrong doer as real gainer, who had reaped the
benefits for all those years. Thus, it becomes the duty of the Courts to see that such
wrong doers are discouraged at every step and even if they succeed in prolonging the
litigation due to their money power, ultimately they must suffer the costs of all these
years long litigation. Despite settled legal positions, the obvious wrong doers, use one
after another tier of judicial review mechanism as a gamble, knowing fully well that
dice is always loaded in their favour, since even if they lose, the time gained is the real
gain. This situation must be redeemed by the Courts."
(Emphasis supplied)
22. Truth should be the guiding star in the entire legal process
(i) In Maria Margarida Sequeria Fernandes v. Erasmo Jack de Sequeria (Dead) through LRs.
(supra), the Supreme Court held that truth should be a guiding star in entire legal process. The
observations of the Supreme Court are reproduced hereunder:-
"Truth as guiding star in judicial process
31. In this unfortunate litigation, the Court's serious endeavour has to be to find out
where in fact the truth lies. The truth should be the guiding star in the entire judicial
process.
32. Truth alone has to be the foundation of justice. The entire judicial system has
been created only to discern and find out the real truth. Judges at all levels have to
seriously engage themselves in the journey of discovering the truth. That is their
mandate, obligation and bounden duty.
33. Justice system will acquire credibility only when people will be convinced that
justice is based on the foundation of the truth.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 23Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
34. In Mohanlal Shamji Soni v. Union of India, 1991 Supp (1) SCC 271, this Court
observed that in such a situation a question that arises for consideration is whether
the presiding officer of a Court should simply sit as a mere umpire at a contest
between two parties and declare at the end of the combat who has won and who has
lost or is there not any legal duty of his own, independent of the parties, to take an
active role in the proceedings in finding the truth and administering justice? It is a
well accepted and settled principle that a Court must discharge its statutory
functions-whether discretionary or obligatory-according to law in dispensing justice
because it is the duty of a Court not only to do justice but also to ensure that justice is
being done.
35. What people expect is that the Court should discharge its obligation to find out
where in fact the truth lies. Right from inception of the judicial system it has been
accepted that discovery, vindication and establishment of truth are the main
purposes underlying the existence of the courts of justice.
36. In Ritesh Tewari v. State of U.P., (2010) 10 SCC 677 this Court reproduced often
quoted quotation which reads as under:
"Every trial is voyage of discovery in which truth is the quest"
37. This Court observed that the power is to be exercised with an object to subserve the cause of
justice and public interest and for getting the evidence in aid of a just decision and to uphold the
truth.
38. Lord Denning, in the case of Jones v. National Coal Board, (1957) 2 QB 55 has observed that:
"In the system of trial that we evolved in this country, the Judge sits to hear and
determine the issues raised by the parties, not to conduct an investigation or
examination on behalf of the society at large, as happens, we believe, in some foreign
countries."
39. Certainly, the above, is not true of the Indian Judicial system. A judge in the Indian System has
to be regarded as failing to exercise its jurisdiction and thereby discharging its judicial duty, if in the
guise of remaining neutral, he opts to remain passive to the proceedings before him. He has to
always keep in mind that "every trial is a voyage of discovery in which truth is the quest". In order to
bring on record the relevant fact, he has to play an active role; no doubt within the bounds of the
statutorily defined procedural law.
40. Lord Denning further observed in the said case of Jones (supra) that "'It's all very well to paint
justice blind, but she does better without a bandage round her eyes. She should be blind indeed to
favour or prejudice, but clear to see which way lies the truth...."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 24Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
41. World over, modern procedural Codes are increasingly relying on full disclosure by the parties.
Managerial powers of the Judge are being deployed to ensure that the scope of the factual
controversy is minimized.
42. In civil cases, adherence to Section 30 Code of Civil Procedure would also help in ascertaining
the truth. It seems that this provision which ought to be frequently used is rarely pressed in service
by our judicial officers and judges. Section 30 Code of Civil Procedure reads as under:
30. Power to order discovery and the like. - Subject to such conditions and limitations
as may be prescribed, the Court may, at any time either of its own motion or on the
application of any party, -
(a) make such orders as may be necessary or reasonable in all matters relating to the
delivery and answering of interrogatories, the admission of documents and facts, and
the discovery, inspection, production, impounding and return of documents or other
material objects producible as evidence;
(b) issue summons to persons whose attendance is required either to give evidence or
to produce documents or such other objects as aforesaid;
(c) order any fact to be proved by affidavit
43. "Satyameva Jayate" (Literally: "Truth Stands Invincible") is a mantra from the ancient scripture
Mundaka Upanishad. Upon independence of India, it was adopted as the national motto of India. It
is inscribed in Devanagari script at the base of the national emblem. The meaning of full mantra is
as follows:
"Truth alone triumphs; not falsehood. Through truth the divine path is spread out by
which the sages whose desires have been completely fulfilled, reach where that
supreme treasure of Truth resides.
44. Malimath Committee on Judicial Reforms heavily relied on the fact that in discovering truth, the
judges of all Courts need to play an active role. The Committee observed thus:
2.2... "In the adversarial system truth is supposed to emerge from the respective
versions of the facts presented by the prosecution and the defence before a neutral
judge. The judge acts like an umpire to see whether the prosecution has been able to
prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. The State discharges the obligation to
protect life, liberty and property of the citizens by taking suitable preventive and
punitive measures which also serve the object of preventing private retribution so
essential for maintenance of peace and law and order in the society doubt and gives
the benefit of doubt to the accused. It is the parties that determine the scope of
dispute and decide largely, autonomously and in a selective manner on the evidence
that they decide to present to the court. The trial is oral, continuous and
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 25Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
confrontational. The parties use cross-examination of witnesses to undermine the
opposing case and to discover information the other side has not brought out. The
judge in his anxiety to maintain his position of neutrality never takes any initiative to
discover truth. He does not correct the aberrations in the investigation or in the
matter of production of evidence before court...."
2.15 "The Adversarial System lacks dynamism because it has no lofty ideal to inspire.
It has not been entrusted with a positive duty to discover truth as in the Inquisitorial
System. When the investigation is perfunctory or ineffective, Judges seldom take any
initiative to remedy the situation.
During the trial, the Judges do not bother if relevant evidence is not produced and plays a passive
role as he has no duty to search for truth...."
2.16.9. "Truth being the cherished ideal and ethos of India, pursuit of truth should be the guiding
star of the Criminal Justice System. For justice to be done truth must prevail. It is truth that must
protect the innocent and it is truth that must be the basis to punish the guilty. Truth is the very soul
of justice. Therefore truth should become the ideal to inspire the courts to pursue. This can be
achieved by statutorily mandating the courts to become active seekers of truth. It is of seminal
importance to inject vitality into our system if we have to regain the lost confidence of the people.
Concern for and duty to seek truth should not become the limited concern of the courts. It should
become the paramount duty of everyone to assist the court in its quest for truth."
45. In Chandra Shashi v. Anil Kumar Verma, (1995) 1 SCC 421, to enable the Courts to ward off
unjustified interference in their working, those who indulge in immoral acts like perjury,
pre-variation and motivated falsehoods have to be appropriately dealt with, without which it would
not be possible for any Court to administer justice in the true sense and to the satisfaction of those
who approach it in the hope that truth would ultimately prevail. People would have faith in Courts
when they would find that truth alone triumphs in Courts.
46. Truth has been foundation of other judicial systems, such as, the United States of America, the
United Kingdom and other countries.
47. In James v. Giles et al. v. State of Maryland, (386 U.S. 66, 87, S. Ct. 793), the US Supreme Court,
in ruling on the conduct of prosecution in suppressing evidence favourable to the Defendants and
use of perjured testimony held that such rules existed for a purpose as a necessary component of the
search for truth and justice that judges, like prosecutors must undertake. It further held that the
State's obligation under the Due Process Clause "is not to convict, but to see that so far as possible,
truth emerges."
48. The obligation to pursue truth has been carried to extremes. Thus, in United States v. J. Lee
Havens, 446 U.S. 620, 100 St.Ct. 1912, it was held that the government may use illegally obtained
evidence to impeach a defendant's fraudulent statements during cross-examination for the purpose
of seeking justice, for the purpose of "arriving at the truth, which is a fundamental goal of our legal
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 26Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
system".
49. Justice Cardozo in his widely read and appreciated book "The Nature of the Judicial Process"
discusses the role of the judges. The relevant part is reproduced as under:
"There has been a certain lack of candour,"
"in much of the discussion of the theme [of judges' humanity], or rather perhaps in
the refusal to discuss it, as if judges must lose respect and confidence by the reminder
that they are subject to human limitations."
"I do not doubt the grandeur of conception which lifts them into the realm of pure
reason, above and beyond the sweep of perturbing and deflecting forces. None the
less, if there is anything of reality in my analysis of the judicial process, they do not
stand aloof on these chill and distant heights; and we shall not help the cause of truth
by acting and speaking as if they do."
50. Aharon Barak, President of Israeli Supreme Court from 1995 to 2006 takes the position that:
"For issues in which stability is actually more important than the substance of the
solution - and there are many such case - I will join the majority, without restating
my dissent each time. Only when my dissenting opinion reflects an issue that is
central for me - that goes to the core of my role as a judge - will I not capitulate, and
will I continue to restate my dissenting opinion:
"Truth or stability - truth is preferable".
"On the contrary, public confidence means ruling according to the law and according
to the judge's conscience, whatever the attitude of the public may be. Public
confidence means giving expression to history, not to hysteria. Public confidence is
ensured by the recognition that the judge is doing justice within the framework of the
law and its provisions. Judges must act - inside and outside the court - in a manner
that preserves public confidence in them. They must understand that judging is not
merely a job but a way of life. It is a way of life that does not include the pursuit of
material wealth or publicity; it is a way of life based on spiritual wealth; it is a way of
life that includes an objective and impartial search for truth."
51. In the administration of justice, judges and lawyers play equal roles. Like judges, lawyers also
must ensure that truth triumphs in the administration of justice.
52. Truth is the foundation of justice. It must be the endeavour of all the judicial officers and judges
to ascertain truth in every matter and no stone should be left unturned in achieving this object.
Courts must give greater emphasis on the veracity of pleadings and documents in order to ascertain
the truth."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 27Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
"72. The Court will examine the pleadings for specificity as also the supporting
material for sufficiency and then pass appropriate orders.
73. Discovery and production of documents and answers to interrogatories, together
with an approach of considering what in ordinary course of human affairs is more
likely to have been the probability, will prevent many a false claims or defences from
sailing beyond the stage for issues.
74. If the pleadings do not give sufficient details, they will not raise an issue, and the
Court can reject the claim or pass a decree on admission.
75. On vague pleadings, no issue arises. Only when he so establishes, does the
question of framing an issue arise. Framing of issues is an extremely important stage
in a civil trial. Judges are expected to carefully examine the pleadings and documents
before framing of issues in a given case.
76. In pleadings, whenever a person claims right to continue in possession of another
property, it becomes necessary for him to plead with specificity about who was the
owner, on what date did he enter into possession, in what capacity and in what
manner did he conduct his relationship with the owner over the years till the date of
suit. He must also give details on what basis he is claiming a right to continue in
possession. Until the pleadings raise a sufficient case, they will not constitute
sufficient claim of defence."
(Emphasis supplied)
(ii) In A. Shanmugam v. Ariya Kshatriya Rajakula Vamsathu Madalaya Nandhavana Paripalanai
Sangam represented by its President etc., MANU/SC/0336/2012, the Supreme Court held as
under:-
"ENTIRE JOURNEY OF A JUDGE IS TO DISCERN THE TRUTH
24. The entire journey of a judge is to discern the truth from the pleadings,
documents and arguments of the parties. Truth is the basis of justice delivery system.
This Court in Dalip Singh v. State of U.P. and Ors. (2010) 2 SCC 114 observed that
truth constitutes an integral part of the justice delivery system which was in vogue in
pre-independence era and the people used to feel proud to tell truth in the courts
irrespective of the consequences. However, post-independence period has seen
drastic changes in our value system."
"26. As stated in the preceding paragraphs, the pleadings are foundation of litigation
but experience reveals that sufficient attention is not paid to the pleadings and
documents by the judicial officers before dealing with the case. It is the bounden duty
and obligation of the parties to investigate and satisfy themselves as to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 28Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
correctness and the authenticity of the matter pleaded.
27. The pleadings must set-forth sufficient factual details to the extent that it reduces
the ability to put forward a false or exaggerated claim or defence. The pleadings must
inspire confidence and credibility. If false averments, evasive denials or false denials
are introduced, then the Court must carefully look into it while deciding a case and
insist that those who approach the Court must approach it with clean hands."
"RESTITUTION AND MESNE PROFITS
34. Experience reveals that a large number of cases are filed on false claims or evasive
pleas are introduced by the defendant to cause delay in the administration of justice
and this can be sufficiently taken care of if the Courts adopt realistic approach
granting restitution. This Court in the case of Ramrameshwari Devi v. Nirmala Devi,
(2011) 8 SCC 249 (of which one of us, Bhandari, J. was the author of the judgment) in
paragraph 52 (C, D and G) of the judgment dealt with the aspect of imposition of
actual or realistic costs which are equally relevant for this case reads as under:
"C. Imposition of actual, realistic or proper costs and or ordering prosecution would
go a long way in controlling the tendency of introducing false pleadings and forged
and fabricated documents by the litigants. Imposition of heavy costs would also
control unnecessary adjournments by the parties. In appropriate cases the courts
may consider ordering prosecution otherwise it may not be possible to maintain
purity and sanctity of judicial proceedings.
D. The Court must adopt realistic and pragmatic approach in granting mesne profits.
The Court must carefully keep in view the ground realities while granting mesne
profits.
G. The principle of restitution be fully applied in a pragmatic manner in order to do
real and substantial justice."
35. Unless wrongdoers are denied profit or undue benefit from frivolous litigations, it would be
difficult to control frivolous and uncalled for litigations...We need to decide cases while keeping
pragmatic realities in view. We have to ensure that unscrupulous litigant is not permitted to derive
any benefit by abusing the judicial process."
"37. False averments of facts and untenable contentions are serious problems faced
by our courts. The other problem is that litigants deliberately create confusion by
introducing irrelevant and minimally relevant facts and documents. The court cannot
reject such claims, defences and pleas at the first look. It may take quite sometime, at
times years, before the court is able to see through, discern and reach to the truth.
More often than not, they appear attractive at first blush and only on a deeper
examination the irrelevance and hollowness of those pleadings and documents come
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 29Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
to light.
38. Our courts are usually short of time because of huge pendency of cases and at
times the courts arrive at an erroneous conclusion because of false pleas, claims,
defences and irrelevant facts. A litigant could deviate from the facts which are liable
for all the conclusions. In the journey of discovering the truth, at times, this Court, on
later stage, but once discovered, it is the duty of the Court to take appropriate
remedial and preventive steps so that no one should derive benefits or advantages by
abusing the process of law. The court must effectively discourage fraudulent and
dishonest litigants.
39. Now, when we revert to the facts of this case it becomes quite evident that the
appellant is guilty of suppressing material facts and introducing false pleas and
irrelevant documents. The appellant has also clouded the entire case with pleas which
have nothing to do with the main controversy involved in the case."
"FALSE AND IRRELEVANT PLEAS:
41. The appellant is also guilty of introducing untenable pleas. The plea of adverse
possession which has no foundation or basis in the facts and circumstances of the
case was introduced to gain undue benefit. The Court must be cautious in granting
relief to a party guilty of deliberately introducing irrelevant and untenable pleas
responsible for creating unnecessary confusion by introducing such documents and
pleas. These factors must be taken into consideration while granting relief and/or
imposing the costs."
The Supreme Court laid down the following principles:-
"42. On the facts of the present case, following principles emerge:
1. It is the bounden duty of the Court to uphold the truth and do justice.
2. Every litigant is expected to state truth before the law court whether it is pleadings,
affidavits or evidence. Dishonest and unscrupulous litigants have no place in law
courts.
3. The ultimate object of the judicial proceedings is to discern the truth and do
justice. It is imperative that pleadings and all other presentations before the court
should be truthful.
4. Once the court discovers falsehood, concealment, distortion, obstruction or
confusion in pleadings and documents, the court should in addition to full restitution
impose appropriate costs. The court must ensure that there is no incentive for wrong
doer in the temple of justice.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 30Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
Truth is the foundation of justice and it has to be the common endeavour of all to uphold the truth
and no one should be permitted to pollute the stream of justice.
5. It is the bounden obligation of the Court to neutralize any unjust and/or undeserved benefit or
advantage obtained by abusing the judicial process.
6. Watchman, caretaker or a servant employed to look after the property can never acquire interest
in the property irrespective of his long possession. The watchman, caretaker or a servant is under an
obligation to hand over the possession forthwith on demand. According to the principles of justice,
equity and good conscience, Courts are not justified in protecting the possession of a watchman,
caretaker or servant who was only allowed to live into the premises to look after the same.
7. The watchman, caretaker or agent holds the property of the principal only on behalf the principal.
He acquires no right or interest whatsoever in such property irrespective of his long stay or
possession.
8. The protection of the Court can be granted or extended to the person who has valid subsisting
rent agreement, lease agreement or licence agreement in his favour."
23. Sections 165 of Indian Evidence Act, 1872
(i) Section 165 of Indian Evidence Act empowers the Judge with plenary powers to put any question
to any witness or party; in any form, at any time, about any fact relevant or irrelevant. Section 165 is
intended to arm the Judge with the most extensive power possible for the purpose of getting at the
truth. The effect of this section is that in order to get to the bottom of the matter before it, the Court
will be able to look at and inquire into every fact and thus possibly acquire valuable indicative
evidence which may lead to other evidence strictly relevant and admissible. The Court is not,
however, permitted to found its judgment on any but relevant facts.
(ii) Section 165 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 reads as under:
"The Judge may, in order to discover or obtain proper proof of relevant facts, ask any
question he pleases, in any form, at any time, of any witness, or of the parties, about
any fact relevant or irrelevant; and may order the production of any document or
thing; and neither the parties nor their agents shall be entitled to make any objection
to any such question or order, nor, without the leave of the Court, to cross-examine
any witness upon any answer given in reply to any such question:
Provided that the judgment must be based upon facts declared by this Act to be
relevant, and duly proved:
Provided also that this section shall not authorize any Judge to compel any witness to
answer any question or to produce any document which such witness would be
entitled to refuse to answer or produce under Sections 121 to 131, both inclusive, if
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 31Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
the question were asked or the document were called for by the adverse party; nor
shall the Judge ask any question which it would be improper for any other person to
ask under Section 148 or 149 ; nor shall he dispense with primary evidence of any
document, except in the cases herein before excepted."
(iii) The object of a trial is, first to ascertain truth by the light of reason, and then, do justice upon
the basis of the truth and the Judge is not only justified but required to elicit a fact, wherever the
interest of truth and justice would suffer, if he did not.
(iv) The Judge contemplated by Section 165 is not a mere umpire at a wit-combat between the
lawyers for the parties whose only duty is to enforce the rules of the game and declare at the end of
the combat who has won and who has lost. He is expected, and indeed it is his duty, to explore all
avenues open to him in order to discover the truth and to that end, question witnesses on points
which the lawyers for the parties have either overlooked or left obscure or willfully avoided. A Judge,
who at the trial merely sits and records evidence without caring so to conduct the examination of the
witnesses that every point is brought out, is not fulfilling his duty.
(v) The scope of Section 165 of the Indian Evidence Act has been discussed by the Supreme Court
and High Courts in Ramchander v. State of Haryana, (1981) 3 SCC 191;
Ritesh Tewari v. State of Uttar Pradesh, (2010) 10 SCC 677; Zahira Habibulla H. Sheikh v. State of
Gujarat, (2004) 4 SCC 158; State of Rajasthan v. Ani, AIR 1997 SC 1023; Mohanlal Shamji Soni v.
Union of India, 1991 Supp. (1) SCC 271; Jamatraj Kewalji Govani v. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1968
SC 178; Jai Prakash v. National Insurance Company, (2010) 2 SCC 607; Somari Devi v.
Ragwar Singh, III (2010) ACC 147; and Sessions Judge Nellore Referring Officer v. Intha Ramana
Reddy, 1972 CriLJ 1485.
24. Findings Applying the aforesaid principles of law to the facts of the present case, the findings of
this Court are as under:-
(i) Vide agreement to sell dated 5th June, 1989, the plaintiff agreed to sell first,
second and terrace floors of the suit property to Mohinder Kaur for a total
consideration of `4,50,000/-. The plaintiff received the entire sale consideration
from Mohinder Kaur, handed over the vacant and peaceful possession to her and
simultaneously executed the agreement to sell, receipt, affidavit, will, indemnity bond
and irrevocable General Power of Attorney all dated 5th June, 1989. The plaintiff
declared in the agreement that she is not left with any right, title or interest in the
suit property. The plaintiff authorized defendant No.1 to make construction,
additions and alterations in the suit property. The General Power of Attorney
authorized the attorney to sell the suit property as well as to carry on additions and
alterations. Clause 19 of the General Power of Attorney declared it to be irrevocable.
The plaintiff also deposed on oath in her affidavit that she would not withdraw or
cancel any of the documents under any circumstances. The agreement to sell, receipt,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/72595235/ 32Hardip Kaur vs Kailash & Anr. on 18 May, 2012
indemnity bond and affidavit are legal, valid and subsisting and have not been
cancelled by the plaintiff. The plaintiff has no interest left in the suit property and,
therefore, cannot claim the possession or mesne profits in respect of the suit
property.
(ii) The agreement to sell „of itself(cid:128) may not create any interest in the property under
Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 but the agreement along with the
payment of the entire sale consideration, handing over of the possession, execution of
the receipt, affidavit, will, indemnity bond and irrevocable General Power of Attorney
create "an interest in the property" within the meaning of Section 202 of the Contract
Act.
(iii) The words "an interest in property which forms the subject matter of the agency"
in Section 202 of the Contract Act, 1872 are of wider amplitude than the words "an
interest in or charge on such property" in Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act,
1882. Where the seller has received the sale consideration in pursuance of the
agreement to sell and has delivered the possession to the purchaser, the purchaser
would have interest in the property within the meaning of Section 202 of the Contract
Act.
(iv) The Power of Attorney has been conferred not for the benefit of the plaintiff but for the benefit
of the agent representing the purchaser and not as representing the principal and, therefore, it is
irrevocable. The reason to appoint Surinder Jit Singh, the son and nominee of the purchaser,
obviously was that the attorney was regarded as a person interested in the purchaser rather than in
the plaintiff whose interest was opposed to that of the purchaser. It is only in law that the attorney
became an agent of the plaintiff. But this agency was only with a view to serve the purpose of the
purchaser. His interest in this transaction was the same as that of the purchaser. It was, therefore,
the interest of the attorney that the property which was the subject-matter of the agency should be
conveyed by the plaintiff to the purchaser.
(v) The Power of Attorney was granted only because an agreement to sell was entered in favour of
the purchaser. The attorney no less than the purchaser was, therefore, interested in the
subject-matter of the agency, namely, the suit property. If the agency was to be terminated,
prejudice would have been caused to the interest not only of the purchaser but also of the attorney.
(vi) The agreement to sell, General Power of Attorney, receipt, affidavit, will and indemnity bond
executed contemporaneously constitute one transaction and they have to be read and interpreted
together as if they are one document. The true nature of the transaction between the parties is the
agreement to transfer the suit property by the plaintiff to defendant No.1. There is no clause in any
of the documents that the plaintiff can claim back the possession of the suit property in any
situation. Rather, the plaintiff has agreed not to cancel/revoke any document and not to claim back
the possession under any circumstances. The plaintiff is, therefore, not entitled to recover the
possession of the suit property. If the plaintiff was aggrieved by any unauthorised construction, the
plaintiff(cid:128)s remedy was to seek injunction to stop the alleged unauthorized construction or to have

approached the Municipal Authorities to take action against the unauthorized construction.
(vii) The plaintiff has argued that the purchaser and her attorney are two different persons in the eye
of law. This may be so. But their interests are identical. It cannot be said that the attorney had no
interest in the property which is the subject-matter of the agency. The interest does not mean
ownership or title in the immovable property. It means an advantage or a benefit or a legally
enforceable right. The Power of Attorney was executed only to facilitate the execution of the sale
deed in favour of the purchaser and, therefore, the attorney was interested in the subject-matter of
agency, namely, the suit property.
(viii) The object of giving validity to a Power of Attorney given for consideration even after death of
the executants is to ensure that entitlement under such Power of Attorney remains because the same
is not a regular or a routine Power of Attorney but the same had elements of a commercial
transaction which cannot be allowed to be frustrated on account of death of the executant of the
Power of Attorney.
(ix) The purchaser would though not be the classical owner of the suit property as would an owner
be under a duly registered sale deed, but surely he would have better rights/entitlement of
possession of the suit property than the plaintiff. A right to possession of an immovable property
arises not only from a complete ownership right in the property but having a better title or a better
entitlement/right to the possession of the property than qua the person who is in actual physical
possession thereof.
(x) All the conditions of irrevocability are satisfied in the present case. The authority to the agent
was given for valuable consideration which proceeded from Mohinder Kaur. It was given to Surinder
Jit Singh, son and nominee of Mohinder Kaur to ensure and secure the performance of the contract
by the plaintiff in favour of Mohinder Kaur.
(xi) The General Power of Attorney dated 5 th June, 1989 is irrevocable in view of Section 202 of the
Contract Act. The plaintiff, therefore, had no right to terminate the said General Power of Attorney.
The General Power of Attorney is legal, valid and subsisting. The revocation of the General Power of
Attorney by plaintiff is, therefore, of no consequence.
(xii) The defendants are protected by Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and,
therefore, the plaintiff is not entitled to the recovery of possession of the suit property.
(xiii) The mere fact that the defendants did not file a Counter- claim or suit for specific performance
cannot lead to a conclusion that they have given up all their rights in the suit property. It can, at
best, be said that the defendants have lost the opportunity of perfecting their title but it would not
entitle the plaintiff to claim the possession.
(xiv) Except for the two limited grounds mentioned in para 16 above, the plaintiff has not even
challenged the other findings of the learned Trial Court mentioned in paras 13 and 15 above.

(xv) The plaintiff has made absolutely false and incorrect statements on oath before the Trial Court.
The plaintiff has made false statements on oath in the plaint as well as in her deposition as PW-1
that she agreed to sell only first and second floors of the suit property to defendant No.1 whereas the
agreement to sell, affidavit, indemnity bond and Will dated 5th June, 1989 admitted by the plaintiff
clearly records that she had sold the first, second and terrace floors of the suit property to defendant
No.1. The plaintiff has failed to prove unauthorized construction alleged to have been raised by the
defendants on the terrace floor. The plaintiff neither received any notice of unauthorized
construction from any authority nor issued any such notice to the defendants. The plaintiff did not
make any complaint to any authority. The plaintiff also admitted that defendant No.1 had sold the
suit property to defendants No.2 and 3 who were in possession. If that is so, it is false that defendant
No.1 had carried out any unauthorized construction. The plaintiff admitted in her cross-examination
that she cancelled her General Power of Attorney and Will because the defendants misbehaved with
her. The plaintiff has also violated the solemn statement made on oath in her affidavit dated 5th
June, 1989 that she will not revoke any of the documents under any circumstances and shall never
demand the possession. The plaintiff has questioned the interest of the defendants under the
agreement to sell whereas she herself was holding the title under the construction agreement and
General Power of Attorney.
25. False claims and defences are really serious problems with real estate litigation, predominantly
because of ever escalating prices of the real estate. Litigation pertaining to valuable real estate
properties is dragged on by unscrupulous litigants in the hope that the other party will tire out and
ultimately would settle with them by paying a huge amount. It is a matter of common experience
that Court's otherwise scarce time is consumed or more appropriately, wasted in a large number of
uncalled for cases.
26. It is the duty of the Courts to see that such wrong doers are discouraged at every step and even if
they succeed in prolonging the litigation, ultimately they must suffer the costs of all these years long
litigation. Imposition of actual, realistic or proper costs and/or ordering prosecution in appropriate
cases would go a long way in controlling the tendency of filing false cases.
27. Conclusion On consideration of totality of the facts and circumstances of this case, I do not find
any infirmity in the well reasoned impugned judgment. The plaintiff has misused the process of law
by raising a false claim. The plaintiff has no respect for truth and has made false statements on oath.
The plaintiff has shamelessly resorted to falsehood and has attempted to pollute the pure fountain of
justice with tainted hands and, therefore, the plaintiff is not entitled to any relief. This case is
squarely covered by the above mentioned judgments and warrants prosecution as well as imposition
of penal costs on the plaintiff. However, considering that the Courts are already overburdened,
directing prosecution of the plaintiff would further burden the system. This appeal is consequently
dismissed with costs of `2,00,000/- on the appellant. The cost be paid by the appellant to the
respondents within four weeks.
