(in Writ C No.30448 of 2013), and Rs.1,60,920/- (in Writ C No.30451 of 2013) as price of the

3. Shri D.K. Pandey, appearing for the petitioners submits that the District Consumer Forum did not
have jurisdiction to entertain the claim for the price of the potatoes kept in the cold storage of the
petitioners, which the petitioners had stored in the year 2009 on the ground that such remedy is
specifically provided under U.P. Regulation of Cold Storage Act, 1976 (for short the Act), which was
enacted by the State of UP for licensing, supervision and control of cold storage in Uttar Pradesh
and for matters connected therewith. He submits that the Act provides for special remedies under
Sections 24 and 25 of the Act for compensation for loss, destruction and to decide the dispute
regarding compensation to be referred by the Licensing Officer, subject to appeal under Section 36
of the Act.
4. It is further submitted that the storage of the potatoes by the farmers in cold storage is for
commercial purpose for which a claim petition cannot be filed in the Consumer Forum. The services
offered by the cold storage in such case will fall in the exception under Section 2 (1) (d) (ii) of the
Consumer Protection Act, which excludes the consumers of commercial purpose from the definition
of consumers, for invoking remedies under the Act. In the present case the farmers had kept their
agriculture produce in the cold storage for hire. They were required to pay the price for protection of
the potatoes, and thus they were consumers for commercial purpose.
5. Shri D.K. Pandey has relied on a judgment of Supreme Court in General Manager, Telecom vs. M.
Krishnan & another, Civil Appeal No.7687 of 2004 decided on 1.9.2009, in which the Supreme
Court, in view of the special remedies provided under Section 7-B of the Indian Telegraph Act
regarding disputes in respect of telephone bills, held that in such case the remedy under the
Consumer Protection Act is by implication barred. The Supreme Court held that special law
overrides the old law and hence the High Court was not correct in its approach. The Supreme Court
referred upon a decision in Chairman, Thiruvalluvar Transport Corporation vs. Consumer
Protection Council (1995) 2 SCC 479 in which it was held that the National Commission has no
jurisdiction to adjudicate upon claims for compensation arising out of motor vehicles accidents.
Reliance has also been placed on some interim orders granted by this Court in such matters.
6. In the present case, the petitioners took up a defence in the District Consumer Forum that they
were co-owners of the cold storage, which they had sold in the year 2009. The complainant has not
produced the receipt, but only a gate pass and has not produced the Patti to establish that he had
given the potatoes valued at Rs.1,50,500/- and Rs. 1,35,920/- to be kept in the cold storage.
7. The U.P. Regulation of Cold Storage Act, 1976 is a special Act enacted by the State of UP in the
year 1976 for licensing, supervision and control of cold storage in UP and for matters connected
therewith. Sections 24 and 25 of the Act provide as follows:-
"24. Compensation for loss, destruction, etc.- Except as otherwise provided in this Act the licensee
shall be liable to pay to the hirer compensation for every loss, destruction, damage, deterioration or
non-delivery of the goods stored in his cold storage caused by the negligence, misconduct or default
on the part of such licensee.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/171097227/ 2Subodh Chandel And Another vs The President Distt.Consumers ... on 28 May, 2013
25. Dispute regarding compensation to be referred to the Licensing Officer- (1) Every dispute
regarding compensation payable by the licensee under Section 24 shall be referred to the Licensing
Officer, and subject to the result of appeal, if any, under Section 36, the order of the Licensing
Officer shall be final.
(2) When the Licensing Officer is satisfied that any compensation payable by a licensee under
sub-section (1) has not been paid within thirty days from the date of the order under sub-section (1)
or, as the case may be, from the date of the decision of the Tribunal under Section 36, he shall issue
a certificate of recovery to the Collector, and the Collector shall recover the amount of such
compensation together with costs of recovery as arrears of land revenue and pay the amount
realised, after deduction of costs, to the hirer."
8. The Act under Section 24 fixes liability of compensation on the hirer for every loss, destruction,
damage, deterioration or non-delivery of the goods stored in his cold storage caused by the
negligence, misconduct or default on the part of such licensee. Section 25 provides for reference of
the dispute by the Licensing Officer with a right of appeal under Section 36 of the Act.
9. The U.P. Regulation of Cold Storage Act, 1976 is a State Act which was enacted prior to the
Consumer Protection Act, 1986 (a Central Act). The U.P. Regulation of Cold Storage Act, 1976 was
not reserved nor any assent was given to it by President of India.
10. The question as to whether the jurisdiction of the Consumer Forums under the Consumer
Protection Act, 1986 can be invoked where special remedies are provided for
compensation/damages under any State Acts or Central Acts came up for consideration of the
Supreme Court in Trans Mediterranean Airways vs. Universal Exports and another (2011) 10 SCC
316. The Supreme Court held that the Consumer Protection Act aims to protect the interests of the
consumers and to provide for speedy resolutions of their disputes with regard to defective goods or
deficiency of service. Section 3 of the Act provides that the provisions of the Act shall be in addition
to and not in derogation of any other law, and reads as follows:-
"3. Act not in derogation of any other law.- The provisions of this Act shall be in addition to and not
in derogation of the provisions of any other law for the time being in force"
11. The Supreme Court held that the framework of the Consumer Protection Act was provided by a
resolution dated 9.4.1985 of the General Assembly of United Nations Organisation which is
commonly known as Consumer Protection Resolution No.39/248. India is signatory to the said
resolution. The Act was enacted in view of the afore-mentioned resolution of General Assembly of
the United Nations. The Preamble to the Act suggests that it is to provide better protection for the
consumers and their interests. The legislature has constituted quasi judicial tribunals/Commissions
as an alternative system of adjudicating consumer disputes. Section 3 of the Act gives an additional
remedy for deficiency of service and that remedy is not in derogation of any other remedy under any
other law. In para 41 of the judgment the Supreme Court held:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/171097227/ 3Subodh Chandel And Another vs The President Distt.Consumers ... on 28 May, 2013
"In our view, the protection provided under the C.P. Act to consumers is in addition to the remedies
available under any other statute. It does not extinguish the remedies under another statute, but
provided an additional or alternative remedy."
12. Similar view was taken in Jabalpur Tractors v. Sedmal Jainarain 1995 Supp (4) SCC 107 and Fair
Air Engineers (P) Ltd v. N.K. Modi (1996) 6 SCC 385. In State of Karnataka v. Vishwabharathi
House Building Coop. Society (2003) 2 SCC 412 a three-Judge Bench of Supreme Court observed in
paragraph 16 as follows:-
"16.....inasmuch as the provisions of the said Act are in addition to the provisions of any other law
for the time being in force and not in derogation thereof as is evident from Section 3 thereof"
13. The Supreme Court relied on its earlier judgments and reiterated the jurisdiction of the
Consumer Fora under Consumer Protection Act, 1986 in Thirumurugan Coop. Agricultural Credit
Society v. M. Lalitha (2004) 1 SCC 305; Kishore Lal v. ESI Corp (2007) 4 SCC 579 (para 17); Skypak
Couriers Ltd v. Tata Chemicals Ltd (2000) 5 SCC 294; Patel Roadways Ltd. v. Birla Yamaha Ltd
(2000) 4 SCC 91; H.N. Shankara Shastry vs. Director of Agriculture (204) 6 SCC 230 and National
Seeds Corporation Ltd vs. M. Madhusudan Reddy (2012) 2 SCC 506 (para 57). The Supreme Court
has subsequent to its decision by two Hon'ble Judges in General Manager, Telecom vs. M. Krishnan
and another dated 1.9.2009 held in the above quoted decisions that the remedies under the
Consumer Protection Act are in addition to and /or not in derogation to any other remedies
provided under any other law. What follows is that the respondents in the present case, even if there
are special remedies available to them under UP Regulation of Cold Storage Act, 1976 which
provides for deciding the disputes of compensation, could have approahced the Consumer Forum
under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 for compensation and damages for any deficiency in
service by the cold storage as a service provider to the claimants as farmers, who are consumers of
such services. On these later judicial pronouncements, by benches of larger strength the argument,
that the special remedies provided under the General Act would bar the jurisdiction of Consumer
Forum has no substance and is liable to be rejected.
14. It was next contended that the farmers keeping their potatoes in the cold storage avail the
facilities which are commercial in nature and thus the farmers in such case would not fall within the
definition of consumer under Section 2 (1) (d) of the Act.
15. In National Seeds Corporation Limited vs. M. Madhusudhan Reddy and another (2012) 2 SCC
506 in somewhat similar facts where the farmers had allowed the National Seeds Corporation
Limited, a Government of India company to arrange for production of quality seeds of different
varieties in the farms of registered growers and supply the same to the farmers, the Supreme Court
held that where the farmers/growers agreed to produce seeds on behalf of seed seller for the
purpose of earning their livelihood by self-employment by using their skill and labour, the purpose
cannot be said to be commercial purpose and that they would certainly fall within the ambit of
Explanation to Section 2 (1) (d) of the Consumer Protection Act. The explanation excludes the use by
a consumer of goods used by him exclusively for the purpose of earning his livelihood by means of
self-employment. This exclusion will include farmers, who store their goods grown by them
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/171097227/ 4Subodh Chandel And Another vs The President Distt.Consumers ... on 28 May, 2013
temporarily in a cold storage. The Explanation reads:-
"Explanation- For the purpose of sub clause (i) 'commercial purpose', does not include use by a
consumer of goods bought and used by him exclusively for the purpose of earning his livelihood, by
means of self employment; (The explanation was substituted w.e.f. 15.3.2003 by Consumer
Protection (Amendment) Act 2002 (62 of 2002)."
16. The use of service by the service provider, where the consumer hires and avails any service for a
consideration, which has been paid or promised or partly paid or partly promised or under any
other system of deferred payment and which includes any beneficiary of such services other than the
person, who hires or avails the services for consideration for any commercial purpose, is included
within the definition of consumer under Section 2 (1) (d) (ii) of the Consumer Protection Act. A
farmer, who stores his agricultural produce in the cold storage for hire, to be taken out at a later
point of time for getting a higher return would thus fall within the explanation to Section 2 (1) (d) of
the Act. The goods produced by him stored in a cold storage for hire to be taken out at a later point
of time for sale for all purposes would fall within the explanation as the storage of goods is for the
purposes of earning his livelihood by means of self-employment.
17. The submission, that the hiring of cold storage by farmers is a commercial use, is also liable to be
rejected.
18. On the aforesaid facts and legal position, we relegate the petitioners to the remedy of filing an
appeal against the judgment on merits of the case to the State Consumer Commission.
19. The writ petitions are dismissed on the ground of alternative remedy of statutory appeal
provided under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
