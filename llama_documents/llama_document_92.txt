03/05/2023 Pronoucned on: 21/12/2023
1. The present cross Sales Tax Revisions / References (for short "STRs"), under Section 84 of the
Rajasthan Value Added Tax Act, 2003 (for short "RVAT Act"), are filed being aggrieved by the order
dated 19.03.2020 passed by the Larger Bench of the Rajasthan Tax Board, Ajmer (for short "RTB")
in Appeal No. 1454- 1456/2014/Kota, and were admitted on following questions of law:
In STR Nos. 217-219/2020, preferred by the assessee: -
"(i) Whether the learned Tax Board has legally erred in setting aside order passed by
the DS(Appeals) and thereby holding that the contracts between BGR, Chennai and
RRVUNL as a composite and indivisible contract which tantamounts to a works
contract?
(ii) Whether the learned Tax Board has legally erred in holding that sale of Onshore
Goods and Offshore Goods made by BGR-Chennai, BGR-Gurarat and BGR-
Maharashtra to RRVUNL as intra-state sale by BGR- Rajasthan to RRVUNL and accordingly to be
taxed under RVAT Act instead of CST?
(iii) Whether in facts and circumstances of the case, the Respondent Department having assessed
the transaction under Entry tax as goods brought by RRVUNL into the state, is estopped from
contending that the sale of the said goods was made by BGR, Rajasthan to RRVUNL in the state of
Rajasthan?
(iv) Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, the learned Tax Board has grossly erred in
holding the State of Rajasthan can levy RVAT on a sale transaction when the assessment in relation
to [2023:RJ-JP:23645] (4 of 45) [STR-217/2020] the said sale transaction has already been
completed under CST Act in the state of Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Gujarat?"
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74366714/ 2Assistant Commissioner vs M/S B.G.R. Energy Systems Ltd on 21 December, 2023
In STR Nos. 155-157/2020, preferred by the revenue: -
"1. Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case the larger bench of the
Rajasthan Tax Board was justified in giving directions beyond the scope of the
questions framed and referred to them?
2. Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case the larger bench of the
Rajasthan Tax Board was justified in giving direction with regard to goods of special
importance under Section 14 of the CST Act when no such claim was made by the
assessee before the Assessing Officer as well as appellate authority?
3. Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case the larger bench of the
Rajasthan Tax Board was justified in law in remanding the matter back with regard to
goods of special importance under Section 14 of CST Act which were never
transferred to the assessee in the form as mentioned under Section 14 and in such
circumstances the benefit is not available?
4. Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case the larger bench of the
Rajasthan Tax Board was justified in law in confirming deletion of penalty despite of
the fact that the assessee has created documents to convert the local sale into
interstate transaction with the intention to evade/avoid tax?"
FACTS/BACKGROUND
2. The brief facts, leading to filing of the present STRs are as follows:
2.1. On 13.08.2007, Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited (for short "RVUNL")
issued a notice inviting tender (for [2023:RJ-JP:23645] (5 of 45) [STR-217/2020]
short "NIT") for bid for setting up of two units of 600 MW each at Kalisindh Thermal
Power Project (for short "Project") on Engineering, Procurement and Commissioning
(for short "EPC") basis. The assessee ("BGRESL, Chennai") tendered a single bid
against a single NIT to win this contract.
2.2. In pursuance thereof, and as desired by RVUNL, the assessee had to execute the
following three separate contracts with RVUNL:
(a) Contract No. 3832 for procurement and supply of material required from out of
India (for short "Offshore Goods")
(b) Contract No. 3833 for procurement and supply of material required from within
India (for short "Onshore Goods")
(c) Contract No. 3834 for providing services and doing civil work.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74366714/ 3Assistant Commissioner vs M/S B.G.R. Energy Systems Ltd on 21 December, 2023
2.3. The cause and controversy in the matter arose on 19.01.2012, when a survey was conducted at
the business premises of the assessee at Village Undal, Tehsil-Jhalrapatan, Distt. Jhalawar by the
ACTO, Ward-II, Anti Evasion, Kota. The Surveying Authority, in furtherance of the survey, prepared
a detailed inspection report dated 27.06.2012 to opine that breaking a composite and indivisible
work contract into three contract is nothing but a colourable device to avoid the tax due under the
RVAT Act. It was further opined that the sale made under the first and second contract are
intra-state sales, i.e. sale within the State of Rajasthan and not inter-state sales under Section 3 read
with Section 6 of Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 (for short "CST Act"). [2023:RJ-JP:23645] (6 of 45)
[STR-217/2020] 2.4. On the basis of survey and inspection report, the assessment order(s) were
passed on 14.06.2013 wherein tax, interest, and penalty were levied on the assessee under the RVAT
Act on 'deemed sale of goods' in execution of works contract. 2.5. The Appellate Authority, vide
order dated 11.02.2014, quashed the assessment and demand orders and held that the sale made by
the assessee is inter-state sale covered under Section 3 read with Section 6 of CST Act, and hence
not exigible to state taxation.
2.6. The RTB, vide impugned order dated 19.03.2020, held that the contract between the parties
was a composite and indivisible one and the disputed sale involved were intra-state sale and
therefore affirmed the power of state government to levy VAT on the same.
2.7. The specific issues framed by the RTB were answered as under:
"Question 1) (cid:128) Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case the contract
between BGRESL and RUVN is a composite and indivisible one tantamounting to a
Works Contract?
(cid:128) Or there exist three separate contracts- One for supply of offshore goods, Second
for supply of onshore goods and the Third for rendering of services and doing Civil
Work?
(cid:128) What difference does it make on tax liability of the respondent or applicability of
provisions of the Local Act or the CST Act, if we treat the contract a single Works
Contract or three separate contracts as above?
(cid:128) Is making of three separate contracts attributable to the respondent? Did the
respondent manage three separate contracts with RUVN only to avoid or evade tax?
Could the respondent be [2023:RJ-JP:23645] (7 of 45) [STR-217/2020] held
responsible for penalty under Section 61 of RVAT Act for this mode contracting?
Answer to Question 1) (cid:128) The subject contracts between BGRESL and RVUN form an
indivisible contract which tantamount to a Works Contract.
(cid:128) There do not exist three separate contracts involving supply of goods and rendering
of services.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74366714/ 4Assistant Commissioner vs M/S B.G.R. Energy Systems Ltd on 21 December, 2023
(cid:128) All the Constitutional and Statutory restrictions are applicable on 'deemed sale' of
the goods involved in a Works Contract.
(cid:128) Making of three separate contracts could not be attributed to the respondent and it
could not be held liable for penalty under Section 61 of RVAT Act for reasons
mentioned in this order.
Question 2) (cid:128) Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, use of the plants
and equipment imported by BGRESL from out of India in erection and installation of
power plant for RVUN is a 'sale' or 'a deemed to be sale' as defined under Article
366(29A) (b) of the Constitution?
(cid:128) Whether this 'sale' or 'deemed to be sale' is an inter-State sale effected by the
respondent from Gujarat/Maharashtra or an intra- state sale of Rajasthan?
Answer to Question 2) (cid:128) Use of plants and equipment in erection and installation of
power plants for RVUN by BGRESL under a contract constitute a 'deemed to be sale'
defined under Article 366(29A)(b) of the Constitution and Section 2(35)(ii) of RVAT
Act, 2003.
(cid:128) Sale of offshore goods claimed by the respondent from Gujarat and Maharashtra is
an intra-state sale of Rajasthan.
Question 3) (cid:128) Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, the purchase of
equipment and materials by the respondent from various vendors located in different
States and resale of the same to [2023:RJ-JP:23645] (8 of 45) [STR-217/2020]
RVUN is a sale as described under Clause (b) of Section 3 of CST Act?
(cid:128) In case the sale between BGRESL, Chennai and RVUN is a sale under clause (b) of
Section 3, is it also a sale by BGRESL, Chennai exempted under Section 6(2) of CST
Act?
(cid:128) In case the sale does not fulfill requirements of Section 3(b) or Section 6(2) or both,
is it taxable under the provisions of RVAT Act?
Answer to Question 3) (cid:128) Purchase of onshore goods and subsequent sale of the same
to RVUN does not constitute a sale as described under clause (b) of Section 3 CST
Act.
(cid:128) The sale not qualifying under Section 3(b) automatically disqualified under Section
6(2) of CST Act. The subject sales are taxable under RVAT Act on being denuded the
inter-State sale or export sale."

2.8. However, considering that the goods were 'goods of special importance' as per Section 14 of CST
Act, while setting aside the penalty, the RTB remanded the matter back to the assessing authority
with the following directions:
"14. All the references made by the Learned Division Bench has been specifically
answered by us as above. In view of this the D.B. will have nothing to decide or
redecide in the matter afresh except to remand the case to the Assessing Officer for
consideration of applicability of lower rate of tax on the sale of goods of special
importance and reduced rate on other goods in light of Notification No.
F.12(63)FD/TAX/2005-27 dated 28.4.2006. For the sake of early justice, instead of
remitting the case to learned D.B., we set aside orders of the lower authorities and
remand the cases back to the Assessing Officer to decide them afresh in the light of
observation made in the judgment as under-
(i) All the purchases of goods of special importance be (as defined under Section 14 of
CST Act) ascertained from [2023:RJ-JP:23645] (9 of 45) [STR-217/2020] purchase
invoices. Corresponding sales of these goods under all the three contracts be assessed
to tax at the rate prescribed and applicable under Section 15 of CST Act in the
relevant period.
(ii) The respondent should be given full opportunity to prove that claim of reduced
rate of tax under F.12(63)FD/TAX/2005-
27 dated 28.4.2006 like submission of any forms, certificates etc. with respect to all the sales made
under the three contracts, and
(iii) The respondent will not be liable to pay any penalty u/s 61 of RVAT Act, 2003. But any
unassessed tax found paid short or belated shall carry interest as per law.
(iv) The AO is directed to finalise the reassessment within three months' time from receipt of
judgment."
3. The assessee has challenged the merits and validity of the entire RTB order and the revenue is
aggrieved by the setting aside of penalty and direction of remand for recalculation of tax on
concessional rate on goods of special impotance. It is in this context that these STRs, which arises
out of the common RTB order, were heard and are now being decided by way of this common order.
SUBMISSIONS OF ASSESSEE
4. Learned Senior Counsel, Mr. Sanjay Jhanwar, questioning the correctness of the impugned order
of the RTB in its entirety, submitted as follows:
4.1. The first contention of the assessee is that the State/revenue has no jurisdiction
to tax the subject sales under the RVAT Act as the same are inter-state sales covered
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74366714/ 6Assistant Commissioner vs M/S B.G.R. Energy Systems Ltd on 21 December, 2023
under Section 3 of CST Act. In support of this contention, learned senior counsel
made the following submissions:
[2023:RJ-JP:23645] (10 of 45) [STR-217/2020]
(a) The bid/tended issued by RVUNL itself prescribed that three separate contracts
would be awarded to the successful bidder, i.e., one for supply of off-shore goods; one
for supply of on-shore goods; and one for civil works. The RRVUNL had prescribed
the complete procedure to be followed by the petitioner while executing the contracts
for supply of off-shore and on-shore goods. Even the vendors from whom the goods
were to be procured in both these contracts were identified by the RRVUNL.
(b) That the above mentioned two supply contracts (both On-shore and off-shore)
occasioned movement of goods from one state to another and were duly assessed to
tax under the provisions of CST in the hands of petitioner's branches at Maharashtra,
Gujarat, and Chennai. Further, the supply contracts were issued by RVUNL inter alia
providing for cost of CST.
(c) That the title of the goods was transferred outside the state of Rajasthan, which is
evident from Clause 31.3 of BID/NIT.
(d) That even for the sake of argument, it is assumed that the subject sales were made
by the Rajasthan branch of the assessee, even in that case, by virtue of movement of
goods from one state to another, the subject sales would be inter-state sale not liable
to tax under the RVAT Act.
(e) Reliance is placed on Apex Court judgments of Hyderabad Engineering Vs. State
of AP: (2011) 4 SCC 705, English Electric Vs. Dy. CTO: (1976) 4 SCC 460 and CDVAT
Vs. ABB Ltd.: AIR 2016 SC 1901 to submit that the only condition to be satisfied for
the purpose of establishing inter-state sale under Section 3 of CST is movement of
goods from one state [2023:RJ-JP:23645] (11 of 45) [STR-217/2020] to another and
any condition or qualification vis-à-vis the place of delivery, situs of sale, point of
passing of property, time and place of raising invoice, intervention of agent, etc. are
immaterial in case of inter-state sale. Reliance is also placed on Oil India Ltd.
Vs. Supdt. Of Taxes: (1975) 1 SCC 733, 20 th Century Finance Vs. State of Maha.: AIR 2000 SC
2436, Thyseenkrupp Elevator Vs. ACCT: (2019) 60 GSTR 355 (Karn.), Asea Brown Boveri Vs. State
of Kar.: 2014 (79) KarLJ 241, State of Kar. Vs. ECE Industries: (2006) 144 STC 605 (Karn.) and
Sahney Steel and Press Works Vs. CTO: AIR 1985 SC 1754.
(f) That the Rajasthan branch of the assessee merely acted as a bailee and therefore handing over of
goods by the Rajasthan branch to RVUNL can in no circumstance be considered a sale. Even
otherwise, since the RTB has held the import of off- shore goods as 'seamless import', the same
would be covered under Section 5(2) of CST Act and the petitioner would not be liable to pay any
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74366714/ 7Assistant Commissioner vs M/S B.G.R. Energy Systems Ltd on 21 December, 2023
tax.
(g) That the off-shore goods were custom made for the RVUNL, which were only fit for use in the
project. Further, the same were dispatched after inspection and issuance of Material Dispatch
Clearance Certificate (for short "MDCC") by RVUNL which further establishes that the movement of
the goods occasioned from outside of Rajasthan into the State of Rajasthan and the title thereto was
also transferred to RVUNL during this transfer. 4.2. The second contention of the assessee is that
even in case of works contract, the State/revenue does not have the [2023:RJ-JP:23645] (12 of 45)
[STR-217/2020] power to tax a sale in terms of Article 366(29-A)(b) of the Constitution of India, if
such a sale is an inter-state sale. In support of this contention, learned senior counsel for the
assessee made the following submissions:
(a) That Article 366(29-A)(b) of the Constitution of India does not provide for tax on
the whole of works contract. In works contract, assessee is liable to pay service tax on
service element and sales tax on goods deemed to be transferred. However, what is
ultimately being taxed by the State is the 'sale or purchase of goods' simpliciter. Prior
to insertion of Article 366(29-A)(b) into the Constitution of India by way of 46 th
Constitutional Amendment, state government did not have power to tax the 'sale of
goods' elements involved in a works contract. Article 366(29-A)
(b) of the Constitution of India merely empowers the state government to separate
the sale of goods element involved in a works contract and to levy tax on the same.
Article 366(29-A)(b) of the Constitution of India does not provide for levy of tax on
whole of works contract.
(c) A works contract is no exception to inter-state sales. It has been held in Builders'
Association of India vs. Union of India: (1989) 2 SCC 645 that Article 366(29-A)(b) of
the Constitution of India only empowers the state to tax sale of goods involved in
works contract but all the Constitutional restrictions under Article 286 and Entry
92A of Union List would apply on the same. Therefore, revenue has no power to tax
sale of goods involved in execution of works contract as the same have been supplied
during inter-state sales. Reliance is placed on Hon'ble [2023:RJ-JP:23645] (13 of 45)
[STR-217/2020] Supreme Court judgments of Gannon Dunkerley and Co. Vs. State of
Rajasthan: (1993) 1 SCC 364, Indure Ltd. vs. CTO (2010) 9 SCC 461, judgments of
Kerala High Court in State of Kerela vs. M/s Metso Mineral India Pvt Ltd. (O.T. Rev.
No. 143/2017; decided on 19.07.2020) and Swaraj Equipments (P) Ltd. vs. State of
Kerela (S.T. Rev. No. 49/2013 and O.T. Rev Nos. 62/2013, 73/2013; decided on
13.07.2018), judgments of High Court of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in
Engineers India Ltd. vs. State of A.P. & Ors.: 2019 (2) ALT 168, and L&T Ltd. vs.
Commissioner of Commercial Taxes:
(2003) 132 STC 272 (AP) and judgment of Gauhati High Court in Projects and
Services Centre v. State of Tripura: 1990 SCC OnLine Gau 191.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74366714/ 8Assistant Commissioner vs M/S B.G.R. Energy Systems Ltd on 21 December, 2023
(d) That RVUNL may have deducted works contract TDS on amount of all the three
contracts combined, however, in the assessment order VAT has been levied only on
the value of the goods. It was only as a matter of procedure that RVUNL deducted
works contract TDS in accordance with provisions of Section 20 of RVAT Act read
with Rule 40 of RVAT Rules on the payment made to the assessee in respect of the
supply contracts. However, the assessee never admitted liability of said TDS in its
returns. On the other hand, since no tax on account of works contract was liable to be
paid, the assessee later on claimed refund on the entire works contract TDS amount
with respect to supply of off-shore and on-shore goods. The deduction of TDS cannot
change the nature of inter-state sales made by the assessee.
[2023:RJ-JP:23645] (14 of 45) [STR-217/2020]
(e) That RVUNL itself had issued three separate contracts and the contract for supply of goods were
issued considering the liability under the CST Act and RVUNL itself issued C-Forms and Form
VAT-47, which evidences that the supply of goods was inter- state. Without prejudice to his
arguments on merits, it is submitted that had RVUNL prescribed in the bid or otherwise directed
the assessee to pay tax considering the three separate contract as one single works contract
supplying goods within the state of Rajasthan and chargeable to RVAT, the assessee would have
opted to pay RVAT at a concessional rate under the works contract exemption scheme during the
relevant period. On the other hand, the assessee merely followed the manner and procedure
prescribed by RVUNL for execution of the three contracts and has paid far greater amount of tax
against CST sales in respect of supply of off-shore and on-shore goods.
(f) That RTB gravely erred in not considering that power to tax sale of goods during execution of
works contract is available with the State of Rajasthan under Article 246 read with Entry 54 of List
II just like any other transaction of sale or purchase taking place inside a state. In other words, the
existence of a works contract does not change the fact that what is ultimately being taxed is sale and
purchase of goods, which is subject to provisions of Article 286, Entry 92A of List-I of Constitution
of India and the CST Act.
(g) That this Court had struck down the provision in the erstwhile Rajasthan Sales Tax Act, 1994
which attempted to bring tax on inter-state sale of goods involved in the execution of works
[2023:RJ-JP:23645] (15 of 45) [STR-217/2020] contract in the case of Triveni Engineering and
Industries Ltd. v. State: (2001) 3 RLW 1752.
4.3. The third contention of the assessee is that because the subject sales have been assessed to tax
under the CST Act, the same cannot be taxed again under the RVAT Act. In support of this
contention, learned senior counsel for the assessee made the following submissions:
(a) That it is undisputed in the present case that the subject sales under both the
supply contract have been assessed to tax under the CST Act in the hands of the
assessee in respective states of Tamil Nadi, Maharashtra and Gujarat. The said fact
has also been recorded in the impugned RTB order. However, disregarding the same
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74366714/ 9Assistant Commissioner vs M/S B.G.R. Energy Systems Ltd on 21 December, 2023
without any cogent reason, the subject sales have been subjected to tax again under
the RVAT Act, which is constitutionally impermissible. Reliance is placed on Hon'ble
Supreme Court judgment of Ashok Leyland Ltd. vs. State of Tamil Nadu and Ors.:
AIR 2004 SC 2836.
(b) That revenue is taking contradictory stand in the matter as the revenue had itself
issued Form-C under Section 8 of CST to RVUNL and has also accepted Form
VAT-47 in terms of Rule 53 of RVAT Rules from RVUNL in respect to subject sales. It
is contended that issuance of these forms is prima facie evidence of the fact that the
revenue has held RVUNL to be owner of the goods which have been brought from
outside the state of Rajasthan.
4.4. The fourth contention of the assessee is that since the subject sales have already been assessed
to tax under the [2023:RJ-JP:23645] (16 of 45) [STR-217/2020] Rajasthan Tax on Entry of Goods
Into Local Area Act, 1999 (for short "Entry Tax Act") in the hands of RVUNL, the same cannot be
taxed again under RVAT Act at the hands of assessee. It is further contended that the fact that the
revenue collected entry tax from RVUNL goes to show that the revenue had accepted RVUNL as the
owner of the goods and also the fact that the goods have been sold to RVUNL in the course of
inter-state trade. Further, Notification No. F.12(63)FD/Tax/2005-160 dated 31.03.2006, issued by
Revenue itself, provided exemption from entry tax if tax under the RVAT Act has been paid. Thus,
entry tax and VAT are mutually exclusive and since entry tax on subject sales has already been paid
by RVUNL, it is a revenue neutral situation, hence, RVAT cannot be demanded from the petitioner.
4.5. The fifth contention of the assessee is that the assessee had duly rebutted and clarified the
alleged discrepancies or irregularities pointed out by the assessing officer based on which the
impugned assessment order was passed. Learned Senior Counsel for the assessee submits that the
sole ground of the assessing authority in rejecting the inter-state sales was that there were several
discrepancies in the document transferring title of goods and that the invoices were raised late after
the goods had already reached the Power Project site. However, the rebuttal and clarification of the
assessee was found satisfactory by the Appellate Authority and the same has not been controverted
by the RTB either. The Assessing Authority imposed penalty on the basis of only one transaction
alleged to be an intra-state sale from Bhiwadi, Rajasthan. The allegation is erroneous because as per
[2023:RJ-JP:23645] (17 of 45) [STR-217/2020] the contract issued by RVUNL the said supply was
to be made from a vendor situated out of Rajasthan and was accordingly procured by the Petitioner
from Himachal Pradesh, and the Assessing Authority has erroneously relied upon one inspection
report which does not pertain to said supply, which is evident from the documents on record itself.
Even otherwise, all the document, nature of business and explanation is on record, suggesting that
there is no illegality or fabrication or anti-dating of documents. At the best, revenue may plead that
the documents were not to the satisfaction. However, that does not alter the 'substantive' character
of sales as the principle of 'Substantive Form' is well settled.
4.6. The sixth contention of assessee is that it is unfair for the State to first mandate the charging of
CST on the supply of offshore and onshore goods and charging of RVAT only on local supplies while
floating the tender and executing the contracts and thereafter take a somersault through their
another organ by charging RVAT even on offshore and onshore goods despite observance of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74366714/ 10Assistant Commissioner vs M/S B.G.R. Energy Systems Ltd on 21 December, 2023
complete procedure prescribed in the contract by the assessee.
4.7. The seventh contention of the assessee is that RTB was correct in not imposing any penalty of
the petitioner in the present case as the issue involved is of pure question of interpretation of
provisions; as also since RVUNL, a State Government entity, is involved in the transactions. It
would be wrong to allege that there was any malafide on the part of the assessee as there is no
suppression by the assessee. Reliance is placed on The [2023:RJ-JP:23645] (18 of 45)
[STR-217/2020] Commissioner, Customs and Central Excise, Hyderabad IV vs. National Remote
Sensing Agency: 2021 [50] G.S.T.L. 465 and Alpha Associates vs. Deputy Commissioner of Income

SUBMISSIONS OF REVENUE
5. Learned Advocate General, Mr. M.S. Singhvi, appearing for the Revenue, made the following
submissions:
5.1. That all three contracts are single, composite, indivisible works contract taxable
under RVAT Act. The division of the contract into three was merely done for the
convenience of making payments. Learned AG has extensively highlighted various
clauses of the contract to submit that the same are composite and indivisible works
contract. Further, the RTB, which is the last fact-
finding authority, has also confirmed the contract to be a composite and indivisible one after
detailed examination of the contract in question in light of settled position of law and in view of
several Apex Court judgments. The findings of the RTB form para 7.11 to para 7.14, being infallible,
calls for no interference. 5.2. That as per terms and contract relating to works contract, complete
unit was required to be transferred to RVUNL. It is submitted that clauses of 'Final Handing Over',
'Project Schedule', 'Liquidated Damages', 'Warranty', 'Insurance' and 'Completion of Contract'
clearly reveal that under present works contract, the complete unit would be transferred to the
RVUNL by assessee and there is no individual handing over/supply of goods by assessee to RVUNL.
Further, as per the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 (for short "SOG Act"), the goods are said to be
transferred only [2023:RJ-JP:23645] (19 of 45) [STR-217/2020] when they are put to a deliverable
state by the contractor as per terms and conditions of contract and at that point the incidence of sale
took place for the purpose of works contract. Learned AG has also highlighted the finding of RTB at
para 9.10 and para 9.11 to submit that issuance of MDCC by RVUNL only confirmed the
specification of the goods to be used in the execution of the works contract. Mere issuance of MDCC,
by no conceivable means, can be said to be transfer of title or ownership, as the assessee was still
required to deliver the goods and put them in a deliverable state.
5.3. That the terms and conditions of contract are relevant for determination of the intention of the
parties. In the case in hand, RVUNL issued the single NIT for erection of the thermal power plant.
The sale in the present case is not of individual goods but is of the thermal power plant constructed
and installed by the assessee. It is submitted that in order to attract CST Act, the condition
precedent is that it should be sale in the course of inter- state trade or commerce. The goods which
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74366714/ 11Assistant Commissioner vs M/S B.G.R. Energy Systems Ltd on 21 December, 2023
were used in the installation of plant shall fall within the expression 'deemed to be sale of those
goods by the person executing works contract'. It is further submitted that installation of thermal
power plant and sale thereof in the state of Rajasthan cannot be termed as sale in the course of
inter-state trade or commerce. The erection of the plant can only be termed as an intra-state
transaction and hence property in goods used in such erection, whether as goods or in some other
form, would constitute an intra-state sale within the meaning of Article 366(29-A) of the
Constitution of India and [2023:RJ-JP:23645] (20 of 45) [STR-217/2020] accordingly will be
subject to RVAT Act. It is further submitted that in the present case, the goods claimed by the
assessee to be part of inter-state sale were not sold to the RVUNL as goods but utilized in erection of
thermal power plant. Hence, such transactions cannot fall within the definition of inter-state sales.
It is also contended that Article 286 of Constitution of India does not apply in the present case
because prior to completion and transfer of plant to RVUNL, any part incorporated in plant could
not become saleable commodity under the contract. The said fact makes the judgment of CDVAT vs.
ABB Ltd. (supra), relied upon by the assessee, distinguishable and inapplicable. Further, in support
of his contentions, learned AG has placed strong reliance on Gannon Dunkerley and Co. & Ors. vs.
State of Rajasthan and Ors.: (1993) 1 SCC 364, Hindustan Shipyard Ltd. vs. State of Andhra
Pradesh: (2000) 6 SCC 579, BSNL vs Union of India: (2006) 3 SCC 1, Larsen and Toubro Limited &
Ors. vs. State of Karnataka & Ors.: (2014) 1 SCC 708, Kone Elevator India Pvt. Ltd. vs. State of Tamil
Nadu & Ors.:
(2014) 7 SCC 1, State of U.P. & Ors. vs. P.N.C. Construction Co. Ltd. & Ors.: (2007) 7
SCC 320, and K. Raheja Development Corporation vs. State of Karnataka: (2005) 5
SCC 162.
5.4. That none of the judgments relied upon by the assessee deal with a single, composite, indivisible
EPC works contract wherein there is a transfer of complete plant and therefore none of those
judgments are applicable in the instant case.
[2023:RJ-JP:23645] (21 of 45) [STR-217/2020] 5.5. On the issue of setting aside of penalty by the
RTB, learned AG submitted that the assessee has wrongly exhibited the subject sales as inter-state
sales and clandestinely evaded the applicable taxes and by fabricating parallel and antedated
invoices. Learned AG has also taken this Court through the assessment order wherein several
discrepancies are pointed out, which have also been affirmed in para 8.11 of the RTB order. Learned
AG has highlighted about 137 invoices totaling about Rs. 785 crores, in which serious discrepancies
were found. Therefore, it is contended that the penalty was wrongly set aside by the RTB. Reliance is
placed on State of Gujarat and Ors. vs. Saw Pipes Ltd. (Neutral Citation: 2023/INSC/376): AIR
2023 SC 2113 and R.S. Joshi and Ors. vs. Ajit Mills Limited and Ors.:
(1977) 4 SCC 98.
5.6. That the directions issued by the RTB of remanding the matter back for afresh consideration
was beyond the scope of the pleadings and was never argued and therefore the said direction is
erroneous. Reliance in this regard is placed on Trojan and Co. Ltd. vs. N.N. Nagappa Chettiar: AIR
1953 SC 235 and Bharat Amratlal Kothari vs. Dosukhan Samadkhan Sindhi & Ors.:

5.7. Reliance is also placed on Xerox Modicorp Limited vs. State of Karnataka: (2005)
7 SCC 380, CCT Kerala vs. K.T.C. Automobiles: (2016) 4 SCC 82, and Arihant Udhyog

ANALYSIS [2023:RJ-JP:23645] (22 of 45) [STR-217/2020]
6. Heard the arguments advanced by learned counsels appearing for the respective sides, thoroughly
scanned record of present STRs, and carefully considered the judgments cited by the learned
counsels.
7. The contention of the Revenue is that the contract was split into three parts merely for the
convenience of payment and as such, it was a single, composite and indivisible works contract
taxable under the RVAT Act. On the other hand, the contention of the assessee is that even if it was a
composite and indivisible works contract, it would not alter the taxability of the goods involved in
execution of the works contract because the subject sales were inter-state sale not eligible to state
taxation. Before proceedings to the merits of the case, it is necessary to recapitulate the background
of the case.
The case brief, for the sake of brevity, is reproduced in a tabular format as below:

Assessment 1. The assessee has broken a composite and indivisible Order works
contract into three contracts to avoid payment of RVAT.
2. The sale of goods claimed by the assessee to be from Maharashtra, Gujarat, and
Tamil Nadu (i.e. inter-state sale) are intra-state sale and exemption claimed from
payment of VAT under Section 3(a) and 3(b) read with Section 6(2) of CST Act on
such sales is incorrect.
3. Penalty was imposed

Section 3(a) of CST Act.
2. Sale of on-shore goods by assessee from Chennai is First Appellate covered under
Section 3(b) of CST Act and exempted Order under Section 6(b) of CST Act and not
taxable.
3. Penalty was set aside.
1. Sale of off-shore and on-shore goods is intra-state sale as per Section 4(2) of CST Act on which
RVAT is leviable.
2. No penalty was imposed.
3. Matter remanded back to assessing officer with RTB Order direction pertaining to benefit of
notification dated 28.04.2006 for FY 2009-10 and rate of tax on goods of special importance.

9. As per the provisions of law quoted above, the State has power to levy sales tax/VAT on 'deemed
sale of goods' used in execution of works contract. In works contract, the assessee is liable to pay
service tax on service element and sales tax on goods transferred. The bone of contention is whether
the sale of goods involved in the present case were inter-state sales or intra-state sales. To ascertain
that, we must first determine the nature of the transaction. As per settled position of law, the terms
and conditions of the contract are relevant for determining the intention of parties. In this regard,
we may note the relevant extracts of some judgments on the issue.
9.1. In the case of Gannon Dunkerley (supra), the Apex Court observed as under:
"40. ...We do not propose to go into this controversy because the question whether a
deemed sale resulting from transfer of property in goods involved in the execution of
a particular works contract amounts to a sale in the course of inter-State
[2023:RJ-JP:23645] (28 of 45) [STR-217/2020] trade or commerce under Section 3
of the Central Sales Tax Act or an outside sale under Section 4 of the Central Sales
Tax Act or a sale in the course of import under Section 5 of the Central Sales Tax Act
has to be decided in the light of the particular terms of the work contract and it
cannot be decided in the abstract. As at present advised, we are not in a position to
say that in no case, can there be a sale in the course of inter-State trade or commerce
or an outside sale or a sale in the course of import in respect of a deemed sale
resulting from transfer of property in goods involved in the execution of a works
contract falling within the ambit of sub- clause (b) of clause (29-A) of Article 366 of
the Constitution."
9.2. In the case of Hindustan Shipyard (supra), the Apex Court observed as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74366714/ 17Assistant Commissioner vs M/S B.G.R. Energy Systems Ltd on 21 December, 2023
"6. ...No straitjacket formula can be made available nor can such quick-witted tests
devised as would be infallible. It is all a question of determining the intention of the
parties by culling out the same on an overall reading of the several terms and
conditions of a contract. In State of Gujarat (CST) v. Variety Body Builders: (1976) 3
SCC 500 this Court observed that there is no standard formula by which one can
distinguish a contract of sale from a contract for work and labour. There may be
many common features in both the contracts, some neutral in a particular contract,
and yet certain clinching terms in a given case may fortify a conclusion one way or
the other. It will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. The question
is not always easy and has for all times vexed jurists all over.
27. The recitals of the contract may also be read in the light of the few provisions of
Chapter III of the Sale of Goods Act. In a contract for the sale of specific or
ascertained goods the property in them is transferred to the buyer at such time as the
parties to the contract intend it to be transferred. Sections 20 to 24 contain rules for
ascertaining the intention of the parties in this regard. When something remains to
be done on the date of the contract to bring the specific goods in a
[2023:RJ-JP:23645] (29 of 45) [STR-217/2020] deliverable state the property does
not pass until such thing is done and brought to the notice of the buyer."
9.3. In the case of BSNL vs. UOI (supra), the Apex Court observed as under:
"The court would have to arrive at the conclusion as to what the parties had intended
when they entered into a particular transaction of sale, as being the subject-matter of
sale or purchase. In arriving at a conclusion the court would have to approach the
matter from the point of view of a reasonable person of average intelligence."
10. Therefore, to ascertain the nature of the contract, this Court is required to scrutinize the terms
and conditions mentioned therein. The contract is on record and the relevant terms of the contract
are also reproduced in the RTB Order dated 19.03.2020 from paras 7.4 to 7.10. However, for the
sake of convenience, and to avoid repetition, some of the relevant clauses of the contract are
reproduced as under:
"CROSS FALL BREACH (Contractor. Instructions To Bidder (ITB)- Clause 22
General Conditions of Contract (GCC)- Clause 31.1
1. All the three contracts will contain a cross fall breach clause specifying that breach
of one contract will constitute breach of the other.
2. Article 3.7 of all three contracts It is expressly agreed to by the EPC contractor that
notwithstanding the fact that the contract is termed as engineering procurement and
construction (EPC) contract or indicates the break-up of the contract consideration,
or awarded three contracts for convenience of operation. It is infact one composite

breach of the entire contract.
CONTRACT PRICE The total Contract price for the entire scope of this contract as
detailed in letter of intent is Rs. 4900.06 crores. This shall be firm till completion of

Income Tax, any cess thereof and any other similar tax etc, the RVUN shall not bear
any liability whatsoever, irrespective of the mode of contracting. The contractor shall
be liable and responsible for payment of all such taxes, if attracted under the
provisions of law. The Works Contract Tax and Income Tax will be deducted at
source on composite value (combined value of all the three contract as described
above) of turnkey EPC Contract. If the State or Central Govt. brings any other tax
deduction at source into effect, during the validity of the Contract then the same shall
be deducted at source as per the prevailing rules.
SCOPE OF WORK clause no. 5 of contract no. 3832, clause 11 of contract no. 3833
and clause 11 of contract 3834 having following conditions which are exactly similar
to each other and are as follows-

11. From a careful analysis of the terms and conditions of the contract(s) in light of the
aforementioned Apex Court judgments, the following points emerge:
(a) A unified bid was invited through a single NIT by RVUNL on EPC basis for
erection of the thermal power project, which included both supply of goods as well as
services.
[2023:RJ-JP:23645] (34 of 45) [STR-217/2020]
(b) Bidders had to quote their proposal in lump-sum for the entire scope of work.
(c) The bid was awarded to the assessee at approximately Rs. 4900.06 crores for the entirety of the
project.
(d) All three contracts contained a cross fall breach clause specifying that breach of one contract
would constitute breach of others, giving a right to the RVUNL to terminate the other contracts also
at the cost and risk of the contractor/assessee. This is quite enough to counter the contention of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74366714/ 21Assistant Commissioner vs M/S B.G.R. Energy Systems Ltd on 21 December, 2023
assessee that the three contracts were independent and separate.
(e) Award of three contracts could not and did not dilute the responsibility of the assessee to
successfully complete the erection of the thermal power project as per the specification on single
source responsibility basis.
(f) There was a provision in the contract itself about tax deduction at source (for short "TDS") and
accordingly TDS on Works Contract Tax was also deducted on composite value of the turnkey EPC
Contract.
(g) The letter dated 06.07.2009 also indicates that the goods were to be imported on CIF value for
use in erection of the power project.
(h) The separation of the contract into three parts was merely done for the convenience of payment
and notwithstanding the said break-up of contract, it was a composite and indivisible works contract
on a turnkey basis.
12. The relevant portion of the RTB order on this particular issue is reproduced as under:
[2023:RJ-JP:23645] (35 of 45) [STR-217/2020] "7.11 As evident from the
stipulations in Contract Documents a unified Bid was invited through a single NIT by
RVUN for Engineering, Procurement and Construction of coal based Kalisindh
Thermal Power Project (ITB-1). Scope of work included complete activities, services
and supply of goods (ITB-5, GCC-13.2). Bidders had to quote in their proposals
lumpsum price for the entire scope of work (ITB-18, GCC- 16.1). Provisions for TDS
of Works Contract Tax were there.
(ITB-18, GCC-16.2.7). All the supplies were acceptable ex- works and FOR site only (ITB-18,
GCC-13.2). Three contracts containing cross fall breach clause were to be executed with the
successful bidder (ITB-22, GCC-31.1). The contract performance Guarantee, Equipment
Performance Guarantee, Liquidated Damages etc. were to be calculated on the gross value of the
three contracts. (ITB-24, 25; GCC-22.1). "Plants and Equipment" were to mean permanent plant,
equipment, machinery and things of all kinds to be provided and incorporated under the contract
(GCC-3.44). "Works" were to mean and include furnishing of equipment, labour and services,
transport, handling, unloading and storage at site, Civil construction, erections, commissioning etc.
(GCC-3.57).
"Final take over" was to occur when all supplies and services were achieved.
(GCC-3.64). The bidder contractors were expected to be qualified and experienced in
the EPC of electric generating facilities (GCC-6-). Equipments not specifically
mentioned but required for satisfactory completion of the Project on turnkey basis
were also to be supplied (GCC-13.2,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74366714/ 22Assistant Commissioner vs M/S B.G.R. Energy Systems Ltd on 21 December, 2023
13.3). The contractor was responsible for taking insurance for all risks to equipment and material
upto final taking over (GCC-20). The contractor was obligated to undertake replacement of damaged
equipment free of cost. (GCC-20, 21, 21.2). Proportionate price of the contact was to be paid to the
contractor in case of termination of the contract prior to its completion (GCC-26.4). It was clearly
understood by the parties that the total consideration for the contract price was broken into various
components for the convenience of progressive payment only (CC-31.6). Progressive payments were
to be made on the basis of work executed at site and [2023:RJ-JP:23645] (36 of 45)
[STR-217/2020] equipments brought on to the site by the contractor (GCC- 45.4.2) 7.12 Before
clinching the issue we would like to have a view of what Hon'ble Supreme Court has said while
deciding the nature of a Turnkey Project or a Composite Contract -
11. By way of Letter of Award dated 16.08.1988, N.T.P.C awarded two contracts to the Company for
performing the work of erection of aforesaid plant on Turnkey Basis. Even though, two contracts
were entered into between the parties but in nutshell it was only one contract for the simple reason
that N.T.P.C kept a right with it with regard to cross fall breach clause meaning thereby that default
in one contract would tantamount to default in another and whole contract was liable to be
cancelled." Indure Ltd. Vs. CTO (2010) 9 SCC 461 (SC)
64. ........ It may be noted here that in all the cases that have been brought before us, there is a
composite contract for the purchase and installation of the lift. The price quoted is a composite one
for both...... But it is not in dispute that the preparatory work has to be done taking into
consideration as to how the lift is going to be attached to the building. The nature of the contracts
clearly exposit that they are contracts for supply and installation of the lift where labour and service
element is involved..... But, a pregnant one, once there is a composite contract for supply and
installation, it has to be treated as a works contract, for it is not a sale of goods/chattel simpliciter. It
is not chattel sold as chattel or, for that matter, a chattel being attached to another chattel...."Kone
Elevator India Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of Tamil Nadu (2014) 71 VST 1 (SC) 7.13 Out of the three subject
contracts, contract no. 3834 is seemingly admitted to be a Works Contract by the parties.
Construction of the foundations, bases etc. for the ensuing Power Plant with other related Civil
construction was within the scope of this contract. The parties already agreed to deduct Works
Contract Tax @2-25% of the payment made [2023:RJ-JP:23645] (37 of 45) [STR-217/2020] against
execution of this contract. This contract in isolation of the other two contracts is a works contract in
itself and the respondent has admitted and discharged the tax liability voluntarily on the goods
involved in execution of this contract. It is surprising on the part of the respondent that the initial
work (Construction of foundations civil work etc.) and the final work (erection and installation of
the materials supplied under contract no. 3832 & 3233) are in the perview of contract no. 3834 but
the work in between i.e. (procurement of plants and equipments) is not.
7.14 That the contracts were awarded to the respondent on EPC contract basis / Single Source
Responsibility basis / Turnkey basis (GCC-13.2 &opening of C-3832, 3833 & 3834). Looking to the
intention of the parties and stipulations in the contracts the contracts for supply and service had to
be awarded to the same party. Apart from the single NIT and unified BID, the ITB the GCC and the
SCC etc. were uniformly applicable to all the Contracts. The respondent company was awarded the
contract for it's expertise in erection and installation of Power Plants and not for its supplying,
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74366714/ 23Assistant Commissioner vs M/S B.G.R. Energy Systems Ltd on 21 December, 2023
transporting, loading, unloading skills of the goods. Evidently the intention of the parties was only
to execute work with material supplied by the respondent. Contractual clauses referred in the
forgoing paras are enough to demonstrate that the form of the contracts is indicative of three
separate contracts but in substance they are one indivisible works contract for supply of material
and erection and installation of equipments. They are so intertwined and interdependent that we are
unable to accept them as separate and independent contracts and unhesitatingly hold them an
indivisible Works Contract."
13. In the considered opinion of this Court, the RTB, after careful consideration of the entire record,
had rightly concluded the contract to be a composite and indivisible EPC works contract on turnkey
basis. The observation by the RTB reproduced above, [2023:RJ-JP:23645] (38 of 45)
[STR-217/2020] are in content and form, flawless and thus this Court has no hesitation in affirming
the view taken by RTB in this regard.
14. Now what remains to be seen is whether the subject sale of the goods were inter-state sales or
intra-state sales. The assessee contends that the off-shore sales were inter-state sales covered under
Section 3(a) of CST Act as the identified goods were supplied by the Gujarat and Maharashtra
branch of the assessee directly to RVUNL and the Rajasthan branch of the assessee merely acted as
a bailee. Similarly, the assessee contends that the sale of on-shore goods were also inter-state sales
covered under Section 3(b) read with Section 6(2) of CST Act. On the contrary, the Revenue
contends that the subject sales were 'deemed sale' under the works contract and liable to be taxed
under RVAT Act. To resolve this controversy, this Court must determine the nature of sale and when
the sale was effected. For this, recourse may be taken to SOG Act, the relevant provisions of which
are reproduced as under:
"Section 2 - Definitions (3) goods are said to be in a "deliverable state" when they are
in such state that the buyer would under the contract be bound to take delivery of
them;
(6) "future goods" means goods to be manufactured or produced or acquired by the
seller after the making of the contract of sale;
(14) "specific goods" means goods identified and agreed upon at the time a contract
of sale is made;
Section 4. Sale and agreement to sell (1) A contract of sale of goods is a contract
whereby the seller transfers or agrees to transfer the property in goods
[2023:RJ-JP:23645] (39 of 45) [STR-217/2020] to the buyer for a price. There may
be a contract of sale between one part-owner and another.
(2) A contract of sale may be absolute or conditional. (3) Where under a contract of
sale the property in the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer, the contract
is called a sale, but where the transfer of the property in the goods is to take place at a
future time or subject to some condition thereafter to be fulfilled, the contract is
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74366714/ 24Assistant Commissioner vs M/S B.G.R. Energy Systems Ltd on 21 December, 2023
called an agreement to sell. (4) An agreement to, sell becomes a sale when the time
elapses or the conditions are fulfilled subject to which the property in the goods is to
be transferred.
Section 19- Property passes when intended to pass (1) Where there is a contract for
the sale of specific or ascertained goods the property in them is transferred to the
buyer at such time as the parties to the contract intend it to he transferred.
(2) For the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the parties regard shall be had to
the terms of the contract, the conduct of the parties and the circumstances of the
case. (3) Unless a different intention appears, the rules contained in sections 20 to 24
are rules for ascertaining the intention of the parties as to the time at which the
property in the goods is to pass to the buyer.
Section 20. Specific goods in a deliverable state Where there is an unconditional contract for the sale
of specific goods in a deliverable state, the property in the goods passes to the buyer when the
contract is made, and it is immaterial whether the time of payment of the price or the time of
delivery of the goods, or both, is postponed. Section 21-Specific goods to be put into a deliverable
state Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods and the seller is bound to do something
to the goods for the purpose of putting them into a deliverable state, the property does not pass until
such thing is done and the buyer has notice thereof.
[2023:RJ-JP:23645] (40 of 45) [STR-217/2020] Section 22- Specific goods in a deliverable state,
when the seller has to do anything thereto in order to ascertain price Where there is a contract for
the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state, but the seller is bound to weigh, measure, test or do
some other act or thing with reference to the goods for the purpose of ascertaining the price, the
property does not pass until such act or thing is done and the buyer has notice thereof Section 26-
Risk prima facie passes with property Unless otherwise agreed, the goods remain at the seller's risk
until the property therein is transferred to the buyer, but when the property therein is transferred to
the buyer, the goods are at the buyer's risk whether delivery has been made or not: Provided that,
where delivery has been delayed through the fault of either buyer or seller, the goods are at the risk
of the party in fault as regards any loss which might not have occurred but for such fault:
Provided also that nothing in this section shall affect the duties or liabilities of either
seller or buyer as a bailee of the goods of the other party."
15. As already discussed above, the contract was a composite and indivisible EPC works contract. In
the simplest of terms, RVUNL was to receive the final thermal power project which was to be
erected by the assessee for which the assessee was to receive a fixed consideration. It is not a case
where there was sale of individual goods to the RVUNL. Though the goods were specially designed
to be used in the power project, the point of transfer of such goods is what is relevant for
determining whether the title to the goods transferred to RVUNL during movement of goods from
one state to another. The assessee contends that the title to the goods transferred to the assessee
outside the State of [2023:RJ-JP:23645] (41 of 45) [STR-217/2020] Rajasthan, upon issuance of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74366714/ 25Assistant Commissioner vs M/S B.G.R. Energy Systems Ltd on 21 December, 2023
MDCC or other like documents. However, the issuance of MDCC is not determinative of transfer of
title. MDCC merely identifies the specification of the goods to be used in the execution of works
contract. The liability to transport these goods and the risk involved therein was with the assessee.
Further, the assessee was required to transfer the power project in operational state. In the case in
hand, the pre-dispatch inspection and issuance of MDCC, in view of terms of contract, did not serve
the purpose of transfer of goods. This unequivocally establishes that there was no transfer of title of
goods after their inspection and/or issuance of MDCC or any like document.
16. The intent of the parties is quite clear. The clauses of 'Final Handing Over', 'Project Schedule',
'Liquidated Damages', 'Warranty', 'Insurance', 'Completion of Contract', the project import
certificate letter dated 06.07.2009, etc. clearly reveal that under the present works contract, the
complete unit/power project would be transferred by assessee to RVUNL. Further, as per SOG Act,
the goods are said to be transferred only when they are put into deliverable state by the contractor as
per the terms and conditions of contract. The transfer in the case was of entire thermal power
project. The title to the goods involved in the execution of works contract also, accordingly, only
transferred to RVUNL upon completion of contract and upon final handing over of the project as the
goods had been subjected to some process to be accommodated in the power project. The same is
also evident by the project import certification letter dated 06.07.2009. In the present case, the
goods claimed to be sold by the assessee to be [2023:RJ-JP:23645] (42 of 45) [STR-217/2020] part
of inter-state sales were not sold to the RVUNL as goods, but utilized in erection of the thermal
power project. Since the erection of thermal power project in the state of Rajasthan can only be
termed as an intra-state transaction, the property in goods used in such erection, whether as goods
or as some other form, would constitute an intra-state sale and accordingly be subject to RVAT.
Therefore, this Court is in agreement with the finding rendered by the RTB in para 11.3, which is
reproduced as under:
"11.3. It is obvious from the provisions of S.4(2) of CST Act that a sale shall be
deemed to take place inside a State, if the goods are within the State at the time the
contract of sale is made (in case of specific or ascertained goods) or at the time of
their appropriation to the contract of sale (in case of future or unascertained goods).
As has been already discussed in detail the goods involved in the case have been
future goods. Their unconditional appropriation to the contract of sale took place
only in Rajasthan. Thus, we hold the transaction of offshore and onshore goods
claimed under Section 3(a) and Section 3(b) (of CST Act) respectively as sales within
Rajasthan taxable under the RVAT Act, 2003."
17. The assessee has relied on several judgments, however none of those judgment deals with EPC
works contract where there is a transfer of entire project. The judgment of CDVAT vs. ABB Ltd.
(supra), being on different facts, has rightly been distinguished by the RTB with sufficient reasons
and it is not deemed necessary to reproduce those reasons here again. Further, the judgment of
Indure Ltd. vs. CTO (supra), on which heavy reliance was placed by the assessee, pertains to Section
5(2) of CST Act, whereas the assessee is claiming applicability of CST on [2023:RJ-JP:23645] (43 of
45) [STR-217/2020] the basis of Section 3 read with Section 6(2) of CST Act. Even otherwise, the
nature of transactions is different and the revenue in that case was not allowed to belatedly raise the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74366714/ 26Assistant Commissioner vs M/S B.G.R. Energy Systems Ltd on 21 December, 2023
plea that imported goods were subjected to manufacturing process as part of execution of works
contract, whereas in the present case this has been one of the primary arguments of the Revenue.
18. So far as the contention of the assessee that CST along with Entry Tax has already been paid on
subject sales is concerned, it is trite that when a statute requires something to be done in certain
way, it has to, necessarily, be done in that way. Reliance is placed on Selvi J.Jayalalithaa & Ors vs
State Of Karnataka & Ors: (2014) 2 SCC 401. Since the nature of transaction attracts applicability of
RVAT Act, the assessee cannot be absolved of his liability to pay the same merely because the parties
had agreed to pay different tax. There is no estoppel against law. Merely because the assessee might
have wrongly paid tax under a different statute would not absolve the assessee from liability to pay
tax where it is actually due. The issuance of C-Form under CST Act or Form VAT-47 under RVAT
Rules have no bearing on nature of transaction. There was a clause in the contract which specified
that TDS on works contract would be deducted under the RVAT Act and the same was done at the
end of assessee. Further, as rightly observed by the Karnataka High Court in Cotmac Pvt. Ltd. vs.
CTO: (1967) 20 STC 20 (Kar.), it is not possible to adjust the tax refundable under one Act against
tax due under another Act.
[2023:RJ-JP:23645] (44 of 45) [STR-217/2020]
19. In view of the above, no interference is called for in the STR Nos. 217-219/2020, preferred by the
assessee.
20. In the STR Nos. 155-157/2020, preferred by the Revenue, challenge is made to the impugned
direction of remand along with setting aside of penalty. So far as penalty is concerned, this Court is
of the considered opinion that the lis in question was purely a question of interpretation of statutes.
Furthermore, there are disturbed finding by the authorities below and one of the parties to the
transaction was an extended arm of the State. In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that
the RTB had rightly set aside the penalty and this Court is not inclined to interfere with the same.
21. However, so far as the directions of remand are concerned, considering that the same was
beyond the scope of pleading; that no issue in this regard were framed before the RTB or before the
lower adjudicating authorities; that the same was not even a relief claimed by the assessee, and that
no arguments were made to this effect, this Court is inclined to set aside the direction of remand,
considering the Apex Court judgments of Akella Lalitha vs. Konda Hanumantha Rao and Ors.: AIR
2022 SC 3544, Trojan & Co. (supra), and Bharat Amratlal Kothari (supra).
RESULT
22. In view of the foregoing analysis, the questions of law framed in STR Nos. 217-219/2020
(preferred by the assessee), are answered in favour of the Revenue and against the assessee.
[2023:RJ-JP:23645] (45 of 45) [STR-217/2020]
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/74366714/ 27Assistant Commissioner vs M/S B.G.R. Energy Systems Ltd on 21 December, 2023
23. The question of law nos. 1-3 in STR Nos. 155-157/2020 (preferred by revenue) are answered in
favour of Revenue and against the assessee and conversely question of law no. 4 in STR Nos.
155-157/2020 qua penalty is answered in favour of assessee and against the Revenue.
24. Resultantly, the order of RTB is modified to the extent of setting aside of remand directions. The
rest of the order of RTB is maintained.
25. Accordingly, all these STRs, along with pending application(s), if any, stands disposed of in
above terms.
