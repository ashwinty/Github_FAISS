JUDGMENT
Rakesh Tiwari, J.
1. Invoking extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution, this
petition takes an exception to the Judgment and decree dated 21.8.2003 in S.C.C. Suit No. 1 of 1998
passed by Civil Judge (Senior Division), Small Causes Court, Banda affirmed in S.C.C. Revision No.
15 of 2003 by judgment and order dated 29.4.2005 passed by Special Judge, (S.C./S.T. Act), Small
Causes Court, Banda appended as Annexures-6 and 7 respectively to the writ petition.
2. Concise facts are as under:
Respondent-landlord filed S.C.C. Suit No. 1 of 1998 against the tenant-petitioner,
inter alia, on the ground that the shop, in question, was constructed in 1990. Rent of
the shop in May, 1997 was Rs. 535.50 P. per month. He further claimed that shop No.
7 was constructed in 1987 and the shop in dispute as well as the entire building was
assessed for the first time on 17.11.1992 which became effective from April, 1993. The
landlord demanded rent from May, 1997 from him by means of notice dated
7.10.1997 and when the petitioner failed to pay the rent from May, 1997, landlord
instituted aforesaid suit.
3. The petitioner-tenant contested the suit by filing written statement denying the plaint allegations,
pleading that since the shop, in question was constructed in 1990 and provisions of U.P. Urban
Buildings (Regulation of Lettings, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act')
were not applicable.
4. She set up a case that actual rent of the disputed shop was Rs. 510.30 P and not Rs. 535.50 P as
claimed by the landlord and that the rent from May to June, 1997 was tendered by her through
Money Order Receipt No. 1386 dated 7.10.1997 to the landlord which was refused. It was also
alleged that rent from May, 1997 to July, 1997 was again tendered to the landlord through M.O.
Receipt No. 1229 dated 16.10.1997 which too was refused by him.

5. She further claimed that disputed shop was constructed in 1984 and it was for the first time
assessed w.e.f. 1.4.1985. She also stated that she had deposited entire arrears of rent together with
interest and cost of the suit on the first date of hearing.
6. It was also pleaded by her that a sum of Rs. 10,000 was received by the landlord as a security
money and had promised to return the same when the shop will be vacated and that amount of Rs.
10,000 was never returned by the landlord, therefore, he was not entitled to determine the tenancy
of the petitioner ; that disputed shop was taken on rent by her in 1986 and agreement of tenancy
was required to be submitted in 1991 to obtain licence for sale of medicines, therefore, after
depositing a sum of Rs. 10,000 with the landlord an agreement dated 23.4.1991 was obtained. She
alleged that her tenancy under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act was not determined as
alleged by the landlord.
7. Subsequently, plaint was amended and the tenant-petitioner filed additional written statement,
appended as Annexure-3 to the writ petition. The landlord also filed replication after amendment of
written statement by tenant, appended as Annexure-4 to the writ petition. In paragraph 4 of the
replication, landlord has admitted receipt of Rs. 10,000 as security money on 1.5.1991.
8. On the basis of pleading of the parties, following issues were framed by Judge Small Causes
Court:
(i) Whether the provisions of U.P. Act No. 13 of 1972 were applicable to the disputed
shop?
(ii) Whether the rate of rent from May, 1997 is Rs. 535.15 per month?
(iii) Whether the tenancy has not come to an end for want of return of Rs. 10,000
allegedly deposited by tenant with the plaintiff?
(iv) Whether the defendant is entitled to the benefit of Section 20(4) of U.P. Act No.
13 of 1972?
9. The suit was dismissed by the Judge, Small Causes Court vide judgment and order dated 9.1.2001
against which the respondent preferred Revision No. 10 of 2001, Hari Mohan Gupta v. Smt. Kiran
Agrawal, which was remanded back to Judge Small Causes Court by order dated 27.11.2001
specifically directing to record a finding on issue Nos. 1 to 4 and to consider paper No. 80C.
10. The suit was thereafter decreed vide impugned judgment and decree dated 21.8.2003.
11. Aggrieved by judgment and decree dated 21.8.2003, the tenant preferred S.C.C. Revision No. 15
of 2003, which has also been dismissed by the impugned judgment and order dated 29.4.2005
which has been challenged in the instant writ petition.
Contentions of counsel for the petitioner
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1090606/ 2Kiran Agrawal vs Hari Mohan Gupta on 21 September, 2006
12. On issue No. 1 as to whether the provisions of the Act were applicable, counsel for the petitioner
contended that the tenant filed certified copy of letter of intimation of completion of construction by
the landlord in December, 1983 to the Executive Officer Nagar Palika, Banda wherein the landlord
informed Nagar Palika Banda that 4 shops and residential house have already been constructed
towards north of Banda Hospital Gate and that there is an endorsement on the said letter informing
that three shops and one room over the shops have already been constructed. Report dated 5.1.1984
and order dated 7.1.1984 of Executive Officer is also endorsed thereon. This document being a
public document within the meaning of Sections 74(2) and 77 of the Evidence Act, they may be
produced in proof of the contents of public documents are part of public document of which they
purport to be copies.
13. He urged that the landlord made a bald denial and stated that he never filed such application.
Such bald denial was not sufficient. Burden was on him to rebut the statutory presumption.
14. He submitted that the landlord examined P.W. 3 Sri Anil Kumar and P.W. 4 Sri Krishna Gopal
who are employees of Nagar Palika Banda but in their examination no question was asked from
them regarding genuineness of the certified copy of paper No. 80C. He further submits that the
Judge Small Causes Court committed manifest error of law by shifting burden of proof to obtain
paper No. 80C on the tenant and recorded a perverse finding that it cannot be believed that paper
No. 80C was moved by the landlord. The trial court also refused to rely on the statement of P.W. 1
specifically admitting that the disputed shop was constructed in 1984 and was assessed for the first
time in 1988.
15. He urged that Explanation 1 of Section 2(2) of the Act provides that construction of building
shall be deemed to have been completed on the date on which the completion thereof is reported to
or otherwise recorded by the Local Authority having jurisdiction. It further provides that if dates are
different then the construction of the building shall be deemed to have been completed on the
earliest of the said dates.
16. The counsel for the petitioner states that the trial court further proceeded to consider paper Nos.
39Ka which was zerox copy and other documents, such a paper No. 40Ga, 79Ga and 98Ga and
recorded a perverse finding that the shop was constructed after 1985. He assailed the judgment of
the appellate court on the aforesaid issue on the ground that merely after considering the certified
copy of intimation of completion of construction by the landlord to the Executive Officer, Nagar
Palika, Banda, the appellate court affirmed the finding of the trial court. Thus, he urged, that both
the courts below committed apparent error of law in deciding issue No. 1 on the basis of perverse
finding holding that provisions of the Act were not applicable as the disputed shop was constructed
after 1985.
It is submitted that both the courts below have also failed to consider the legal position that burden
of proof regarding construction of building is on the landlord. In support of his contention, the
counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance upon the decision in Ram Swaroop Rai v. Smt. Lilawati
1980 ARC 466 and Vijay Laxmi Jain v. Rameshwar Dayal Gupta 2001 (1) ARC 514 : 2001 (2) AWC
881, wherein it has been held that the provisions of Act applies to all buildings save where the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1090606/ 3Kiran Agrawal vs Hari Mohan Gupta on 21 September, 2006
exemption operates. Therefore, the landlord who seeks exemption must prove that exemption. The
burden is on him to make out that notwithstanding the rent control legislation, his building is out of
its ambit. It is not for the tenant to prove that the building has been constructed beyond a period of
ten years, but is for the landlord/landlady to make out that the construction has been completed
within 10 years of the suit.
17. On issue No. 2 as to whether rent from May, 1997 is Rs. 535.15 per month, he urged that
according to the pleading of the landlord, the tenancy commenced from May, 1991. According to the
terms of the agreement the tenancy commenced @ Rs. 400 per month and rent was to be increased
by 5% every yea. The tenant denied such increase. The landlord also filed written agreement in the
shape of paper No. 34Ka and in the said agreement, there is no mention regarding alleged 5%
increase of rent after every year. The trial court though recorded finding that there is no mention of
alleged increase of rent in paper No. 34Ka, but only on the basis of receipt showing increase of rent
passed the impugned judgment in favour of the landlord.
18. He submitted that in his deposition, the tenant stated that rent was increased on the basis of oral
agreement but she had refused to enhance the rent as far back as in 1997 as there was no such oral
agreement as alleged and rent remained Rs. 510.30P. It is stated that the finding to the contrary by
both the courts below are baseless and based on surmises and conjectures. They cannot be sustained
in law.
19. On issue No. 3 as to whether for non-refund of security amount of Rs. 10,000 by the landlord to
the tenant, the tenancy stood determined, the counsel for the petitioner contended that the landlord
received a sum of Rs. 10,000 from the tenant on 23.4.1991 in contravention of Section 4 of the Act
which prohibits the landlord to take or receive from the tenant any premium of additional payment
over and above the rent and, therefore, acceptance of Rs. 10,000 as security money was illegal. In
support of this contention, he placed reliance upon the decision of Hon'ble Apex Court in Model
Hotel. Gudur v. K. Radha Krishnaniah and Anr. 1989 (2) ARC 202, wherein it has been held that
such stipulation to refund excess amount after the expiry of lease is null and void and such amount
in possession of the landlord was an amount held by him on account of the tenancy on the date of
filing of the petition for eviction. It was further held that in such a case, the tenant cannot be evicted
on the ground of default.
20. On issue No. 4 as to whether the tenant is entitled to benefit of Section 20(4) of the Act, he urged
that S.C.C. Suit No. 1 of 1998 was filed on 6.1.1998 and the first date of hearing for which summons
were issued by the Court was 26.3.1998. It is stated that the tenant in paragraph 28 of the writ
petition has stated that he had deposited the entire amount of Rs. 7,799, as claimed by the landlord
on 26.3.1998 by tender appended as Annexure-16 to the writ petition, which has been admitted by
the landlord in paragraph 28 of the writ petition. It is urged that as the petitioner has specifically
pleaded in paragraph 18 of her written statement that she has deposited the entire amount as
required under Section 20(4) of the Act on the first date of hearing, in this view of the matter, the
finding of the trial court that tenant is not entitled to benefit of Section 20(4) of the Act as the
provisions of Act do not apply to the instant case, is perverse.

21. It is also further urged that the landlord had reported to the Nagar Palika Banda about
completion of disputed building in 1983 which is established by paper No. 80C. Thus, the provisions
of the Act are applicable to the present case and the petitioner is entitled to the benefit of Section
20(4) of the Act. Even if it is held that the provisions of the Act are not applicable to the present case
in that event also the petitioner is entitled to the benefit of Section 114 of the Transfer of Property
Act and order of eviction passed against the petitioner cannot be sustained.
22. In this regard, it is submitted that according to the landlord, the tenancy was determined by
notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act as the tenant failed to pay rent at the
enhanced rate of rent and sent rent through money order at the old rate of rent. From notice under
Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, it is evident that provisions of Section 114 of the
Transfer of Property Act were fully applicable even if provisions of the Act are not applicable to the
present case. He urged that Section 114 of the Transfer of Property Act provides that where a lease of
a immovable property has been determined by forfeiture for non-payment of rent and the lessor
sues to eject the lessee, if, at the hearing of the suit the lessee pays or tenders to the lessor the rent,
in arrear together with interest thereon and full cost of the suit, the Court will relieve the tenant
from decree of eviction. He contended that a perusal of notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of
Property Act makes it clear that tenancy has been determined since the tenant failed to pay the
enhanced rent and sent the rent through money order from May to July, 1997 at the old rate of rent.
Admittedly the landlord himself titled the lease deed dated 31.5.1991 as 'Qabuliatnama'. He
vehemently urged that in the instant case, the lease was determined for non-payment of rent at the
enhanced rate and there was an express condition in the lease deed to pay rent at the rate of Rs. 400
per month, hence the petitioner is certainly entitled to benefit of Section 20(4) of the Act and if it is
held that provisions of Act do not apply to the present case, then the petitioner is entitled to Section
114 of the Transfer of Property Act.
He referred to the written submission submitted by counsel for the respondents wherein he has
admitted that there was a written lease deed paper No. 34 Ga with regard to the applicability of
Section 114 of Transfer of Property Act and there is a express condition in the lease deed that the
lease will be forfeited if the rent is not paid and thus, Section 114 is not applicable to the case. He
urged that the submission of counsel for the respondent is misconceived and the decisions relied
upon by him are also not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the instant case as there was
an agreement, in writing, which is contained in Annexures-C.A. 7 to the counter affidavit. He urged
that since lease had been determined by notice dated 7.10.1997 under Section 106 of the Transfer of
Property Act on the ground of nonpayment of enhanced rent whereas the tenant had admittedly
paid the rent at the old rate, provisions of Section 114 of the Transfer of Property Act are fully
applicable. He vehemently urged that in the instant case, the lease was determined for non-payment
of rent at the enhanced rate and there was an express condition in the lease deed to pay rent at the
rate of Rs. 400 per month, hence the petitioner is certainly entitled to benefit of Section 20(4) of the
Act and if it is held that provisions of Act do not apply to the present case, then the petitioner is
entitled to Section 114 of the Transfer of Property Act.
23. He referred to the written statement submitted by counsel for the respondents wherein he has
admitted that there was a written lease deed paper No. 34Ga with regard to the applicability of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1090606/ 5Kiran Agrawal vs Hari Mohan Gupta on 21 September, 2006
Section 114 of Transfer of Property Act and there is a express condition in the lease deed that the
lease will be forfeited if the rent is not paid and thus, Section 114 is not applicable to the case. He
urged that the submission of counsel for the respondent is misconceived and the decisions relied
upon by him are also not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the instance case as there was
an agreement, in writing, which is contained in Annexure-C.A. 7 to the counter-affidavit. He urged
that since lease had been determined by notice dated 7.10.1997 under Section 106 of the Transfer of
Property Act on the ground of nonpayment of enhanced rent whereas the tenant had admittedly
paid the rent at the old rate, provisions of Section 114 of the Transfer of Property Act are fully
applicable.
24. Placing reliance on a decision of this Court in Azgar Ali v. Razzaq Hussain and Ors. 2004 (1)
AWC 505, wherein it has been held that it is not necessary to plead Section 114 of the Transfer of
Property Act specifically in case necessary plea of Section 20(4) of the Act are taken and the Court
comes to the conclusion that provisions of Act are not applicable, in such case, the Court must
record a finding regarding applicability of Section 114 of the Transfer of Property Act, he urged that
the impugned orders are in teeth of law laid down by higher Courts of land. In this behalf, he also
referred the decisions in Sujit Singh v. A.D.J. Hardwar and Ors. 1993 (22) ALR 482 and R.S. Lola
Praduman Kumar v. Virendra Goel .
25. He lastly urged that since the courts below have not recorded any finding on the question of
applicability of the provisions of Transfer of Property Act, in view of law laid down by Hon'ble the
Apex Court in Ranjit Singh v. Ravi Prakash and Surya Deo Rai v. Ram Chander Rai , the impugned
orders as unsustainable in the eyes of law and they are liable to be quashed.
Contentions of counsel for the respondent
26. Per contra, it has been contended by counsel for the respondent-landlord that the disputed shop
was constructed in July, 1990 as a separate accommodation and on the north and south of the
disputed shop, there were two other separate shops of the landlord. The whole building, including
the disputed shop was first assessed for municipal taxes w.e.f. April, 1993 by order of Nagar Pallka,
Banda dated 17.11.1992 and, thus, the building is outside the purview of the provisions of the Act.
27. It is submitted that the tenant occupied the disputed accommodation in May, 1991 at an agreed
rent of Rs. 400/- per month with the condition that the rent would be enhanced every year by 5%
and though the tenant continued to pay rent up to April. 1997 @ Rs. 510.30P per month with annual
increase but despite repeated demands, she failed to pay rent @ Rs. 535.50P per month from May,
1997 hence the landlord was compelled to serve a notice dated 7.10.1997 upon the tenant
terminating her tenancy and demanding arrears of rent w.e.f. May, 1997 @ Rs. 535.50P per month.
28. It is vehemently urged by the counsel for the respondent that it has been proved by municipal
assessment registers (paper Nos. 98Ga and 79Ga) in the courts below that the disputed shop was
first assessed in the Municipal register in 1986-87 hence according to him the disputed shop is
exempted from the operation of the Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1090606/ 6Kiran Agrawal vs Hari Mohan Gupta on 21 September, 2006
Conclusions:
29. Having heard the arguments advanced by counsels for rival parties and having gone through the
records, it is apparent from perusal of paper Nos. 98Ga and 79Ga that the entire building of the
landlord, including the disputed shop, was assessed by the Nagar Palika, Banda for the first time in
1986-87. In view of Explanation 1 to Section 2(1) of the Act, construction of the disputed shop would
be deemed to have completed in 1986. It is further urged that in view of decision rendered by
Hon'ble the Apex Court in Brahma Devi (Smt.) and Ors. v. Kali Charan Gupta and Ors. 2005 (3)
ARC 253, the building, in question, having been constructed after 26.4.1985 would be exempt from
operation of the Act for a period of 40 years.
30. From the facts of the case in hand, it is evident that the courts below have categorically recorded
a finding of fact that the provisions of the Act do not apply to the disputed shop. Moreover, the
tenant has candidly admitted in 'Kabuliyatnama' that the disputed shop was constructed in July,
1990 and that the provisions of the Act do not apply to the shop, in question. This admission of the
tenant has a binding effect as has been held in Ashok Gupta v. Anand Prakash Garg 1992 (2) ARC
977 : 1992 (3) AWC 1347. In Smt. Prakash Rani alias Prakashwati v. VIth A.D.J., Bulandshahr 2006
(2) ARC 296, wherein it has been held that when provisions of Act do not apply after termination of
tenancy, the tenant can be evicted and for such eviction, no default on the part of the tenant need be
proved in suit.
31. In so far as contention of counsel for the petitioner that the revisional court failed to consider
effect of paper No. 18Ga is concerned, a perusal of the said paper reveals that it is a certified copy of
notice purported to have been given by the landlord to the Municipal Board informing about
completion of building in 1983. The landlord in his evidence has challenged the validity of the said
notice as original of paper No. 80Ga was neither summoned nor produced before the courts below.
Even the Clerks of the Municipal Board, who were examined, also could not prove paper No. 80Ga
in absence of original. However, from a bare perusal of records, it is evident that the landlord clearly
proved that the building maps were sanctioned in 1984 and hence in this view of the matter, there
remains no occasion for the landlord to have informed about completion of building in 1983 itself.
32. It is also apparent on the face of record that execution of 'Kabooliyatnama' was not only proved
by landlord but even the tenant admitted its execution in paragraph 21A of the written statement.
33. From the order of the Judge, Small Causes Court it is evident that it has decided all the aforesaid
issues specifically after appraisal of oral and documentary evidence and has recorded findings of fact
in favour of the landlord. The relevant portion of the judgment and decree of the trial court is as
under:

34. The contention of counsel for the petitioner that tenant was entitled to protection of Section 114
of the Transfer of Property Act has no force as Section 114 of Transfer of Property Act does not apply
to the facts and circumstances of the instant case. Section 114 of Transfer of Property Act applies on
the fulfilment of three conditions : (1) there is a written agreement of lease between the parties (2)
there is an express condition in the lease deed that the lease will be forfeited if rent is not paid to the
lessor in accordance with the terms of the lease and (3) the lease is forfeited by the lessor on the
ground that the lessee has not complied with the terms of payment of rent as contained in the lease
deed as has been held in Yashpal v. Allahtala Malik Waqf Azakhan and Ors. 2005 (3) ARC 764 ;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1090606/ 9Kiran Agrawal vs Hari Mohan Gupta on 21 September, 2006
Arun Kumar v. VIIIth A.D.J., Badaun 2002 (20) LCD 822 : 2002 (2) AWC 1655. In Bhupendra
Singh v. A.D.J. Dehradun 1994 (2) ARC 472. In these cases, it has been held that where there is no
written or express agreement for forfeiture, provisions of Section 114 of the Transfer of Property Act
do not apply. Likewise, in Ram Bali Pandey v. IInd A.D.J., Kanpur 1998 (2) ARC 362 : 1999 (1) AWC
413 and Mohd. Nasir v. District Judge Nainital and Ors. 1999 (1) AWC 550, it has been held that
where tenancy is not forfeited for nonpayment of rent under the terms of the agreement but is
terminated under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, provisions of Section 114 of the
Transfer of Property Act will not apply.
35. The case laws cited by the counsel for the petitioner are not applicable to the facts and
circumstances of the instant case as in those cases, decisions have been rendered on different facts,
which are altogether distinguishable from the facts and circumstances of the case in hand.
36. In the present case, there was no lease deed providing an express agreement for forfeiture for
nonpayment of rent and the 'Kabuliyatnama' is a unilateral declaration which does not fall within
the category of a lease agreement.
37. From perusal of records, particularly notice dated 7.10.1997, it is evident that the tenancy of the
petitioner was terminated under Section 106 of Transfer of Property Act. Moreover, the
tenant-petitioner never pleaded before the courts below that she was entitled to the benefit of
Section 114 of the Transfer of Property Act hence she is estopped from raising such plea, for the first
time, in writ jurisdiction before this Court as it is not a pure question of law but a mixed question of
facts and law which requires to be proved by evidence also.
38. For the reasons stated above, the writ petition fails and is dismissed. Tenant-petitioner will
handover peaceful possession of the disputed shop to the respondent-landlord within a month from
today and make payment of arrears of rent, if any, within two months from today. In case the
disputed shop is not vacated and payment of arrears of rent is not made within the aforesaid
stipulated period, she will be evicted by assistance of Police and arrears of rent will be recovered as
arrears of land revenue.
Cost:
39. In so far as cost is concerned, Hon'ble the Apex Court in Salem Advocate Bar Association, Tamil
Nadu v. Union of India AIR 2005 SC 3353 : 2005 (3) AWC 2996 (SC), has held that:
So far as awarding of costs at the time of judgment is concerned, awarding of costs
must be treated generally as mandatory inasmuch as the liberal attitude of the Courts
in directing the parties to bear their own costs had led the parties to file a number of
frivolous cases in the Courts or to raise frivolous and unnecessary issues. Costs
should invariably follow the event. Where a party succeeds ultimately on one issue or
point but loses on number of other issues or points, which were unnecessarily raised.
Costs must be appropriately apportioned. Special reasons must be assigned if costs
are not being awarded. Costs should be assessed according to rule in force. If any of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1090606/ 10Kiran Agrawal vs Hari Mohan Gupta on 21 September, 2006
the parties has unreasonably protracted the proceedings, the Judge should consider
exercising discretion to impose exemplary costs after taking into account the expense
incurred for the purpose of attendance on the adjourned dates.
40. Thus from the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the aforesaid case of Salem Advocate
Bar Association (supra) it is apparent that non-payment of cost is an exception for which special
reasons have to be given by the Court and that in normal circumstances cost has to be awarded on
the party according to the issue decided in favour of the party which was unnecessarily raised. The
cost so imposed should be in accordance with rules and if the proceedings are unnecessarily
protracted or adjournments have been sought it is upon the discretion of the Judge to impose
exemplary cost taking also into account the circumstances etc. for the purpose of adjournment.
41. Following the ratio laid down in Salem Advocate Bar Association (supra), this Court in Civil
Misc. Writ Petition No. 48752 of 2006, Nizamuddin v. Shakoor Ahmad, after considering provisions
of Rule 9 of Chapter XXII and Rule 11 of Chapter XXI of the High Court Rules, 1951 and provisions
of Sections 34, 35A and 35B of the Code of Civil Procedure has held that while awarding interest on
a party by non-payment of principal amount or any dues should also be considered by the Court and
not only interest but penal interest may also be awarded.
42. Since it is a frivolous petition, the cost is to be deterrent and exemplary. In the facts and
circumstances of the case, it is directed that apart from payment of arrears of rent, the petitioner
will also pay cost of Rs. 10,000 which shall be deposited by her before the District Judge, Banda
within two months from today. The arrears of rent as well as the cost so deposited can be withdrawn
by the respondent-landlord without furnishing any security within two months from the date of
deposit. In case the petitioner fails to make payment of the aforesaid amount, the same shall be
recoverable as arrears of land revenue.
