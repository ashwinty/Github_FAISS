Prefactory Facts
1. This writ petition raises a very interesting question, which is, when does registration of a
document take effect? The documents in issue in the instant case are two separate lease deeds of
even date i.e., 9.10.2013. They were presented for registration before the concerned Sub Registrar
on 10.10.2013, while the certificate of registration under Section 60 of the Registration Act, 1908 (in
short "1908 Act") was issued on 14.10.2013.

2. The petitioner, inter alia, places reliance on Section 75 (3) of the 1908 Act to contend that the
registration of the aforementioned lease deeds would take effect when they were first duly presented
for registration before the concerned Sub Registrar, i.e., on 10.10.2013 whereas the first respondent,
i.e., Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. (in short "IOCL") contends that since certificate of registration
under Section 61 of the very same Act was issued on 14.10.2013, the registration stood completed
only on that date.
3. The petitioner has also adverted to Section 47 of the 1908 Act to contend that the registration
relates back to the date when the concerned document was first executed. The reason IOCL takes a
contra stand is that the petitioner who was otherwise intimated that his candidature for
appointment as a distributor for LPG gas had been accepted, was informed subsequently via
communication dated 2.2.2015 that his candidature had been rejected, and the amount of
Rs.50,000/- deposited by him stood forfeited in accordance with clause 11 (h) of the advertisement
issued by it.
4. As is obvious, the petitioner, on the other hand, has taken a stand that the date given on the lease
deeds and the date of presentation was important, (both of which were prior to the last date fixed for
submissions of applications which was 10.10.2013) and not the date when the certificate of
registration was issued.
5. The controversy in the present case, as alluded to at the outset, revolves around this piquant issue.
Thus, in order to adjudicate upon W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 2 the instant petition, the following broad
facts are required to be noticed: -
6. IOCL along with other oil marketing companies such as Bharat Petroleum Pvt. Ltd. (for short
"BPCL") and Hindustan Petroleum Pvt. Ltd. (for short "HPCL") had issued a common
advertisement in two newspapers having English and Hindi editions, calling for applications for
appointment as LPG distributors under various categories across National Capital Territory of
Delhi. As per clause 9 of the said advertisement, the applications had to be filed before the closing of
office on 10.10.2013.
7. The petitioner in pursuance of the aforementioned advertisement had obtained interest in two
immovable properties via two separate lease deeds of even date. One lease deed was executed for the
purpose of setting up a showroom while the other was executed for the purpose of obtaining land for
a godown. Insofar as the latter lease deed was concerned, the petitioner's sister, one, Ms. Deepika
was co-lessee. It is important to bear in mind that the petitioner had applied for being appointed as
a LPG Distributor in the category of open government personnel which included defence personnel.
This category enabled wards of the government personnel, who had lost their lives while performing
their duty to apply for LPG distributorship. The petitioner had applied to be appointed as a
distributor in Sector-18, Rohini, Delhi (hereafter referred to as "subject location").

8. The petitioner, as indicated above, on 10.10.2013 presented the aforementioned lease deeds
before the concerned Sub Registrar for the purposes of registration. Requisite stamp duty was paid
by the petitioner. Consequent thereto, the lease deed executed for the purpose of setting up a
showroom, was accorded registration no.5228, and the lease deed executed for the purpose of
obtaining land for the godown, was allocated registration no.5229.
9. Having presented the lease deeds before the Sub Registrar, for the purposes of registration, the
petitioner filed his applications with IOCL along with requisite enclosures and a demand draft in the
sum of Rs.1000/-.
10. On 14.10.2013, the concerned Sub Registrar issued certificates under Section 60 of the 1908 Act.
The certificates were issued for both lease deeds which were accorded registration nos.5228 and
5229. Since the language of the two certificates are identical, except the page numbers of the book in
which their details are entered, I am setting out, for the sake of convenience, the relevant particulars
of the certificate issued in the lease deed pertaining to the showroom: -
"Certificate (Section 60) Registration No.5228 in Book No.1, Vol. No.3,147 on page
151 to 155 on this date 11/10/2013 15:31:19 day Friday and left thumb impressions

W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 4
11. IOCL, on 25.7.2014, declared names of the applicants who were eligible for
selection as distributors, inter alia, qua Sector-18, Rohini. Pertinently, the petitioner
and his sister Ms. Deepika were the only applicants for the said location. Ms.
Deepika, it appears, did not pursue her application which left the petitioner as the
sole claimant for being appointed as a distributor in respect of the subject location.
12. Given this background, IOCL organized a draw on 18.10.2014 and declared the
petitioner as a successful candidate qua the subject location.
12.1 As a result of the above, via communication dated 20.10.2014, the petitioner was
requested by IOCL to deposit a sum of Rs.50,000/- towards security.
12.2 The petitioner complied with this request and deposited the amount via the
demand draft dated 25.10.2014, in the sum of Rs.50,000/-, which was received by
IOCL on 27.10.2014.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133190430/ 3Yogesh Kumar Malik vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Anr. on 17 April, 2018
13. It appears that IOCL got a field verification done, whereupon, a communication
dated 2.2.2015 was addressed to the petitioner. As indicated at the outset, via this
communication, the petitioner's candidature was rejected and the security amount
deposited by him in the sum of Rs.50,000/- was forfeited for having purportedly
violated the clause 11(h) of the advertisement issued by IOCL.
14. Pertinently, in this communication, IOCL stated that the subject lease deeds were
registered on 11.10.2013. There was no reference to the fact that since certificate of
registration was issued on 14.10.2013, W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 5 the subject lease
deeds would stand registered and/ or take effect from that date. This defence, it
appears, has been taken by IOCL for the first time only in the counter affidavit filed in
this Court.
15. Continuing with the narrative, the petitioner sent his response to the impugned
communication dated 2.2.2015. In his response, the petitioner emphasised the fact
that if one were to have regard to Section 75 (3) of the 1908 Act, the registration
would take effect from the date when the document was first duly presented for the
said purpose. Thus, in effect, the petitioner contended that since the subject lease
deeds were presented on 10.10.2013, in terms of Section 75 (3), they would be
deemed to have been registered on 10.10.2013 and not on 11.10.2013, as was
indicated in the impugned communication dated 2.2.2015.
15.1 IOCL, however, did not veer from its position and consequently, by a written
communication dated 18.3.2015 stuck to its stand that since the subject lease deeds
were registered on 11.10.2013, which was beyond the cut-off date, i.e., 10.10.2013, the
decision to reject the petitioner's candidature could not be altered.
16. Evidently, the petitioner did not rest his case even after having received the
response dated 18.3.2015 from IOCL, and thus, followed it up by an undated
communication wherein he placed reliance on the following three documents in
support of his case. The first document that the petitioner relied upon, was the
Brochure on Guidelines for Selection of Regular LPG Distributors (in short
"brochure"). The second document on which reliance was placed was the Application
W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 6 Format for Individual Applicants which had to be read in
conjunction with General Instructions to the candidates applying for LPG
Distributorship, and thirdly, the Format for Field Verification of Credentials of
Individual Applicants for LPG Distributor. Based on the provisions of clause-9 of the
general instructions and format for field verification, the petitioner sought to
emphasise that he was required to file documents which were executed on or before
the last date for submission of applications fixed by IOCL.
17. These clauses were pressed into service by the petitioner to demonstrate that the
date of agreement was relevant and that as long as the document was executed on or
before the last date of submission of the application, candidature of an applicant
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133190430/ 4Yogesh Kumar Malik vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Anr. on 17 April, 2018
could not be rejected on the ground that the registration of the document was carried
out on a day after the cut-off date setout for submission of the application.
17.1 This stand, quite obviously, the petitioner took in the alternative to the
submission made that the registration of subject documents would relate back to the
date when the document was first presented for registration.
18. It appears that the efforts of the petitioner did not cut much ice with IOCL and,
accordingly, it rejected the petitioner's contention vide its communication dated
3.7.2015.
19. The petitioner, however, did not relent and escalated the matter by addressing
communications to the Minister of State, Petroleum and Natural Gas and the Prime
Minister. In fact, insofar as the Minister of W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 7 State was
concerned, two communications were sent which are dated 19.8.2015 and 11.12.2015,
whereas the one which was addressed to the Prime Minister is dated 22.9.2015. The
record shows that these communications were marked to IOCL. The record shows
that the petitioner's communications were acknowledged. The Ministry marked the
petitioner's representations to IOCL, while the Prime Minister's Office marked the
petitioner's representation to the Secretary, Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.
20. Since, the petitioner, failed to get any redressal from IOCL qua his grievance, he
has knocked on the doors of this Court by taking recourse to the instant writ petition.
21. The petition came up for hearing for the first time on 22.1.2016, when, at the
request of the petitioner, it was adjourned to 8.2.2016. Though, thereafter, the matter
got listed twice, it could not be taken up for hearing. Notice in the petition was issued
only on 4.4.2016. Since then, counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of IOCL.
22. IOCL in its counter affidavit has, broadly, taken the following stand in resisting
the reliefs sought for in the petition:
22.1 One, that clause-9 of the advertisement dated 10.9.2013, inviting applications for
LPG distributorship required an applicant to file his application along with the
requisite enclosures before close of office on 10.10.2013. Furthermore, reliance was
placed on clause 11
(e) of the advertisement which provides that applications which were received after
the cut-off date, which included delay in transmission W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 8 via
post, would not be considered. The stance of IOCL is that since the lease deeds were
not registered on 10.10.2013, the application was not complete and hence, rightly
rejected.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133190430/ 5Yogesh Kumar Malik vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Anr. on 17 April, 2018
22.2 Two, the acceptance of the security deposit after the petitioner had been declared as the
successful candidate, was subject to the caveat that if, on completion of field verification of
credentials, it was found that the information furnished in the application was false or incorrect, or
did not represent the correct state of affairs, then, not only would the candidature be cancelled but
also the security amount would be forfeited. This submission was supported by placing reliance on
clause-11 (h) of the advertisement dated 10.9.2013.
22.3 Three, IOCL was required to act in accordance with its own rules and regulations which
included advertisement conditions and since, the petitioner had infracted the same, his candidature
was rightly rejected.
22.4 Four, the defect was not curable in view of the terms stipulated in the advertisement inviting
applications from prospective LPG distributors.
Submissions of Counsels
23. Arguments of counsels have, principally, veered around the issue as to what would be the date of
registration of the subject lease deeds given the factual matrix of this case.
24.1 The petitioner's case was propounded by Mr. Colin Gonsalves, Sr. Advocate, instructed by Mrs.
Sija Nair Pal, Advocate, while IOCL W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 9 was represented by Ms. Mala
Narayan. Though, respondent no.2/UOI was, strictly speaking, not a contesting party, it was
represented by Mr. Kavindra Gill.
25. Mr. Gonsalves emphasised the fact that the date of registration would be the date on which the
subject lease deeds were executed or in the alternative, when they were presented for registration. In
support of his submissions, learned counsel relied upon the following judgments: -
(i) Hamda Ammal v. Avadiappa Pathar and Ors., (1991) 1 SCC 715
(ii) Gurbax Singh v. Kartar Singh & Ors., (2002) 2 SCC 611
(iii) Thakur Kisan Singh (Dead) v. Arvind Kumar, (1994) 6 SCC 591
(iv) T.V. Kalyanasundaram Pillai v. Karuppa Mooppanar & Ors., AIR 1927 PC 42
(v) Venkatsubba Shrinivas Hegde v. Subba Rama Hegde, AIR 1928 PC 86.
26. To buttress the aforesaid submissions, Mr. Gonsalves relied upon Section 47 and 75(3) of the
1908 Act, to contend, as indicated above, that the document would come into effect on the date
when it was executed or in any event, when it was duly presented for registration and not from the
date of actual registration. Furthermore, reliance was also placed on the instructions issued by the
Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas dated 21.1.2015 and 25.2.2016, to contend that a
hyper-technical view ought not to be taken in construing lease deeds. These circulars mandated that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133190430/ 6Yogesh Kumar Malik vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Anr. on 17 April, 2018
the 15 year period for a lease W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 10 should be reckoned from the date of
advertisement; stricto-sensu this is not the issue which arises for consideration in the instant case.
26.1 Furthermore, Mr. Gonsalves also sought to place reliance on the Circular dated 12.11.2014
issued by the Office of the Inspector General of Registration, Department of Revenue. This Circular
contains guidelines issued by the said office under Section 69 of the 1908 Act, for the benefit of the
Sub Registrars located in NCT of Delhi. In particular, my attention was drawn to clause-16 (i) and
(ii) of the guidelines. Furthermore, insofar as the Format for Field Verification of Credentials of
Individual Applicants for LPG Distributor was concerned, specific emphasis was laid on Item-9 of
column "C" of the said format. The relevant part of this column reads as follows: -
"Original Registered Sale Deed/ gift Deed/ lease deed. In case of inherited property
verify mutation and government record Date of agreement/ mutation has to be
before or on the last date for submission of application as specified in the
advertisement or corrigendum (if any)."
27. Ms. Mala Narayan, who appeared for IOCL, broadly, argued in line with the stand taken in the
counter affidavit. It was submitted by the learned counsel that the date of registration would be the
date when a certificate for registration is issued in terms of Section 61 of the 1908 Act. According to
the counsel, certificate of registration was evidence of the fact that the documents were complete in
all respects as per the extant provisions of law. It was contended by the learned counsel that Section
47 of the 1908 Act which provides that W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 11 registration of the document
relates back to the day of its execution, would only kick in after registration stood completed. Since,
registration stood completed in the instant case only on 14.10.2013, the fact that the subject
documents were executed on 9.10.2013 would not advance the case of the petitioner. In support of
her submissions, learned counsel relied upon the following judgments:
(i) Ram Saran Lall and Ors. vs. MST Domoni Kuer and Ors., (1962) 2 SCR 474;
(ii) Hiralal Agrawal vs. Rampadarath Singh and Ors., (1969) 1 SCR 328;
(iii) Har Narain (Dead) by LRs vs. Mam Chand (Dead) by LRs and Ors., (2010) 13 SCC 128;
(iv) Commissioner of Gift Tax vs. Smt. Aloka Lata Sett and Ors., (1992) 103 CTR (Cal) 343; and
(v) Chandrika Singh (dead) through LRs vs. Arvind Kumar Singh (dead) by LRs and Ors., (2006) 10
SCC 404.
Reasons
28. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, and perused the records, according to me,
what emerges is as follows: -
(i) That the subject lease deeds were executed on 9.10.2013;
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133190430/ 7Yogesh Kumar Malik vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Anr. on 17 April, 2018
(ii) The subject lease deeds were presented in the office of the concerned Sub
Registrar on 10.10.2013, when, they were accorded two separate numbers, these
being: 5228 & 5229.
W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 12
(iii) The certificate of registration under Section 60 vis-à-vis the subject lease deeds
were issued on 14.10.2013.
29. In the context of these brief undisputed facts, the argument advanced by Ms. Mala Narayan on
behalf of IOCL is that the registration of a document is complete only when the endorsement and
the certificate referred to and mentioned in Section 59 & 60 of 1908 Act are copied into the margin
of the register-book and the copy of the map or plan (if any) mentioned in Section 21 is filed in book
no.1.
29.1 Ms. Narayan further submitted, as adverted to above, that Section 47 of the 1908 Act would
come into play only after registration is complete as per the provisions of Section 61 of the 1908 Act.
29.2 In support of her submissions, learned counsel relied upon certain judgments to which I would
be making reference hereafter.
29.3 The first judgment on which Ms. Narayan placed reliance was the judgment of the Supreme
Court rendered in Ram Saran Lall and Others v. MST Domini Kuer and Others. This was a case
where the appellants had their house contiguous to the house owned by certain persons who, in the
judgment, are referred to as 'Pandeys'. On 31.1.1946, the Pandeys executed a sale deed in favour of
the respondent-purchaser before the Court in respect of their house. The appellants before the
Court, even though they were Hindus (and so were the other parties to the litigation), by custom,
were entitled to exercise a right of pre-emption, which they did, on account of W.P.(C) 559/2016
Page 13 execution of the sale deed by Pandeys in favour of the respondent- purchaser. The exercise
of the right of pre-emption by the appellants was not in dispute before the Court, but what was in
dispute before the Court was, as to when it could be said that the sale stood completed in the given
fact situation.
29.4 Crucially, the sale deed provided that it became operative from the date when the executants
had affixed their signatures on it and that the title of the executants and their heirs with respect to
the subject property had become extinct, inoperative, null and void. In effect, the sale deed provided
that from the date of execution, the right, title and interest in the subject property stood transferred
in favour of the respondent-purchaser.
29.5 The sale deed, it appears, was presented by Pandeys on the day it was executed and it was left
with the Registrar, in the Registration Office, for incorporating necessary entries and copies in the
statutory records. The appellants on becoming aware of the sale by the Pandeys, exercised their
right of pre-emption by making the first demand, i.e., talab-i-mowasibat.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133190430/ 8Yogesh Kumar Malik vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Anr. on 17 April, 2018
29.6 Evidently, on 7.2.1946, Pandeys handed over the receipt issued by the Registration Office to the
respondent-purchaser who, thereupon, paid the balance sale consideration.
29.7 On 9.2.1946, documents were copied in the Registrar's books as provided under Section 61 of
the 1908 Act. The respondent-purchaser received the sale deed from the Registrar's office on
13.2.1946. The W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 14 appellants filed a suit for pre-emption on 9.9.1946. The
appellants succeeded before the trial court; a decision which was sustained by the first appellate
Court. The decision of the courts below was, however, overturned by the concerned High Court in
the second appeal which resulted in the dismissal of the suit. This is how the appellants approached
the Supreme Court.
30. Since, the right of pre-emption was exercised under the Mohammedan Law, the Court cited
Mulla's principles on Mohammedan Law which encapsulated the right of pre-emption as stated
hereafter: -
"The right of pre-emption arises only out of a valid, complete and bona fide sale."
30.1 In the context of the facts obtaining in the case, the arguments advanced on behalf of the
appellants that the sale would become operative from the date of its execution once the registration
was complete, was rejected. The reasoning given by the Court is contained in paragraph 8, which for
the sake of convenience is extracted hereafter: -
"We do not think that the learned Attorney-General's contention is well founded. We
will assume that the learned Attorney-General's construction of the instrument of
sale that the property was intended to pass under it on the date of the instrument is
correct. Section 47 of the Registration Act does not, however, say when a sale would
be deemed to be complete. It only permits a document when registered, to operate
from a certain date which may be earlier than the date when it was registered. The
object of this W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 15 section is to decide which of two or more
registered instruments in respect of the same property is to have effect. The section
applies to a document only after it has been registered. It has nothing to do with the
completion of the registration and therefore nothing to do with the completion of a
sale when the instrument is one of sale. A sale which is admittedly not completed
until the registration of the instrument of sale is completed, cannot be said to have
been completed earlier because by virtue of Section 47 the instrument by which it is
effected, after it has been registered, commences to operate from an earlier date.
Therefore we do not think that the sale in this case can be said, in view of Section 47,
to have been completed on January 31, 1946. The view that we have taken of Section
47 of the Registration Act seems to have been taken in Tilakdhari Singh v. Gour
Narain. We believe that the same view was expressed in Nareshchandra Datta v.
Gireeshchandra Das and Gobardhan Bar v. Guna Dhar Bar."
(emphasis is mine) 30.2 I may point out that Hon'ble Mr. Justice Ayyangar (as he then was) along
with another learned Judge of the Court rendered the minority opinion. The observations of Hon'ble
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133190430/ 9Yogesh Kumar Malik vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Anr. on 17 April, 2018
Mr. Justice Ayyangar on law took a diametrically opposite view. Since, the view raised an interesting
counter point with regard to when a sale transaction stands completed, it would be relevant to refer
to the minority view as well:
"Turning now to the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, in the case of a sale of
immovable property of the value of Rs. 100 or over (as in the case before us) Section
54 of the Act enacts that it could be effected only by a registered instrument; sale
itself being defined as "transfer of ownership in exchange for a price paid or W.P.(C)
559/2016 Page 16 promised or part paid and part promised". In other words, the
essence of a transaction of sale consists in the transfer of ownership and this transfer
has to be effected by "a registered instrument". The Transfer of Property Act while
prescribing the formalities of writing and Registration, does not itself determine the
point of time when a sale becomes complete. "Registered" under the Transfer of
Property Act means: "registered under the law for the time being in force regulating
the registration of documents" (Section 3). When one turns to the Registration Act,
provision is made, inter alia, for the time within which after its execution a document
could be presented for registration, the persons who could so present, the office in
which the document could validly be presented and registration effected and sub-part
B of Part 11 starting from Section 58 deals with the procedure on admitting
documents to registration.
Section 60(1) enacts:
"After such of the provisions of sections 34, 35, 58 and 59 as apply to any document
presented for registration have been complied with, the registering officer shall
endorse thereon a certificate containing the word registered', together with the
number and page of the book in which the document has been copied."
and Section 61 which follows makes provision for the copying of documents in public registers from
which the word "registration" is derived and enacts:
"61. (1). The endorsements and certificate referred to and mentioned in Sections 59
and 60 shall thereupon be copied into the margin of the register book, and the copy
of the map or plan (if any) mentioned in Section 21 shall be filed in Book No. 1.
W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 17 (2)The registration of the document shall thereupon be
deemed complete, and the document shall then be returned to the person who
presented the same for registration, or to such other person (if any) as he has
nominated in writing in that behalf on the receipt mentioned in Section 52."
Much reliance has been placed by learned Counsel for the respondent and, indeed, in the judgment
of the High Court, on the words the "registration of the document shall thereupon be deemed
complete" occurring in sub- section. (2) of Section 61, but in the context of the fasciculus of sections
in which it appears it is clear that it refers to the fact that the registering officer had completed his
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133190430/ 10Yogesh Kumar Malik vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Anr. on 17 April, 2018
duty and had no more to do with the document presented to him, beyond returning the original to
the party entitled to receive the same. In our opinion, these words have nothing to do with the time
from which the transaction covered by the registered document operates or with reference to the
present context, when the sale evidenced by the deed, becomes complete. Specific provision is made
for these in Section 47 of the Registration Act which reads:
"A registered document shall operate from the time from which it would have
commenced to operate if no registration thereof had been required or made, and not
from the time of its registration."
The principles underlying Sections 61(2) and 47 are not divergent. It is not as if, that any delay by
the regis- tering officer which might take place owing to the pressure of work in his office or for
other reason, has any effect on the rights of parties, quod their property or the time from when the
deed operates, or as regards the effectiveness of the transaction, or the priority of transactions inter
se. It is not as if, documents executed on different dates, the parties intending them to operate
W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 18 at different times, have their intentions modified, if not nullified by the
action or inaction of the registering officer, or any delay that might take place in his office. A
contention that though the Muslim law of sale is superseded by the Transfer of Property Act and the
Registration Act, but yet the provision contained in Section 47 of the Registration Act is inapplicable
to determine when a sale effected by a registered instrument should be complete could not be
sustained on any principle or logic, or of course on any rule of interpretation of statutes. In our
opinion, no distinction is possible to be drawn between a sale which is effective and one which is
complete since they are merely different forms of expressing the same concept and for the same
reason between the time from when a sale becomes effective and when it should be held to be
complete. As under Muslim law the talabs have to be performed only immediately after the
pre-emptor receives information of the sale, the view we take of the applicability of s. 47 of the
Registration Act, introduces no element of hardship in the exercise of the option. We are, therefore,
clearly of the opinion that the time when the sale becomes complete so as to entitle the preemptor to
perform the talabs should be determined by the application of the principle of intention laid down in
Section 47 of the Registration Act which is as much a part of the positive law governing the right of
pre-emption as the provision of Section 54 of the Transfer of Property Act which requires a
registered instrument to effect a sale which gives rise to a right of pre-emption.
17. If, therefore, Section 47 of the Registration Act should apply to determine the time from which
the registered document should have effect or, in other words, the time from which the sale should
be held to be complete, the intention of the parties would be the crucial and only test. That has to be
gathered by reference to the document itself read in the light of the surrounding circumstances, with
however a proviso that if the W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 19 document were clear and its terms explicit,
no evidence to contradict them would be admissible."
(emphasis is mine)
31. Therefore, the majority view in Ram Saran Lall(cid:129)s case turned in favour of the respondent
purchaser based on the crucial fact that the right of pre-emption in Mohammedan Law would arise
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133190430/ 11Yogesh Kumar Malik vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Anr. on 17 April, 2018
when the sale was complete. In other words, right of pre-emption could not be triggered till such
time the registration of the sale deed stood completed as per the 1908 Act. The judgment, to my
mind, did not deal with the issue as to what would be the deemed date of registration. In other
words, the judgment did not expound on the issue, which is, after the completion of registration
would the factum of registration relate back to the date when the document was first presented for
registration. Since, this aspect did not arise for consideration, the Court had no occasion to rule on
this aspect of the matter. Therefore, according to me, this judgment cannot advance the case of
IOCL.
32. The second judgment i.e., the Hiralal Agrawal case, on which reliance was placed, came about in
the background of the following brief facts:
32.1 The appellant before the Court was seeking re-conveyance of the subject
property under Section 16 (3) of the Bihar Land Reforms (Fixation of Ceiling Area
and Acquisition of Surplus Land) Act, 1962 (in short "1962 Act"). The appellant's
right of re-conveyance qua the subject property was sought to be resisted on the
ground that when the W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 20 application was filed, the transfer of
the subject property was not complete on account of the fact that registration of the
sale deed had taken place after the date when the application for re-conveyancing the
subject property, was filed. The Supreme Court following the view held in Ram Saran
Lall(cid:129)s case, on the first point, found against the appellant. However, it ruled in favour
of the appellant on the other issue and, ultimately, allowed the appeal. The second
issue which was raised before it was, as to what would be the effect of the application
for re-conveyance not being accompanied by a registered sale deed.
In this context, the Court examined the provisions of Rule 19 (3) of the Bihar Land Reforms
(Fixation of Ceiling Area and Acquisition of Surplus Land) Rules, 1963 (in short "1963 Rules"). The
Court came to the conclusion that, though the Rules used the word "shall" in Clause-3 of Rule 19 of
1963 Rules, inasmuch as there was a requirement that the application for re-conveyance had to be
accompanied by a registered sale deed, the words were only directory as Rule 19 did not lay down
the consequences of non-compliance of its provisions.
32.2 The observations, though, made by the Supreme Court in this case with respect to the first
point, which as indicated above, were on the same lines as Ram Saran Lall(cid:129)s case, are set forth as
follows: -
"11. When the appellant lodged his application in the Collector's office he had already
deposited the requisite amount in the treasury and had annexed thereto the copy of
the challan. So that the condition under Section 16 was complied with. The
application was also filed within the time prescribed by the section. Under Section
16(2) and W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 21 (3), however, no transfer takes place unless the
sale deed is registered. Registration is complete only when the certificate under
Section 60 is given and the endorsement and copying out the said certificate under
Section 61 of the Registration Act are made. But Mr. Desai argued that under Section
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133190430/ 12Yogesh Kumar Malik vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Anr. on 17 April, 2018
47 of that Act ,once registration is effected, the title under the sale deed relates back
to the date of its execution and therefore though registration was completed on
November 30, 1964, the transferee's title under the sale deed related back to the date
of its execution i.e., October 9, 1964. Assuming, therefore, that the application was
presented on November 26, 1964, the transferee's title having related back to the date
of the execution of the sale deed, the transfer must be deemed to be complete on that
date and, therefore, it was not correct that the right of reconveyance had not accrued
to the appellant on November 26, 1964 or that the Collector had no jurisdiction on
that date to accept the said application. This contention, however, cannot be accepted
in view of the decision in Ram Saran Lal v. Mst.
Domini Kuer where this Court rejected an identical contention. Mr. Desai tried to distinguish that
case on the ground that it was based on Mahomedan law which by custom applied to the parties
there. But the decision is based not on any principle of Mahomedan law but on the effect of Section
47 of the Registration Act. The majority decision clearly laid down that the sale there was completed
only when registration of the sale deed was completed as contemplated by Section 61 of the
Registration Act and, therefore, the talab-i-mowasibat made before the date of completion of
registration was premature and a suit based on such a demand of the right of pre-emption was
premature and must, therefore, fail. Similarly, in Radhakishan L. Toshniwal v. Shridhar this Court
laid down that where a statute providing for the right of pre-emption lays down that it accrues only
when transfer of the property takes place and such transfer is not complete except through a
registered deed, a suit filed before the sale deed is executed is premature as the W.P.(C) 559/2016
Page 22 right of pre-emption under the statute did not accrue till the transfer became effective
through a registered deed. In Bishan Singh v. Khazan Singh this Court laid down that in a suit for
preemption the plaintiff must show that the right had acquired to him at the time when he exercised
it."
(emphasis is mine)
33. The third case which was cited by Ms. Mala Narayan, is the judgment rendered by the Supreme
Court in Har Narain (Dead) by LRs v. Mam Chand (Dead) by LRs and Ors., (2010) 13 SCC 128. This
was a case in which the Supreme Court was called upon to consider whether the doctrine of lis
pendens would apply in a case where the suit was filed after the subject sale deed was executed but
before its registration. The Court, once again, following the decisions in Ram Saran Lall and Hira Lal
Agrawal came to the conclusion that the doctrine of lis pendens would apply since the sale was
completed only upon registration. The observations made in this behalf in paragraph 23 are
extracted hereafter: -
"23. In view of the above, we reach the inescapable conclusion that the sale executed
by Respondent No.1 in favour of Respondents 2 to 6 on 2.8.1971 could not be termed
as a complete sale until the document got registered on 3.9.1971. In view of the
provisions of Section 47 of the 1908 Act the effect of registration would be that
registration would relate back to the date of execution but it does not mean that sale
would be complete in favour of Respondents 2 to 6 prior to 3.9.1971 i.e. the date of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133190430/ 13Yogesh Kumar Malik vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Anr. on 17 April, 2018
registration of the sale deed. In view of the above, as sale stood completed during the
pendency of the suit, the doctrine of lis pendens is applicable in the facts and
circumstances of the case. The W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 23 courts below failed to
appreciate that the fiction created by Section 47 of the 1908 Act, itself is a
consequence of registration of the sale deed. More so, as the appellant had been in
possession of the suit land being a mortgagee since 1970 and this fact had also been
mentioned by Respondent No.1 in the sale deed dated 2.8.1971 in favour of
Respondents 2 to 6, the question of Respondents 2 to 6 being bona-fide purchasers
for value and paid money in good faith without notice does not arise, simply for the
reason that the said respondents were fully aware that the suit land was in possession
of the appellant. Thus, Respondents 2 to 6 cannot take the benefit of the provisions of
Section 19(b) of the 1963 Act."
(emphasis is mine)
34. The fourth case on which reliance was placed by Ms. Narayan was the judgment of the Calcutta
High Court dated 3.7.1989, passed in Matter (Gift-tax) No.385 of 1984, titled: Commissioner of Gift
Tax v. Smt. Aloka Lata Sett and Ors. This was a case where the Court was called upon to consider as
to whether the value of immovable property gifted to the assessee via a deed executed on 13.4.1973
but registered on 13.7.1973 should be deleted from the total taxable gift of the assessee pertaining to
assessment year 1974-75. The Court answered the question in favour of the revenue and against the
assessee. It was the assessee's contention that the transaction should be factored in the assessment
year 1973-74 and not in assessment year 1974-75 as contended by the revenue. In doing so, the
Court relied upon, inter alia, the view taken by the Supreme Court in Ram Saran Lall(cid:129)s case.
Observations made which were crucial to the deposition of the case W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 24 are
contained in paragraph 7, 8 & 18 of the judgment. The relevant parts are extracted hereafter: -
"7. Section 17(1)(a) of the Registration Act provides that an instrument of gift of
immovable property requires registration under the said Act whatever be the value of
the property.
8. Sections 122 and 123 of the Transfer of Property Act leave no room for doubt that a
transaction of transfer of immovable property will be complete only by executing a
registered document subject to other conditions being fulfilled, In the present case,
the document has been executed in one assessment year but it has been registered in
the subsequent assessment year. Since, on a combined reading of Sections 122 and
123, it is evident that the transaction of gift would be complete provided a registered
document is executed and other conditions are fulfilled, it cannot be said that the
transaction was complete and a gift in the eye of law came to be made by the donor to
the donee prior to the registration of the document by which the gift was made. If the
donor dies before registration, the document may be presented for registration after
his death. Such registration will have the same effect as registration during his
lifetime. But reliance was placed on Section 47 of the Registration Act which provides
that a registered document shall operate from the time from which it would have
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133190430/ 14Yogesh Kumar Malik vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Anr. on 17 April, 2018
commenced to operate if no registration thereof had been required or made and not
from the time of its registration. Under Section 47, a registered document operates
from the date of its execution and not from the date of its registration. The result is
that if two registered documents are executed by the same person in respect of the
same property to two different persons at different times, the one which was executed
first has priority over the other, although the former was registered subsequent to the
latter. In other W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 25 words, registration of a document relates
to the date of its execution. This is so between the parties to the document. But, as
regards third parties, it is effective from the date of registration.
XXX XXX XXX
18. In our view, the decisions of the Supreme Court squarely apply to the facts of this
case. The transfer is not effective until registration of the deed of transfer, whether by
gift or sale. The effective date would be the date of registration and not the date of
execution. Before registration of the deed, Section 47 has no application and before
registration of the deed, the gift does not become effective. As observed by the
Supreme Court, the object of Section 47 is to decide which of the two or more
registered instruments in respect of the same property is to have effect. Although, by
virtue of Section 47, a document when registered is permitted to operate from a date
anterior to registration, the gift or sale made by the said document cannot be said to
have been completed earlier to the date of registration. The gift is not complete until
the registration. Accordingly, the date of registration of the deed of gift would be
relevant for the purpose of gift-tax assessment."
35. The last case cited is Chandrika Singh which also dealt with an application preferred under
Section 16 (3) of the 1962 Act. The Court following the view taken in Ram Saran Lall and Hiralal
Agrarwal allowed the appeal. The relevant observations contained in paragraph 13 are extracted
hereafter: -
"As noted hereinbefore, the first sale deed was executed on 10.8.1983 in favour of
Paras Sah, which was registered on 14.6. 1984. Therefore, it cannot be disputed that
the sale deed registered on 14.6.1984 could be pre- empted only within three months
from 14.6.1984.
W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 26 Admittedly, in this case, the application for pre-emption
was filed on 17.7.1984 i.e. well within the limitation period of 3 months. At the same
time, it is also not in dispute that the second sale deed, which was executed by Paras
Sah in favour of Ghurla Kuer for a consideration of Rs.4000/- was registered on
31.8.1984, that is, after the registration of the first sale deed and after the pre-
emption application, under Section 16(3) of the Act, was filed by the appellant, on
17.7.1984. Further, under Section 16(2) of the Act, a sale is complete only when the
document of transfer is registered and unless the registration is complete under
section 60 of the Registration Act, the transfer of the land in question would still be
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133190430/ 15Yogesh Kumar Malik vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Anr. on 17 April, 2018
inchoate. From a plain reading of section 16(3) of the Act it is clear that a pre-emptor
can only be permitted to file the pre-emption application within 3 months from the
date of registration of transfer deed. Therefore, the right to file the pre-emption
application under section 16(3) of the Act accrues only when the registration of the
document is completed. In Radhakisan L. Toshniwal vs. Shridhar, this Court held
that where a statute provides for a right of pre-emption, it will accrue only when the
transfer of the land takes place and such transfer is not complete before the deed is
registered. Accordingly, this Court held that an application for pre- emption filed
before the sale deed was registered, would be pre-mature. This view was appreciated
again by this Court in Ram Saran Lall vs. Domini Kuer. Further, in Hiralal Agrawal
vs. Rampadarath Singh, Shelat, J. (as his Lordship then was), clearly observed that
under section 16(2) and (3) of the Act, no transfer takes place unless the deed is
registered. Registration is complete when the certificate under the provisions of the
Registration Act is issued. That being the position, we are of the view that the right of
re-conveyance accrues to the pre-emptor only on the date of the completion of the
registration of the transfer deed and an application for pre-emption under Section
16(3) of the Act filed before such date would be premature. Therefore, we hold that
W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 27 the pre-emptor, Chandrika Singh, appellant herein, was
entitled to file the pre-emption application against Paras Sah, only after the first sale
deed was registered on
14.6.1984 and not before that date. It is clear that the registration of the sale deed executed in favour
of Smt. Ghurla Kuer by Paras Sah was not complete and effective, for want of registration, when the
application for pre-emption was filed by Chandrika Singh against Paras Sah. Accordingly, we do not
find any reason to hold that the application for pre-emption, filed by Chandrika Singh could not be
maintained against Paras Sah, the first transferee."
36. This brings me to the judgments cited by Mr. Gonsalves. The first in line is the judgment of the
Supreme Court in Hamda Ammal v. Avadiappa Pathar and Ors., this was a case where the appellant
before the Court had purchased the suit property via a sale deed executed in her favour on
09.09.1970. This sale deed was registered on 26.10.1970. In the interregnum, the respondent no.1,
before the Court, had filed a money suit on 13.09.1970 against the vendors and obtained an order of
attachment before judgment in respect of the suit property on 17.09.1970. The money suit was
decreed in favour of respondent no.1. Respondent no.5, one, Mr. Kadar got rights in the suit
property in a Court sale when the decree obtained by respondent no.1 was sought to be executed.
The question which arose before the Court was, whether the appellant could claim rights in the suit
property based on the date of execution of the sale deed though the registration of the sale deed in
respect of the same, took place after the money suit was instituted, and an order for attachment
before judgment was passed by the suit Court. The judgments rendered by W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page
28 the Supreme Court in the matter of: Ram Saran Lall and Hiralal Agrawal were cited.
36.1 The Supreme Court distinguished both these judgments. Observations in this behalf are made
in paragraphs 7 to 9 of the judgment. Suffice it to say qua Ram Saran Lal, the Court observed that
the case dealt with the question as and when the sale became complete to enable making the first
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133190430/ 16Yogesh Kumar Malik vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Anr. on 17 April, 2018
demand, which is adverted to as talab-i-mowsabit under the mohammedan law of pre-emption.
36.2 In so far as Hiralal(cid:129)s case was concerned, the Court noted that the application for
re-conveyance was taken cognizance of by the Collector only on a particular date i.e., 30.11.1964 and
not on a date prior to the said date.
36.3 I am not reiterating in detail once again the judgments of the Supreme Court in Ram Saran Lall
and Hiralal as they have been discussed in some detail in the earlier part of the judgment. Suffice it
to say that the Supreme Court in Hiralal(cid:129)s case, granted relief in that matter, as noticed by me
hereinabove, notwithstanding the fact that a copy of the registered deed was not furnished along
with the application, as according to it, the Collector was not emasculated of his jurisdiction to
entertain the application for re-conveyance.
36.4 Insofar the case at hand was concerned, the Court made the following crucial observations: -
"4. Section 54 of the Act defines Sale as "a transfer of ownership in exchange for a
price paid or promised or W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 29 part-paid and part-promised."
Thus after the execution of the sale deed with consideration all the ingredients of sale
are fulfilled except that in case of tangible immovable property of the value of Rs. 100
and upwards it can be made only by registered instrument. Now, if we read Section
47 of the Registration Act, it clearly provides that a registered document shall operate
from the time from which it would have commenced to operate if no registration
thereof had been required or made and not from the time of its registration. This
provision makes it clear that after the registration it will relate back to the date of
execution of the sale deed. The act of registration is to be performed by the
registering authority. According to Section 23 of the Registration Act a document of
the nature of sale deed shall be accepted for registration within four months from the
date of its execution. Thus a statutory period of four months has been provided for
presenting the sale deed for registration from the date of its execution. In case of
dispute regarding the execution of the document an enquiry is permitted under
Section 74(a) of the Registration Act and that may also take some time. The
Legislature being alive of such situations has already provided in Section 47 of the
Registration Act that it shall operate from the time from which it would commence to
operate if no registration thereof had been required or made and not from the time of
its registration. Thus in our view the vendee gets rights which will be related back on
registration from the date of the execution of the sale deed and such rights are
protected under Order XXXVIII Rule 10 C.P.C. read together with Section 47 of the
Registration Act.
5. We cannot accept the contention of learned counsel for the respondent that till
registration, the execution of the sale deed does not confer any rights whatsoever on
the vendee. Even Section 49 of the Registration Act in its proviso inserted by Section
10 of the Transfer of Property (Amendment) Supplementary W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page
30 Act, 1929, negatives the above contention of the learned counsel. The above
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133190430/ 17Yogesh Kumar Malik vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Anr. on 17 April, 2018
provision lays down that an unregistered document affecting immovable property
and required by this Act or by the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, to be registered
may be received as evidence of a contract in a suit for specific performance under
Chapter II of the Specific Relief Act, 1877, or as an evidence of part performance of a
contract for the purposes of Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, or as
evidence of any collateral transaction not required to be affected by registered
instrument. Thus even an unregistered document can be received as evidence for
purposes mentioned in the proviso to Section 49 of the Registration Act.
6. Learned counsel for the respondents also made the submission that even if the sale
deed which is executed earlier to attachment before judgment and registered
subsequently may be binding on the vendors but it would not affect the rights of such
respondent who is a third party, in the sense that he was not a party to the sale deed
and he got the right in the property in a court sale having taken place after the
passing of final decree in the money suit filed by Avadiappa. In other words the
contention is that the respondent No. 5 Shri M.S.A. Kadar got rights in the property
in the court sale made in his favour after the decree passed in favour of Avadiappa in
the money suit filed on 13.9.1970. We do not find any force at all in the above
submission. The property in question admittedly belonged to the
defendant-judgment debtors (vendors) and once it is held that a sale deed had
already been executed by them in favour of Hamda Ammal on 9.9.1970 and only its
registration remained, then neither the attachment before judgment nor a
subsequent attachment or court sale in favour of respondent No. 5 can confer any
title in his favour by preventing the relation back. The fact that the document of sale
had not been registered until after the attachment makes no difference."
W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 31
37. Similarly, Gurbax Singh was a case where the Supreme Court was called upon to
rule whether priority of rights would be determined keeping in mind, the date of
registration or the execution. In this case, two sale documents, Ex. P-2 and D-1, were
executed on the same date i.e., 25.11.1991 but at different points in time. The evidence
showed that, though, Ex. P-2 was executed prior in time to Ex. D-1, it was registered,
apparently, at a later date.
37.1 Given these facts, the Court held that Ex.P-2 would prevail Ex.D-1. The reason furnished for
reaching this conclusion was that though both documents were executed on the same date, Ex.P-2
was executed prior in point of time. The fact that Ex.P-2 was registered later, was disregarded.
38. The third case cited on behalf of the petitioner was the judgment rendered by the Supreme Court
in Thakur Kishan Singh. The defendant in the suit for possession was the appellant before the
Supreme Court. The respondent-plaintiff had a lease deed dated 5.12.1949 executed in his favour by
the lambardar, which was registered on 03.04.1950.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133190430/ 18Yogesh Kumar Malik vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Anr. on 17 April, 2018
38.1 The appellant-defendant was permitted by the respondent- plaintiff to set up a brick-kiln in the
subject area. The appellant- defendant had been in possession of the subject area since 1960-61. It
appears that appellant-defendant, who had set up a house in adjoining parcel of land, made
encroachments in the subject area. This propelled the respondent-plaintiff to institute a suit for
possession.
W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 32 38.2 One of the defences which the appellant-defendant raised before the
Court was that since the subject lease deed was registered by the respondent-plaintiff on
03.04.1950, it was void under the provisions of Section 6 of the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of
Proprietary Rights Act, 1950 as the subject area had vested in the State on 31.03.1950 (1950 Act).
Furthermore, an alternative defence of adverse possession was also raised by the
appellant-defendant.
38.3 The trial court rejected the defence raised by the appellant- defendant with respect to the
aspect that the lease deed had been rendered void in view of the intercession of Section 6 of 1950
Act, but thereafter, went on to dismiss the suit on the ground that the appellant- defendant had
acquired rights in the subject area by way of adverse possession.
38.4 In the appeal preferred by the respondent-plaintiff, the trial court judgment was reversed, and
the suit was decreed. This position continued all throughout uptil the stage of second appeal which
was disposed of by the concerned High Court.
38.5 It is in this background that the appellant-defendant propounded its case before the Supreme
Court.
38.6 On the aspect with which we are concerned, the Supreme Court made the following
observations: -
"3. The findings recorded by the High Court and the trial court have been assailed by
Shri Sen, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant, and it is W.P.(C)
559/2016 Page 33 claimed that the lease deed having been registered after the
material date, it could not confer any title on the respondent as the right
title-in-interest of the respondent(cid:129)s predecessor already stood vested in the State
prior to registration of the lease deed. The argument does not appear to be sound.
Section 47 of the Registration Act provides that a registered document shall operate
from the time it would have commenced to operate if no registration thereof had
been required or made and not from the time of its registration. It is well established
that a document so long it is not registered is not valid yet once it is registered it takes
effect from the date of its execution. (See Ram Saran Lall v. Mst Domini Kuer and
Nanda Ballabh Gururani v. Smt. Maqbool Begum). Since, admittedly, the lease deed
was executed on 5.12.1949, the plaintiff after registration of it on 3.4.1950 became
owner by operation of law on the date when the deed was executed. Therefore, the
land did not vest in the State. And the courts below did not commit any error in
negativing the claim of appellant."
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133190430/ 19Yogesh Kumar Malik vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Anr. on 17 April, 2018
(emphasis is mine) 38.7 I may also note, for reason of completion of narration, that on the issue of
adverse possession, the Supreme Court ruled against the appellant-defendant on the ground that the
entry into the subject area, to begin with, was permissive, and that there was no evidence on record
that this possession had become hostile or adverse to the knowledge of the real owner i.e.,
respondent-plaintiff. The appeal was, accordingly, dismissed.
39. This brings me to two interesting and instructive judgments of the Privy Council cited on behalf
of the petitioner. I may also note that one of these judgments, which I am going to refer immediately
W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 34 i.e., T.V. Kalyana Sundaram Pillai(cid:129)s case, was cited with approval by the
Supreme Court in Hamda Ammal(cid:129)s case.
40. T.V. Kalyana Sundaram Pillai(cid:129)s case involved the following brief facts:
40.1. On 09.09.1891, Vaithilingam Pillai executed a trust deed for the purpose of
charity, which included maintenance of religious services in certain temples. In order
to provide necessary funds for maintenance of religious services in the temples and
for performance of other charitable duties which were imposed on the trustees, he set
apart certain immovable properties belonging to him, the income from which was to
be devoted for the purposes of the trust.
40.2 Since, Mr. Vaithilingam Pillai had no son, on 10.09.1891, he executed an
adoption deed whereby he appointed the appellant before the Court, who, at that
point in time, was aged 5 years, as his son. On 11.09.1891, Vaithilingam Pillai
executed a deed of guardianship, followed by a deed of partition, which was executed
a day after, that is, on 12.09.1891.
40.3 It was not in dispute before the Court that the vesting of immovable properties
by Vaithilingam Pillai in favour of trust constituted a gift within the meaning of
Section 123, and that the trust deed, which encapsulated the gift, was duly delivered
to the trustees named in the trust deed. What was also not in dispute was that the
trust deed was registered after the adoption of the appellant which is on 10.09.1891.
W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 35 40.4 The Court was, thus, required to consider the
provisions of Section 122 and 123 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 "(Transfer of
Property Act)". For understanding the ratio of the decision, the relevant statutory
provisions are set forth hereafter:
"122. "Gift" defined.--"Gift" is the transfer of certain existing moveable or immovable
property made voluntarily and without consideration, by one person, called the
donor, to another, called the donee, and accepted by or on behalf of the donee.
Acceptance when to be made.--Such acceptance must be made during the lifetime of
the donor and while he is still capable of giving. If the donee dies before acceptance,
the gift is void.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133190430/ 20Yogesh Kumar Malik vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Anr. on 17 April, 2018
123. Transfer how effected. -- For the purpose of making a gift of immovable
property, the transfer must be effected by a registered instrument signed by or on
behalf of the donor, and attested by at least two witnesses.......".
40.5. Clearly, in terms of Section 123 of Transfer of Property Act, gift of an immovable property
could be effected only by a registered instrument signed by or on behalf of the donor, and attested
by at least two witnesses.
40.6 The argument, thus, raised before the Court by the appellant, that is, the adopted son of
Vaithilingam Pillai, was that since the adoption deed was executed prior to the registration of the
gift deed i.e., prior to the completion of the gift, in law, it could not take effect. In other words, the
argument was if the donor dies or revokes or becomes incapable of making the gift before its
registration, it cannot W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 36 take effect. The respondents before the Court,
however, relied upon Section 47 of the Act. The Court made the following apposite observations: -
"7. The learned Chief Justice in the Court below, after referring to the above sections,
said:
The effect of these sections in my judgment is that if a title is complete except for
registration, no subsequent alienation or dealing with the property by the vendor or
donor as the case may be can defeat the title which on registration becomes an
absolute title dating from the date of the execution of the document.
8. The other two Judges concurred in this view, making special reference to the case
of Venkati Rama Reddi v. Pillati Rama, Reddi [1917] 40 Mad. 204, which, being a
decision of the Full Bench, was binding upon them. In that case the donor died on the
day following the execution of the deed of gift, and the deed was not presented for
registration until a period of six months had elapsed from the date of his death; facts
which, as it appears to their Lordships, were certainly not less cogent in favour of
incompleteness than are those in the present case; and there the District Judge held
that the gift deed, not having been registered by the donor during her lifetime, was
void, and that the post-mortem registration was of no effect. This judgment was,
however, reversed on appeal by the unanimous decision of the Full Bench.
There was no express finding of fact, so far as appears from the report, that the deed of gift had been
delivered to and accepted by the donee prior to the death of the donor, although, perhaps, this may
be implied from the circumstances. In the present case, fortunately, there is no room for doubt on
this point, because the learned Judges of the High Court remitted this question of fact to the
Subordinate Judge and he reported that the deed had been delivered over, on the day of its
execution, to one of W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 37 the trustees appointed under it on behalf of himself
and the other trustee. The decision of the Full Bench in Venkati Rama Reddi's case is thus
summarized in the head-note :-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133190430/ 21Yogesh Kumar Malik vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Anr. on 17 April, 2018
There is nothing in Section 123 of the Transfer of Property Act which requires the
donor to have the deed registered; all that is required is that he should have executed
the deed. Once such an instrument is duly executed, the Registration Act allows it to
be registered even though the donor may not agree to its registration, and upon
registration the gift takes effect from the date of execution.
9. Their Lordships think that this statement of the law needs qualification by
reference to Section 122 of the Transfer of Property Act, and is only correct upon the
footing that the gift had been accepted by or on behalf of the donee during the
lifetime of the donor. A deed of gift executed in accordance with the terms of Section
123 of immovable property but never communicated to the intended donee, and
remaining in the possession of the grantor, undelivered, would, in their Lordships'
opinion not come within the ruling of the Full Bench in the case in question.
10. The only other case to which it is necessary to refer is a Full Bench decision of the
High Court of Bombay in 1924, namely, Atmaram Sakharam v. Vaman Janardhan
AIR 1925 Bom. 210. The circumstances in that case were very much the same as in
the present, and the decision is thus correctly expressed in the head-
note :-
Where the donor of immovable property has handed over to the donee an instrument
of gift duly executed and attested, and the gift has been accepted by the donee, the
donor has no power to revoke the gift prior to the registration of the instrument.
W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 38
11. This case was very fully argued and the argument on behalf of the appellant in the
present appeal could not be better stated than it was in the dissenting judgments of
Shah Acting C.J. and Mulla J.; and these arguments were all brought very forcibly
under their Lordships' notice, and supplemented by the learned counsel for the
appellant. Their Lordships, however, cannot accept them. They are unable to see how
the provision of Section 123 of the Transfer of Property Act can be reconciled with
Section 47 of the Indian Registration Act, except upon the view that, while
registration is a necessary solemnity in order to the enforcement of a gift of
immoveable property, it does not suspend the gift until registration actually takes
place. When the instrument of gift has been handed by the donor to the donee and
accepted by him, the former has done everything in his power to complete the
donation and to make it effective.
Registration does not depend upon his consent, but is the act of an, officer appointed by law for the
purpose, who, if the deed is executed by or on behalf of the donor and is attested by at least two
witnesses, must register it if it is presented by a person having the necessary interest within the
prescribed period. Neither death, nor the express revocation by the donor, is a ground for refusing
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133190430/ 22Yogesh Kumar Malik vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Anr. on 17 April, 2018
registration, if the other conditions are complied with. Their Lordships accordingly find themselves
in complete agreement with the judgment of the Full Bench of the Bombay High Court in the case
cited. As this decision, and the similar decision of the Full Bench of the Madras High Court, had
settled the law for these Presidencies, it is unnecessary to refer to the various conflicting decisions of
inferior tribunals which were overruled. Their Lordships apprehend that the Judges of the High
Court of Madras, in allowing leave to the appellant in the present case to proceed with his appeal,
desire to elicit an authoritative opinion as to the soundness of the two latest decisions in the Madras
Courts and their Lordships think it desirable that a point which has occasioned so W.P.(C) 559/2016
Page 39 much controversy in the past should be settled by a decision, which will apply to the whole
of India."
(emphasis is mine)
41. This view was followed by the Privy Council in another judgment rendered by it in Venkatsubba
Srinivas Hegde's1 case.
42. Having regard to the array of judgments cited before me in my view, what emerge as the guiding
principles are as follows: -
(i) A registered document shall operate from the time it is intended to operate by the
parties if no registration thereof had been required in law or made, and not from the
date of its registration. Having said so, Section 47 of the 1908 Act would kick in only
upon the subject document being registered.
(ii) While registration accords necessary solemnity to the subject document for the
purpose of enforcing the rights encapsulated therein, the transfer of rights from one
party to the other, in this case from lessor to the lessee, would not remain in
suspension until registration is actually effected.
(iii) Registration of a document is not consent centric, once the document is
executed, the concerned statutory authority must register it if it is presented by the
person having interest in it in accordance with the applicable provisions of law.
1 AIR 1928 PC 86 W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 40
43. This principle ties in with Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act, which requires that in case
of lease of an immovable property, from year to year or for any term exceeding one year or reserving
an yearly rent, can only be made by a registered instrument.
43.1 Section 17(1)(d) of the 1908 Act requires such documents, provided other pre-requisites are
fulfilled, to be compulsorily registered. The effect of non-registration of such documents, that is,
documents which are required to be compulsorily registered under Section 17 or under the
provisions of Transfer of Property Act, is set out in Section 492 of the 1908 Act.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133190430/ 23Yogesh Kumar Malik vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Anr. on 17 April, 2018
2 49. Effect of non-registration of documents required to be registered.--No document required by
section 17 1[or by any provision of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of 1882)], to be registered
shall--
(a) affect any immovable property comprised therein, or
(b) confer any power to adopt, or
(c) be received as evidence of any transaction affecting such property or conferring
such power, unless it has been registered: 54 [Provided that an unregistered document affecting
immovable property and required by this Act or the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of 1882), to be
registered may be received as evidence of a contract in a suit for specific performance under Chapter
II of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 (3 of 1877) 55, 56 [***] or as evidence of any collateral transaction
not required to be effected by registered instrument.] State Amendment Uttar Pradesh: In section
49,--
(i) in the first paragraph, after the words "or by any provision of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882"
insert the words "or of any other law for the time being in force",
(ii) substitute clause (b) as under: "(b) confer any power or create any right or relationship, or",
(iii) in clause (c), after the words "such power", insert the words "or creating such right or
relationship",
(iv) in the proviso, omit the words "as evidence of a contract in a suit for specific performance under
Chapter II of the Specific Relief Act, 1877, or". [Vide Uttar Pradesh Act 57 of 1976, sec. 34 (w.e.f.
1-1-1977)].
W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 41 43.2 A perusal of the aforesaid provision would show that in the absence
of registration of lease deeds, which are the subject documents in the instant case, those documents,
in law, could not be relied upon for enforcement of rights and/ or obligations or tendered as
evidence except in circumstances adverted to in the proviso to Section 49 of 1908 Act.
43.3 This, however, would not, in law, mean that the transfer of interest, whether in a lease, gift or
sale, has not taken place inter-se the parties.
43.4 This is for the reason that the registration of documents such as sale deed, lease deed or a gift
deed is not dependent on the vendor, donor or the lessor seeking registration. If otherwise, the
document in issue meets the requirements necessary for obtaining registration, the registering
officer is duty bound to register the document. (See Kalyana Sundaram Pillai and Venkatsubba
Shrinivas Hegde(cid:129)s case).
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133190430/ 24Yogesh Kumar Malik vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Anr. on 17 April, 2018
43.5 In this behalf, sub-Section (1) of Section 75 of 1908 Act provides a clue. The said section
requires the Registrar to register the subject document if he finds that the document in issue has
been executed and the requirements thereto have been complied with. Sub- section (2) of Section 75
goes on to state that if the document is duly presented for registration within 30 days after making
of such order, that is, order under Sub-section (1) of Section 75, the Registering Officer shall obey
the same and thereupon shall, so far as may be practicable, follow the procedure prescribed in
Sections 58, 59 and 60.
W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 42 Therefore, if registration is carried out in the manner indicated above,
sub-Section (3) of Section 75, shall take effect as if the document had been registered, when, it was
first duly presented for registration.
43.6 That the date of first presentation is important from point of view of ascertaining the date of
registration can be discerned from the provisions of sub-section (4) of Section 75 which gives power
to the Registrar to summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel them to give
evidence as if he were a Civil Court for the purposes of inquiry under Section 74. An inquiry under
Section 74 would be necessary where the Registrar is required to ascertain: -
(a) Whether the subject document has been executed.
(b) The requirements of law for the time being in force have been complied with on
the part of the applicant or person presenting the document for registration, as the
case may be, so as to entitle the document to registration.
43.7 Necessarily, where inquiry is conducted, there would be a hiatus between the date of
presentation and the registration of the document in issue. It is quite possible that inquiry may
return findings which favour the person seeking registration of a document - should then the period
utilized in carrying the inquiry shift the date of registration? The answer would have to be in the
negative if one were to taken into account the provisions of Section 75(3) of the 1908 Act.
W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 43
44. Clearly, a perusal of the aforesaid provisions would show that once an order for registration has
been made, and the extant requirements of law are fulfilled, then the registration is to take effect as
if the document had been registered when it was first duly presented for registration. If this
statutory logic and rationale is not followed, it would lead to complications and at times, iniquities
which are best avoided.
44.1 The provisions of Section 60 which deals with the certificate of registration and Section 61
which requires the endorsement and certificates referred to and mentioned in Section 59 and 60, to
be copied in the margin of the register book would have to be understood in the light of provisions of
Section 75(3) of the 1908 Act. No doubt Section 47 of the 1908 Act would kick in, as indicated above,
after the completion of the registration and when, perhaps, there are competing rights of priority
qua two or more documents, section 75(3) of 1908 Act would undoubtedly come to the aid of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/133190430/ 25Yogesh Kumar Malik vs Indian Oil Corporation Limited & Anr. on 17 April, 2018
applicant in fixing the date of registration, which would be the date when the subject document was
first presented. In other words, the difference between Section 47 and 75(3) of 1908 Act, is that,
while the former fixes the date of operation of the subject document after its registration the latter,
that is, fixes the date of registration.
45. In the given case, as noted in my narration above, IOCL's own document appears to be
consistent with the aforesaid exposition of the law.

46. A close perusal of the extracts from the documents referred to above, would show
that IOCL is reading Clause 6 of the brochure without adverting to the provisions
made in the other two documents, that is, the General Instructions to the candidate
to applying for LPG, Distributorship, and in the Format for Field Verification of
Credentials of Individual Applicants for the LPG Distributor. Clearly, while the
obligation on the applicant applying for LPG Distributorship, was to place on record
a registered document, it is the date given on the document which matters and not
the date of registration. The applicant was required to ensure that the date which the
document bears is either the last date prescribed for submission of the application or
a date prior to the said date.
47. As a matter of fact, there is no requirement that the registration date should
precede the date and time prescribed for submission of application in the
advertisement issued by the IOCL. The instant case stands on a better footing as the
date of execution of subject lease deeds are not only prior to the last date prescribed
for submission of the application, but that the first presentation for registration was
also made prior to the close of office hours, albeit, on the last date prescribed for the
submission of applications. The narration of facts above would show that the subject
documents were executed on 9.10.2013. They were presented for registration to the
concerned statutory authority at 11.59.25 a.m. on 10.10.2013. Concededly, on the last
date of submission, the office hours would go beyond noon.
Thus, the application alongwith the requisite enclosures, contrary to W.P.(C) 559/2016 Page 52
what is being held in the impugned communications of IOCL, was filed prior to the cut-off date
given in the advertisement.
48. Therefore, in view of the aforesaid discussion, I am of the opinion that the writ petition would
have to be allowed. Accordingly, the impugned communications dated 02.02.2015, 18.03.2015 and
03.07.2015 are set aside. Since, the petitioner herein was the only claimant for issuance of a Letter
of Intent (LOI) in his favour qua the subject location, and there was no other impediment placed in
his way other than the legal issue discussed above, IOCL will consider issuance of an LOI in favour
of the petitioner within two weeks of receipt of the copy of this judgment. There shall, however, be
no order as to costs.
