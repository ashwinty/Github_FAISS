JUDGMENT
Y.B. Bhatt, J.
1. This is a revision under Section 29(2) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates
Control Act, 1947 at the instance of the petitioner-tenant original defendant, who was sued by the
respondent plaintiff-landlord for a decree of eviction under the provisions of the Bombay Rent Act.
2. The landlord had filed a suit for eviction of the tenant on the ground that the tenant was in arrears
of rent for more than six months, that he had failed to comply with the demand made in the
statutory notice issued under Section 12(2) of the Bombay Rent Act, and that therefore, the landlord
is entitled to a decree of eviction.
3. The defendant-tenant contested the suit and also raised a contention in the written statement as
to standard rent. It was also contended by the defendant-tenant that the suit notice is illegal, and
therefore, the suit is not maintainable. The trial Court, after appreciating the evidence on record,
dismissed the suit of the landlord dealing with the various aspects of the matter. The only aspect
which is relevant for the purpose of the present revision is that the trial Court also found that the
notice is illegal, since the same does not meet with the requirements of Section 12(2) of the Bombay
Rent Act. The trial Court also found on the facts proved on record that the tenant was ready and
willing to pay the contractual rent, which is also the standard rent.
4. Being aggrieved by the dismissal of the suit the landlord preferred an appeal. The lower appellate
Court on a reappreciation of the evidence on record set aside the judgment of the trial Court and
allowing the landlord's suit, passed a decree for eviction against the tenant. It is relevant to note at
this stage that the lower appellate Court has not dealt with the legality of the suit notice, specifically
on the point of termination of tenancy. It has, however, discussed the validity of the suit notice in
general, on other factual aspects, as to whether the tenant was in arrears of rent of more than six
months, whether the tenant has raised a dispute as to standard rent within one month of the receipt
of the notice, etc.
5. Suffice it to say that the question of validity of the suit notice has been discussed in paragraph 17
of the judgment of the lower appellate Court. In the said paragraph the lower appellate Court has
sought to rely upon decision of the Supreme Court reported at AIR 1963 SC 120, and according to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/687987/ 1Shantaben Harilal Brahmbhatt vs Hasmukhlal Maneklal Chokshi on 12 January, 2001
the lower appellate Court, "there is no need to terminate the tenancy in the case of statutory tenancy
when the suit is filed for recovery of possession on the ground of arrears of rent". The lower
appellate Court then proceeded to apply the principle laid down by the Supreme Court in the said
decision, on the assumption that the tenant was a statutory tenant, and not a contractual tenant.
6. The distinction between a contractual tenant and a statutory tenant is well understood and dealt
with by a plethora of judicial decisions. However, in any given case, the question as to whether a
particular defendant is a contractual or a statutory tenant is a mixed question of fact and law, and in
case there is any controversy, this is required to be pleaded and proved by the party who sets up the
contention. In the instant case, the landlord has from the very inception of the controversy, starting
from the statutory notice at Exh. 16, treated the defendant-tenant as a contractual tenant. The
defendant on his part has not set up any contrary plea that he is a statutory tenant. Thus, in absence
of any controversy, the Court could only have proceeded on the basis that the relationship between
the parties was that of a contractual tenant. It was both unjustified and unwarranted on the part of
the lower appellate Court to proceed on the assumption that the defendant-tenant was a statutory
tenant.
7. It may be noted here that I do not propose to deal with other incidental and factual controversies
in the matter inasmuch as the jurisdiction of this Court in a revision under Section 29(2) is limited.
This Court can only examine substantial questions of law, and would be justified in interfering only
where it is found that the illegality committed by the lower appellate Court is of such a nature as
would hit a fundamental question, such as the jurisdiction of the Court. In the instant case, I find
that the question of the validity of the suit notice has been examined by the lower appellate Court in
a most casual manner and without application of mind. It has, furthermore, misconstrued the
decision of the Supreme Court (referred to hereinabove) and has misinterpreted the same by
applying the principle laid down therein in favour of the landlord. As discussed hereinafter the said
decision leads to an entirely different conclusion.
8. The principal contentions raised by learned Counsel for the petitioner-tenant challenge the
legality and validity of the suit notice on a number of grounds. It is contended that the suit notice at
Exh. 16 is invalid since (i) it does not terminate the tenancy i.e., it does not bring an end to the
contractual relationship between the landlord and the tenant, (ii) it does not give 30 days time to the
tenant to pay up the demand made in the said notice, and (iii) the demand made in the notice is in
respect of monthly rent which exceeds the contractual rent.
8.1 In the context of the grounds of challenge to the legality and validity of the statutory notice,
learned Counsel for the respondent-landlord contended that fresh grounds could not be urged in
revision. In my opinion, this contention cannot be sustained since the legality and validity of the
notice was challenged even before the trial Court and has been dealt with by the trial Court in favour
of the tenant. Even the lower appellate Court was addressed on this issue and that Court has also
dealt with the same. Thus, the mere fact that additional grounds have been raised in this revision on
an issue on which the parties were ad diem before the two Courts below would not amount to raising
a fresh point in revision. This is particularly so since the additional grounds raised in this revision
do not require any additional evidence and do not involve anything except a question of law which
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/687987/ 2Shantaben Harilal Brahmbhatt vs Hasmukhlal Maneklal Chokshi on 12 January, 2001
can be decided on a mere interpretation of the suit notice which is already on record.
9. I have carefully perused the suit notice at Exh. 16 dated 11th June 1984, and have heard the
learned Counsel for the respective parties on the interpretation of the contents thereof.
9.1 On a plain reading of the said notice it becomes apparent that the suit notice does not terminate
the tenancy of the tenant. Learned Counsel for the landlord does not dispute this position. The suit
notice also does not grant the tenant one month's time to meet with the mandatory demand made in
the suit notice. Again there is no controversy on this aspect.
9.2 There is also no controversy that the demand made by the landlord is at the rate of Rs. 16/- per
month, whereas the concurrent findings of the two Courts below establish that the contractual rent
payable by the tenant was Rs. 11/- per month. Thus, the demand made in the suit notice is in respect
of an amount which exceeds the contractual rent.
10. The only question, therefore, which requires to be considered is whether such a notice could be
said to be a valid notice within the meaning of Section 12(2) of the Bombay Rent Act.
11. In the case of Abdulgani v. Chimanlal Maneklal, decided by a Division Bench of this Court and
reported at 1979 GLR 107, it has been clearly laid down and explained inter alia that a valid notice
under Section 12(2) is required to be served in the manner provided in Section 106 of the Transfer of
Property Act, but does not exclude the termination of tenancy as one of the requirements. It is,
therefore, necessary for the landlord not only to terminate the tenancy, but also to give the tenant
one month's time to pay the arrears of rent. The relevant portion of the judgment in para 3 thereof
reads as under :
"What sub-section (2) of Section 12 provides is that a notice of demand contemplated
by sub-section (2) shall be served in the manner provided in Section 106 of the
Transfer of Property Act, 1882. It does not lay down that the statutory notice under
Sec.
106 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, terminating the tenancy of the tenant need
not be given or that it is not necessary. Sub-section (2) of Section 12 does not open
with any non obstante clause and does not provide that notwithstanding anything
contained in Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, a landlord shall be
entitled to file a suit for possession only upon serving the notice of demand of arrears
of rent upon the tenant. Sub-section (2) of Section 12 affords an additional protection
to the tenant inasmuch as where a tenant has fallen into arrears of rent and the
landlord seeks to recover possession of the premises on that ground from him, it is
necessary for the landlord to serve upon him notice of demand and give him one
month's time to pay the arrears of rent besides terminating his tenancy under Section
106 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. By no canon of construction it can ever be
said that sub-section (2) of Section 12 dispenses with the statutory notice required to
be served by the landlord upon his tenant under Section 106 of the T. P. Act before he
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/687987/ 3Shantaben Harilal Brahmbhatt vs Hasmukhlal Maneklal Chokshi on 12 January, 2001
seeks to recover possession of the premises from the tenant. We have no doubt in our
mind that a suit by a landlord to recover possession of the suit premises from his
tenant must be preceded by two valid notices, one under Section 106 of the Transfer
of Property Act, 1882, and another notice of demand under sub-section (2) of Section
12. They may be incorporated in one document. Therefore, the finding recorded by
the learned Judge that it was not necessary for the plaintiff to serve upon the
defendant statutory notice as required by Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act,
1882, cannot be sustained and, is therefore, set aside.
The said decision while dealing with the nature and character of the notice under
Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act (which would also apply to the notice
under Section 12(2) of the Bombay Rent Act as discussed in the decision referred to
above), found that where the notice to quit, besides terminating the tenancy
according to the month of tenancy, mentioned two additional dates on which the
tenant if he so chose, could determine the tenancy, only gave an option to the tenant
to apply such date of termination of tenancy as the tenant may consider appropriate
on the facts of the case. This did not have effect of invalidating the notice on the
ground of vagueness or uncertainty. However, the substance of the decision goes to
indicate that the termination of the tenancy was one of the fundamentals before a suit
for possession could be filed.
12. As observed hereinabove, the lower appellate Court has completely misconstrued the
observations of the Supreme Court in the case of Punjalal v. Bhagwatiprasad, reported at AIR 1963
SC 120. This decision by a three Judges Bench extensively deals with the principles of determination
of tenancy, and also a suit for recovery of possession under the Bombay Rent Act based upon the
statutory notice issued under Section 12 of the Bombay Rent Act. This decision unequivocally lays
down the principle that Section 12 operates against the landlord only after the contractual tenancy is
determined in accordance with Section 111 of the Transfer of Property Act, and that the suit for
recovery of possession under Section 12 of the Bombay Rent Act would not be maintainable unless
the tenancy is determined and a notice under Section 12(2) is served. Obviously, Section 12(2) in
itself does not explicitly contemplate the termination of tenancy. However, as this decision clearly
lays down, a suit would be maintainable [on the foundation of Section 12(2) only if that notice or any
other notice has determined the tenancy. The basic principle is that without determination of the
tenancy no suit for eviction is maintainable. As observed hereinabove, the notice at Exh. 16 is the
only notice given by the landlord to the tenant, and although the said notice does not contain any
averment that it is a statutory notice under Section 12(2) of the Act, learned counsel for the
respondent tenant has no option but to rely upon it as if it were a statutory notice under Section
12(2) of the Bombay Rent Act. Since, it is relied upon as the statuary notice under Section 12(2), and
admittedly no other notice determining the tenancy has been issued or served, it is this notice at
Exh. 16 which must pass all the tests before it can be said that it is a valid notice under Section 12(2)
of the said Act.
12.1 Learned Counsel for the respondent-landlord sought to rely upon a decision of the Supreme
Court in the case of V. Dhanapal Chettiar v. Yesodai Ammal, reported at AIR 1979 SC 1745. This
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/687987/ 4Shantaben Harilal Brahmbhatt vs Hasmukhlal Maneklal Chokshi on 12 January, 2001
decision has been considered and discussed at length by learned Counsel for the
respondent-landlord. According to him this decision lays down the principle that a notice of
termination of tenancy need not be issued under Section 106 or Section 111 of the Transfer of
Property Act for the purpose of eviction suit against the tenant under any State Rent Control Act. In
my opinion, this decision does not lay down any such proposition in such broad terms as canvassed
by learned Counsel for the landlord. In para 6 of the said decision the Supreme Court had occasion
to observe that : "Only in those State Acts where a specific provision has been made for the giving of
any notice requiring the tenant either to pay the arrears of rent within the specified period or to do
any other thing, such as the Bombay Rent Act or the West Bengal Rent Act, no notice in accordance
with Clause (g) is necessary." In other words, the general proposition is qualified by the observation
that certain State Acts require a statutory notice as a foundation for a suit for eviction, and in those
cases, including the Bombay Rent Act, the conditions set out must be satisfied. Thus, the conditions
necessary for a notice to meet the requirements of Section 12(2) of the Bombay Rent Act have to be
considered in the light of this specific provision, and these essential requirements have been
discussed by a number of decisions of this Court including the case of Abdulgani v. Chimanlal
Maneklal (supra), and including the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Punjalal v.
Bhagawatiprasad (supra). In paragraph 9 of the said decision the Supreme Court had occasion to
observe that : "It will bear repetition to say that under the Transfer of Property Act in order to entitle
the landlord to recover possession determination of the lease is necessary as during its continuance
he could not recover possession, while under the State Rent Act the landlord becomes entitled to
recover possession only on the fulfilment of the rigour of law provided therein. Otherwise not. He
cannot recover possession merely by determination of tenancy. Nor can he be stopped from doing so
on the ground that he has not terminated the contractual tenancy." The crux of the matter is that a
condition precedent to the filing of a suit for eviction (on the ground of arrears) is the issuance and
service of a statutory notice, 12.2 The summary of the conclusions drawn by the Supreme Court, are
found in the latter part of paragraph 18 of the said decision, which reads as under :
"... But on the first assumption we have taken a different view of the matter and have
come to the conclusion that determination of a lease in accordance with the Transfer
of Property Act is unnecessary and a mere surplusage because the landlord cannot
get eviction of the tenant even after such determination. The tenant continues to be
so, even thereafter. That being so, making out a case under the Rent Act tor eviction
of the tenant by itself is sufficient and it is not obligatory to found the proceeding on
the basis of the determination of the lease by issue of notice in accordance with
Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act."
In my opinion, the sum and substance of the decision is that the determination of the lease is
unnecessary, (since it is considered to be superfluous by the Supreme Court), in accordance with
Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, if terminated according to the State Act. The crucial
distinction in the instant case is that Section 12(2) of the Bombay Rent Act does not contemplate
determination of the lease in accordance with Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. It merely
contemplates that the notice issued under Section 12(2) must be served in accordance with Section
106 of the Transfer of Property Act. In my opinion, therefore, this decision cannot be read so as to
mean that the statutory notice under Section 12(2) of the Bombay Rent Act does not contemplate
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/687987/ 5Shantaben Harilal Brahmbhatt vs Hasmukhlal Maneklal Chokshi on 12 January, 2001
the termination of tenancy under any law, or even under the Rent Act. It also requires to be noted
that the Transfer of Property Act is a Central Act, whereas the Bombay Rent Act is a State Act. In any
concurrent field of legislation, the provisions of a State Act cannot override the provisions of a
Central Act, in case of conflict or inconsistency. Thus, the termination of tenancy under the Transfer
of Property Act can only be considered superfluous if such termination of tenancy is necessary under
any State Act. This presupposes that the State Act contemplates termination of tenancy, otherwise
there is no redundancy. As already observed hereinabove. Section 12(2) of the Bombay Rent Act
does not contemplate a notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, but only service in
the manner laid down in Section 106. If this interpretation of the landlord in respect of this decision
were to be accepted, it would mean that no termination of tenancy is necessary, neither under the
Transfer of Property Act nor under the Bombay Rent Act. Such an interpretation of this decision is
just not possible.
12.3 It may be noted here that the learned Counsel for the respondent-landlord conceded that if the
relationship of the landlord and tenant were not governed by the Bombay Rent Act, but were
governed by the Transfer of Property Act, no suit would lie for eviction unless the tenancy was
terminated under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. Since admittedly the relations are
governed by the Bombay Rent Act, it does not ipso facto follow that since a notice under Section 106
of the Transfer of Property Act is not a condition precedent for an eviction suit under Section 12(2),
the same is also superfluous or redundant under the Bombay Rent Act.
12.4 Even otherwise, even if the view canvassed by the learned Counsel for the landlord on the
interpretation of the aforesaid decision is accepted, the statutory notice in the instant case is
vulnerable on other grounds as well.
13. Learned Counsel for the respondent-landlord sought to rely upon a decision of the Supreme
Court in the case of N. M. Engineer v. Narendra Singh Virdi, reported at 1994 (5) SCC 261. As a
result of a discussion on this decision, it is apparent that the same does not lay down any principle
which would be of utility to learned Counsel for the landlord.
13.1 In paragraph 15 of this decision, an earlier decision is referred to viz., the case of Chimanlal v.
Mishrilal, [1985 (1) SCC 14]. Referring to that decision the Supreme Court has quoted from para 8
thereof as under :
"The notice referred to in Section 12(1)(a) must be a notice demanding the rental
arrears in respect of accommodation actually let to the tenant. It must be a notice (a)
demanding the arrears of rent in respect of the accommodation let to the tenant and
(b) the arrears of rent must be legally recoverable from the tenant. There can be no
admission by a tenant that arrears of rent are due unless they relate to the
accommodation let to him. A valid notice demanding arrears of rent relatable to the
accommodation let to the tenant from which he is sought to be evicted is a vital
ingredient of the conditions, which govern the maintainability of the suit, for unless a
valid demand is made no complaint can be laid of non-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/687987/ 6Shantaben Harilal Brahmbhatt vs Hasmukhlal Maneklal Chokshi on 12 January, 2001
compliance with it, and consequently no suit tor ejectment of the tenant in respect of
the accommodation will lie on that ground."
It, therefore, goes without saying that in order to enable the landlord to make a justifiable grievance
as to non-compliance with the statutory notice, the demand made therein itself must be justifiable
and valid. The question is not of strict legality of the demand, but the broad viability and
justifiability. As observed hereinabove, it is not that the demand is invalid because it exceeds the
standard rent. It is obvious that the standard rent is determined by the Court during the course of
proceedings of the eviction suit (at least on the facts of the present case) and, that therefore, the
landlord could not be placed in a position where he could be asked to restrict his demand to
standard rent. However, the landlord could only make the highest justifiable demand which would
be the contractual rent. Any demand higher than the contractual rent would certainly be
unjustifiable and invalid. As found on the facts of the case the demand made in the suit notice is
certainly higher than the contractual rent, and it is for this reason that the suit notice in the instant
case does not meet the test of its validity.
13.2 It further requires to be noted that the suit notice in the instant case at Exh. 16 on the face of it
does not grant any particular period to the tenant to meet the demand. It is an open-ended demand.
It is not being suggested that a minimum period of time must be given to the tenant to meet the
demand. However, if it is found that the landlord has merely demanded the specified arrears of rent
without specifying an outer lime-limit for compliance with the demand, it could very well be urged
that the tenant could meet with the demand as and when he chooses to do so or as and when it is
convenient for him to meet the demand. In my opinion, such a demand would not confer any cause
of action under Section 12(2) of the Bombay Rent Act. To meet with this contention learned counsel
for the respondent-landlord sought to urge that the suit notice at Exh. 16 is also being capable of
interpreted so as to mean that it makes an instant demand of payment of arrears. Firstly, in my
opinion, the suit notice is not being capable of such interpretation. Secondly, even if such an
interpretation were possible, it would fall foul of the Division Bench decision of this Court in the
case of Abdulgani v. Chimanlal Maneklal (supra). Therefore, this contention on behalf of the
landlord is of no avail.
13.3 Learned Counsel for the respondent-landlord sought to rely upon a decision of the Supreme
Court in the case of Joshi Bhuraram Datlaram v. Jivibai D. Mulchand, reported at 1995 Supp (3)
SCC 416, and particularly the observations in paragraph 4 thereof. It must be appreciated that this
decision mainly deals with a dispute as to the demand made by the landlord as to the standard rent
applicable to the premises, and it was in this context that the Supreme Court held that : "Rate of
standard rent mentioned in the notice under Section 12(2) of the Bombay Rent Act not challenged
under Section 11(3) - held - could not be challenged in the written statement in the eviction suit
under Section 12(1)". The Supreme Court while dealing with the contention (in para 4 of the said
decision) negatived the contention of the tenant that since the standard rent was only Rs. 9/-, the
tenant was not liable to be ejected on the basis of a notice under Section 12(2) which demanded
arrears at the rate of Rs. 20/- per month. In my opinion, this decision would be of no assistance to
the landlord for the simple reason that the controversy in this case is entirely on different facts. The
tenant does not assert that the notice is invalid because the demand exceeds the standard rent
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/687987/ 7Shantaben Harilal Brahmbhatt vs Hasmukhlal Maneklal Chokshi on 12 January, 2001
(although the dispute as to standard rent was in fact raised in the written statement). The dispute is
only to the extent that when the demand made in the suit notice exceeds the contractual rent, such
an invalid demand would not lay the foundation or furnish any cause of action to the landlord for
filing a suit for eviction. On the facts of the case both the Courts have found that the standard rent is
the same as the contractual rent and that the demand made in the suit notice exceeds the
contractual rent. On [his ground, therefore it must be found that where the demand in the suit
notice is not justifiable on any ground, the same cannot be said to be a valid demand and therefore
such a demand would not meet the test laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of N. M.
Engineer v. Narendra Singh Virdi (supra).
13.4 Learned Counsel for the respondent-landlord also sought to rely upon a decision of this Court
in the case of Shah Ashokkumar Manilal v. Gandhi Vrajilal Gabrrulal Deesa, reported at AIR 1995
Guj. 161. In my opinion, this decision would be of no assistance to the landlord since it is on an
entirely different issue altogether. This decision lays down that the statutory notice under Section 12
must contain a demand of the arrears which must be precise and not vague, but found (on the facts
of the case) that where the notice clearly specifies the date from which the rent was due, it could not
be said to be a demand which is vague and imprecise particularly where the tenant has not pleaded
that he was misled by the amount set out in the notice. It was under those circumstances that the
notice was found to be valid. In the instant case, it is not the vagueness of the demand on which the
validity of the suit notice is questioned.
13.5 Learned Counsel for the respondent-landlord also sought to rely upon a decision of this Court
in the case of Labhabhai v. Laxmidas, reported at 1963 GLR 567. In this decision the principle has
been laid down to the effect that when a notice under Section 12(2) of the Bombay Rent Act makes a
demand in respect of the arrears of rent, not at the rate of contractual rent, but a rate higher than
the standard rent, the notice itself does not become invalid so as to take away the right of the
landlord to institute the suit on the basis of the suit notice. The entire basis of this decision is based
on the interpretation of Section 7 of the Act, whereby it is found that the recovery of rent in excess of
standard rent and permitted increases is illegal. The Court found that it is the recovery in excess of
standard rent which is illegal, and merely because the demand is made in excess of the standard rent
would not make the notice illegal. It is obvious as noted by the Court in the said decision itself, that
the dispute as to standard rent can arise only after the tenant receives the notice under Section
12(2), (in most of the cases). It is, therefore, neither reasonable, nor an obligation cast upon the
landlord by statute that he must first assess or obtain a determination through the Court as to what
the standard rent is or should be, and then issue a statutory notice. It was under those
circumstances that the Court held that merely because the demand made in the statutory notice is
ultimately found to be higher than the standard rent which is later on determined by the Court,
would not affect the validity of the suit notice. In my opinion, this decision has no application to the
facts of the case inasmuch as this is not the controversy in the instant case. Here the suit notice is
challenged only on the ground that the demand is in excess of the contractual rent, and is therefore a
demand which is neither tenable nor legal nor justifiable, even on the date when the demand is
issued.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/687987/ 8Shantaben Harilal Brahmbhatt vs Hasmukhlal Maneklal Chokshi on 12 January, 2001
14. It is, therefore, obvious that the suit notice is invalid for a number of reasons. In my opinion, it is
invalid because it docs not terminate the tenancy of the tenant. However, even if it is considered not
to be invalid on this ground, there are other infirmities which cannot make it valid. It is also invalid
because the said notice does not specify the outer limit of compliance with the demand, and in fact
no period is prescribed at all for compliance, and therefore, the landlord could not complain in the
suit that the demand made by him has not been met. Under the circumstances, this would not
confer any cause of action upon the landlord to file the suit for eviction. Lastly, it is invalid because
it makes a demand in respect of rent which is not recoverable nor justifiable i.e. the demand is at the
rate which is in excess of the contractual rent.
15. In the premises aforesaid, the statutory notice at Exh. 16 does not meet the requirements of
Section 12(2) of the Bombay Rent Act, as explained by the number of decisions referred to
hereinabove and the same is therefore incapable of conferring any cause of action upon the landlord.
Consequently, in the absence of a legal and valid notice under Section 12(2) of the Bombay Rent Act,
the Rent Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain and decide the suit. The suit of the landlord, therefore,
must fail. Consequently, it must be found that the judgment and decree of the lower appellate Court
are illegal, contrary to law, and are therefore, required to be quashed and set aside. It is so held and
directed.
16. Accordingly, this revision is allowed. Rule is made absolute with costs throughout.
17. Application allowed.
