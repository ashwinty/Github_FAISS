refusal of the Hirer/its men or obstruction or delay in handing over to the company the physical
possession of the Hired Article together with all specified relevant documents/certificates under
these circumstances shall be deemed to be an unlawful detention and wrongful possession of the
property by the Hirer and an offence within the purview of the provisions of the Indian Penal Code.
5. It is not in dispute that the Complainant defaulted in payment of instalments. Even though the
Complainant was required to pay the first instalment within 1st August, 2002 and the subsequent
instalments within the 1st of each succeeding month, the Complainant did not adhere to the
schedule of repayments, which according to the Financier, was of essence to the hire-purchase
agreement. Post dated cheques deposited by the Complainant were, according to the Financier,
dishonoured.
6. In the circumstances, the Financier took re-possession of the vehicle on 14th July, 2003, allegedly
upon notice to the Complainant, and in accordance with the conditions of the hire-purchase
agreement. The factum of notice is, however, disputed by the Complainant.
7. After taking re-possession of the vehicle, the Financier called upon the Complainant to clear his
outstanding dues amounting to Rs.2,80,132.59 as on the date of the notice, failing which the vehicle
would be disposed of.
8. A pre sale legal notice dated 26.07.2003 was allegedly sent by the Financier to the Complainant,
calling upon him to clear his total outstanding dues of Rs.2,80,132.59 within 7 days from the date of
receipt of the notice, which was, according to the Financier, duly served on the Complainant. The
Complainant did not make the repayment demanded, or even part thereof. The vehicle was sold by
the Financier sometime in November, 2003.
9. On or about 15th July, 2005, that is, exactly two years after the Financier took possession of the
vehicle, the Complainant filed the complaint under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986,
being Complaint No.105 of 2005 in the District Forum, admitting that he had paid only 7 complete
instalments. For the sake of convenience, the relevant paragraphs of the complaint are extracted
hereinbelow:

10. As admitted by the Complainant in Paragraph (4) of his complaint, the Complainant had
received possession of the vehicle from the dealer on 29.7.2002. It is the case of the Complainant in
his complaint at Paragraph (7) that the Financier had “lifted the vehicle” on 14.07.2003 without any
prior notice or information. The vehicle was taken away by the Financier on 14.7.2003, almost a
year after the Complainant received possession of the vehicle. Twelve instalments were payable
within 14.07.2003, but the Complainant had, on his own admission in Paragraph (6) of the
complaint, paid only 7 complete instalments.
11. According to the Complainant, he could not pay instalments after the 7th, timely, due to his
illness. Later, an accident case was registered against the vehicle, which was detained by the Police.
After the Complainant got the vehicle released from the police and started plying the vehicle, the
Financier took repossession of the vehicle. According to the Complainant he paid Rs.1,19,335/-
towards instalments. It is not the case of the Complainant in his complaint, that the Financier took
forcible possession of the vehicle through so called recovery agents, by threat or by use of muscle
power.
12. The Complainant has alleged that, even though, the Complainant had deposited Rs.1,19,335/-
towards instalments, the Financier took possession of the vehicle without notice. The Complainant
has also alleged that the Financier refused to concede to the request of the Complainant to release
the vehicle, even though the Complainant had sought the opportunity to clear the outstanding
instalments, and pay future instalments within time. [Paragraphs (8) and (11) of the complaint].
13. The vehicle was sold in November 2003. Till then, the Complainant did not even clear the
instalments outstanding upto July 2003, that is, the outstanding instalments for the period during
which the vehicle was in the possession of the Complainant, not to speak of any further instalments.
14. By an order dated 22nd August 2008, the District Forum allowed the Complaint and directed the
Financier to pay Rs.2,23,335/- to the Complainant, along with simple interest at 10% per annum
from the date of filing of the complaint till payment as also Rs.10,000 towards damages for physical
and mental agony and Rs.1000/- as litigation expenses, within 45 days from the date of the order.
15. Being aggrieved by the order of the District Forum allowing the complaint, and directing the
Financier to pay the Complainant the entire amount paid by the Complainant to the Financier
towards instalments and other charges as well as the sum of Rs.1,04,000/- paid by the Complainant
directly to the dealer, along with interest at 10% per annum, damages of Rs.10,000/- and litigation
costs of Rs.1,000/-, the Financier filed an appeal before the State Commission. The Financier
contended that the vehicle had to be sold since the complainant had not paid an outstanding
amount of Rs.2,80,132/-.
16. By a judgment and order dated 31 st August, 2017, the State Commission dismissed the appeal.
The Financier filed a Revisional Application before the National Commission, under Section 21(b) of
the Consumer Protection Act, which has been dismissed by the judgment and order under appeal.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/129687430/ 9M/S Magma Fincorp Ltd. (Formerly ... vs Rajesh Kumar Tiwari on 1 October, 2020
17. The Financier has contended that possession of the vehicle had been taken by the Financier upon
notice to the Complainant. However, the fact finding fora under the Consumer Protection Act 1986
have concurrently found that the notice had not been sent to the address as mentioned in the Hire
Purchase Agreement, and accordingly held that notice had not been served on the complainant. The
relevant portion of the order of the National Commission under appeal is set out hereinbelow:
“The State Commission has affirmed the order passed by the District Forum on the
finding that the address of the Respondent/complainant, as mentioned in the Hire
Purchase Agreement, is “Village Rammanpur, Post-Bangaon Dehwa, Akbarpur,
Ambedkar Nagar” whereas the notice for repossessing the vehicle was sent to him at
“Rampur Bangadon, Akbarpur, Ambedkar Nagar, which is not the correct address of
the complainant and, therefore, the notice for repossession was held to have not been
served on the complainant, as a result of which the petitioner did not been served on
the complainant, as a result of which the petitioner did not have any right to
repossess the vehicle and put it to auction.
That being the finding, which could not be controverted by the Learned Counsel for
the petitioner even before us, we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned
order.
Accordingly, the revision petition fails and is dismissed in limine.”
18. The short question raised by the Financier in this appeal is, whether the Financier is the real
owner of the vehicle which is the subject of a hire purchase agreement, and if so, whether there can
be any impediment to the Financier, taking repossession of the vehicle, when the hirer does not
make payment of instalments in terms of the hire purchase agreement.
19. Another question which arises for determination in this appeal is, whether service of proper
notice on the hirer is necessary for repossession of a vehicle which is the subject of a hire purchase
agreement, and if so, what is the consequence of non service of proper notice.
20. Before dealing with the aforesaid questions involved, in this appeal, it may be pertinent to refer
to the relevant provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, set out hereinafter for convenience.
21. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 has been enacted to protect the interests of consumers, by
making provisions for the establishment of Consumer Councils and other fora for speedy redressal
of consumer disputes and for matters connected therewith. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 as
per its Statement of Objects and Reasons placed before Parliament, has been enacted to promote

further that no appeal by a person, who is required to pay any amount in terms of an order of the
District Forum, shall be entertained by the State Commission unless the appellant has deposited in

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/129687430/ 19M/S Magma Fincorp Ltd. (Formerly ... vs Rajesh Kumar Tiwari on 1 October, 2020
(a) …...
(b) to call for the records and pass appropriate orders in any consumer dispute which is pending
before or has been decided by any State Commission where it appears to the National Commission

exercise a jurisdiction so vested, or has acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with

24. Section 11 of the Consumer Protection Act confers jurisdiction on the District Forum, having
territorial jurisdiction, to entertain a complaint, subject to the pecuniary limit of the value of the
goods or services and/or the compensation claimed. In this case the territorial or the pecuniary
jurisdiction of the District Forum, to entertain the complaint, is not in dispute. There can also be no
dispute that the Complainant was a consumer of services provided by the Financier. The question is
whether the complaint filed by the Complainant is a ‘complaint’ within the meaning of Section 11,
read with Section 2(1)
(c) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. In other words, do the ingredients of a complaint as
provided in Sections 2(1)(c) (ii), (iv), (v) and (vi) of the Consumer Protection Act exist in this case?
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/129687430/ 20M/S Magma Fincorp Ltd. (Formerly ... vs Rajesh Kumar Tiwari on 1 October, 2020
Is there any deficiency in the services availed by the Complainant from the Financier, within the
meaning of Section 2(1)(g) of the Consumer Protection Act 1986? Has the Financier, as service
provider adopted any unfair trade practice within the meaning of Section 2(1)(r) of the said Act?
25. Section (2)(1)(r) defines “unfair trade practice” to mean a trade practice, for the purpose of
promoting provision of any service, by adoption of unfair method or unfair or deceptive practice,
including any of the practices enumerated in Sections 2(1)(r)(i) to (x), 2(r)(2), 2(r)(3) and 2(r)(3A).
The complaint does not make out any case of unfair trade practice within the meaning of Section
2(1)(r) of the Consumer Protection Act 1986.
26. The Complainant has only made a vague assertion that the action of the Financier in taking
possession of the vehicle, admittedly for default in payment of instalments, and in not releasing the
vehicle to the Complainant, in spite of the Complainant’s assurance to the Financier to clear
outstanding instalments and pay future instalments timely, amounts to an act of unfair trade
practice and constitutes deficiency of service.
27. As observed above, deficiency has been defined in Section 2(1)(g) set out herein above, as any
fault, imperfection or shortcoming or inadequacy in the quality, nature or manner of performance
which is required to be maintained by or under any law, for the time being in force, or undertaken to
be performed by a person, in pursuance of a contract or otherwise, in relation to any service.
28. Under the terms and conditions of the hire purchase agreement, the ownership of the vehicle
was to stand transferred to the Complainant from the Financier, upon payment of all the 35
instalments and other dues, if any. Until then, the ownership was to be with the Financier. As all the
35 instalments had not been paid by the complainant to the Financier, the ownership of the vehicle
remained with the Financier.
29. The hire purchase agreement, a copy of which is annexed to the Paper Book, clearly enabled the
Financier to take possession of the vehicle, on default in payment of any of the instalments. There is
no term in the Hire Purchase Agreement, that requires the Financier to give notice to the
Complainant before terminating the Hire Purchase Agreement, upon breach of any term thereof, or
before taking possession of the vehicle.
30. On the other hand, clause 15 of the Hire Purchase Agreement expressly provides for
determination of the Hire Purchase Agreement without notice to the Complainant, upon default in
hire instalments. Clause 15 enables the Financier and/or its agent to enter the premises of the
Complainant, where the vehicle under hire may be lying, and to take possession of the same.
31. The repossession of a vehicle under hire, in accordance with the terms and conditions of a hire
purchase agreement, upon default in payment of hire instalments and refusal to release the same on
mere assurance of the Complainant to clear outstanding arrears of hire instalments, and pay future
instalments in time, does not constitute ‘deficiency’ in service.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/129687430/ 21M/S Magma Fincorp Ltd. (Formerly ... vs Rajesh Kumar Tiwari on 1 October, 2020
32. The Financier has claimed to have issued notice to the Complainant before taking possession of
the vehicle and also a pre sale notice. Unfortunately there was an error in the address of the
Complainant in the notice purported to be issued to the Complainant before taking possession. It
may thus, reasonably be assumed that an obligation to give notice to the Complainant was implicit
in the Hire Purchase Agreement. The Financier also construed the Hire Purchase Agreement to
contain an implicit requirement to give notice to a hirer before taking possession of the vehicle
covered by the Hire Purchase Agreement.
33. The question which follows is, whether the Financier could have been directed to return the
entire amount paid by the Complainant, by way of instalments or otherwise, including
Rs.1,04,000/- paid by the Complainant directly to the dealer, and also to pay damages of Rs.10,000
for physical and mental suffering, only because of an error in the address of the Complainant, in the
notice sent by the Financier, and that too, without even considering how the Complainant was
prejudiced by the error, when the vehicle had been taken away for non payment of hire instalments
and sold after about four months.
34. The object of a notice before taking possession of a vehicle on hire under a Hire Purchase
Agreement, is to enable the hirer, to make a written request to the Financier to revive the hire
purchase agreement in terms of Clause 12 of the said agreement, upon payment of all outstanding
dues together with damages, as might be mutually agreed upon.
35. A notice also draws the attention of the hirer to the alleged breaches of agreement on the part of
the hirer, on the basis of which, the Financier claims to be entitled to take possession. Such notice
gives the hirer an opportunity to show that the hirer had not, in fact, committed any breach of
agreement. For example, the hirer might be able to show that the Financier had erroneously omitted
to give credit to the hirer for payments made, or had not presented a cheque in its possession for
payment, even though there were sufficient funds in the concerned bank account of the hirer, to
honour the cheque.
36. Many self employed hirers, operate vehicles taken on hire, to earn a livelihood. Such vehicles are
often run over long distances. A notice ensures that the hirer is not taken by surprise and has time to
stop operating the vehicle, so that third persons using the vehicle on payment of charges are not put
to sudden inconvenience by reason of re-possession of the vehicle.
37. On the face of the averments in the Complaint, the Complainant had approached the Financier
after possession of the vehicle was taken, to be told that the Financier had taken possession of the
vehicle, as the Complainant had defaulted in payment of instalments. The Financier had not agreed
to release the vehicle, on the assurance of the Complainant to clear outstanding instalments and to
pay future instalments in time.
38. A District Forum constituted under the Consumer Protection Act, 1963, derives its power to
grant relief from Section 14 of the said Act. If the District Forum is satisfied that the allegations
contained in the complaint about the services are proved, it may direct the service provider to
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/129687430/ 22M/S Magma Fincorp Ltd. (Formerly ... vs Rajesh Kumar Tiwari on 1 October, 2020
(i) return the charges paid by the Complainant [Section 14(1)
(c)];
(ii) to pay such amount, as may be awarded by the District Forum as compensation to the consumer
for any loss or injury suffered by the Complainant/Consumer, due to the negligence of the service
provider [Section 14(1)(d)];
(iii) to pay punitive damages in such circumstances as the District Forum deems fit [Proviso to
Section 14(1)(d)];
(iv) to remove the deficiencies in the service in question.
[Section 14(1)(a)];
(v) to discontinue the unfair trade practice [Section 14(1)
(f)]
39. Before a District Forum can grant relief to the consumer of a service, it has to be satisfied that
the allegations in the complaint, and/or in other words, the allegations which constitute a valid
complaint, that is allegations of unfair or restrictive trade practice adopted by the service provider,
or the allegations of deficiency in the service hired, or availed of or agreed to be availed of by the
Complainant from the service provider, or the allegations of the service provider charging a price in
excess of the price fixed for the service, under any law, for the time being in force or agreed between
the parties or allegations of offering spurious services or services hazardous to life or safety, are
proved.
40. Section 13(2)(b) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 casts an obligation on the District Forum
to decide a complaint on the basis of the evidence brought to its notice by the Complainant and the
service provider. Irrespective of whether the service provider adduces evidence or not, the decision
of the District Forum has to be based on evidence relied upon by the Complainant. The onus of
proof is on the Complainant making the allegation. Section 27 of the Consumer Protection Act casts
an obligation on the District Forum, the State Commission or the National Commission to dismiss
frivolous complaints with costs not exceeding Rs.10,000/-.
41. The evidence to which the Complainant drew the attention of the District Forum is apparent
from its judgment and order. The Complainant produced a delivery receipt in respect of the vehicle,
some payment receipts, Insurance papers in respect of the vehicle, an FIR unconnected with the
Financier and/or copies thereof and some documents relating to the filing of the Complaint and
payment of Court Fees etc., none of which establish any deficiency of service or unfair trade practice
on the part of the Financier.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/129687430/ 23M/S Magma Fincorp Ltd. (Formerly ... vs Rajesh Kumar Tiwari on 1 October, 2020
42. The District Forum drew adverse inference against the Financier for not producing the Hire
Purchase Agreement and assumed that there was no provision in the Hire Purchase Agreement for
taking the vehicle back or selling it to a third party. Significantly it was not even the case of the
Complainant in his complaint, that the Hire Purchase Agreement, which the complainant had
signed, did not authorize the Financier to take possession of the vehicle upon default, or to sell the
same to a third party.
43. No adverse inference could have been drawn against the Financier for not producing the Hire
Purchase Agreement before the District Forum, when there was no allegation in the complaint of
breach by the Financier of the Hire Purchase Agreement, in taking possession of the vehicle. The
District Forum did not exercise its power under Section 13(4)(ii) to call upon the Financier to
produce the Hire Purchase Agreement. Even otherwise, the District Forum did not direct the
Financier to produce the Hire Purchase Agreement.
44. In the Complaint, a copy of which is annexed to the Paper Book, there is not a whisper of
application of any force in taking possession of the vehicle. The finding of the District Forum, of the
vehicle having been lifted “forcefully” or “snatched” is, with the greatest of respect, contrary to the
Complainant’s own case made out in the Complaint, and therefore perverse. It is well settled that a
new case cannot be made out by way of evidence, when there are no pleadings to support the same.
45. The District Forum concluded that “snatching” the vehicle, without notice, was in breach of the
Hire Purchase Agreement and was ‘deficiency’ in service. The State Commission dismissed the
Appeal of the Financier on the ground of delay and also on merits, on the ground of non service of
notice at the correct address of the Complainant.
46. The State Commission assumed that the error in the address of the complainant in the notice
despatched by the Financier was deliberate, in order to sell the vehicle without the knowledge of the
Complainant. Such assumption was not based on any materials on record but patently conjectural.
The State Commission observed that the Complainant had been deprived of the opportunity to
deposit the amount, due from him to the Financier, which again is contrary to the Complainant’s
own pleadings in his complaint.
47. The State Commission further found that there was no mention of the amount due to be paid by
the Complainant to the Financier, in the Written Statement filed by the Financier before the District
Forum. There was also no mention in that written statement of when the vehicle had been sold and
the amount for which the vehicle had been sold, whether such amount was more than or less than
the amount due from the Complainant to the Financier. Observing that the silence on the part of the
Financier in not divulging anything about the sale rendered the sale ‘dubious’, the State Commission
concluded that the Financier had surreptitiously sold the vehicle, without the knowledge of the
Complainant, without notice to the Complainant, and without disclosing the details of the sale.
48. The aforesaid observation, of the sale being dubious, has been made, overlooking the terms and
conditions of the hire purchase agreement, and without considering the law governing hire purchase
agreements. The Financier remains the owner of the vehicle taken by the complainant on hire, on
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/129687430/ 24M/S Magma Fincorp Ltd. (Formerly ... vs Rajesh Kumar Tiwari on 1 October, 2020
condition of option to purchase, upon payment of all hire instalments. The hire instalments are
charges for use of the vehicle as also for the exercise of option to purchase the vehicle in future. The
Financier being the owner of the vehicle, there was no obligation on the part of the Financier, to
divulge details of the sale of that vehicle, and that too on its own, without being called upon to do so.
49. The finding of the State Commission that the Financier sold the vehicle without the knowledge
of the Complainant is contrary to the Complainant’s own case in his complaint before the District
Forum. The Complainant has in his complaint alleged that:-
(i) The Complainant contacted the office of the Financier, to be told that the vehicle
had been lifted, as instalments were due.
(ii) The Financier refused to return the vehicle on the assurance of the Complainant
to clear all the outstanding instalments and to pay instalments timely in future.
(iii) The Complainant entered into correspondence with the Financier and explained
his situation, but the vehicle was not returned.
50. The Complainant has established that there was a discrepancy and/or error in the address of the
Complainant in the notice for repossession, from which all the three fora under the Consumer
Protection Act, 1986, that is the District Forum, the State Commission and the National Commission
have concluded that possession of the vehicle was taken without notice. It was not the case of the
Complainant that the vehicle was sold without notice to or knowledge of the complainant.
51. The error and/or discrepancy in the address is minor and there are no materials on the basis of
which the State Commission concluded that the error was deliberate. The finding of the State
Commission, of the error in the address being deliberate, is unsubstantiated.
52. Be that as it may, we proceed on the basis of the concurrent factual findings of the District
Forum, the State Commission and the National Commission, that the Financier took possession of
the vehicle without notice. Since the Financier deemed it necessary to issue notice to the
complainant, and accordingly dispatched a notice, the notice should have been sent to the correct
address of the Complainant, as recorded in the Hire Purchase Agreement. The question which arises
is, whether repossession of the vehicle without proper notice, for admitted default in payment of
hire instalments, warranted the order passed by the District Forum, which has been affirmed by the
State Commission and the National Commission.
53. By directing the Financier to pay to the Complainant, the entire amount paid by the
Complainant to the Financier from the inception, as also the amount paid by the Complainant to the
dealer directly, along with interest at the rate of 10% per annum, damages of Rs.10,000/- and
litigation costs, the fora constituted under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, have given a
defaulting hirer the benefit of free use of the vehicle of the value of Rs.4,21,121/- for almost twelve
months, plus damages, oblivious to the depreciation in the value of the vehicle by reason of wear
and tear, due to use by the hirer, as also an admitted accident for which the vehicle lay seized with
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/129687430/ 25M/S Magma Fincorp Ltd. (Formerly ... vs Rajesh Kumar Tiwari on 1 October, 2020
the Police for some time.
54. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 creates fora for quick adjudication of consumer disputes.
The Act protects consumers from defective goods, deficient services, unfair or restrictive trade
practices, or spurious goods or services. The Act also protects consumers of goods and services from
being charged a price, in excess of the price fixed by or under any law in force, the price agreed
between the parties, or the price declared by the service provider or the supplier of the goods inter
alia by display, and/or representation.
55. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which creates fora for expeditious adjudication and
settlement of consumer disputes, is not in derogation of any law in existence, but in addition
thereto, as provided in Section 3 thereof. The said Act protects consumers of services from being
charged a price in excess of the price fixed for the service under any law or the price agreed between
the parties and also redressal of deficiency in the services availed by the Consumer and/or against
restrictive or unfair trade practices, and/or spurious services.
56. The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 does not override the Contract Act, 1872, and other
enactments in force, applicable to the service availed by the consumer from the service provider.
57. The protection, to which the consumer of a service is entitled under the Consumer Protection
Act, is against loss of money, by reason of being denied service, of a quality agreed upon expressly or
by necessary implication, inter alia, in view of the applicable law, for which the consumer has paid,
or has agreed to pay a consideration. The said Act also protects consumers from being overcharged
for any service obtained and/or agreed to be obtained.
58. The consumer of a service may also be entitled to damages for any loss suffered by the
consumer, by reason of denial or deficiency in service for which the consumer has paid or agreed to
pay (if the parties have agreed to deferred payment), charges and/or in other words, price for the
service. In cases of breach of contract, liquidated damages may be imposed on the party in breach, if
the agreement provides for liquidated damages, that is a fixed amount by way of damages. Where
the parties to an agreement have not agreed to liquidated damages, the party in breach of agreement
may be directed to pay unliquidated damages which are compensatory. Such compensatory
damages are not to punish the party in breach, but to compensate the party not in breach, for losses
suffered as a result of the breach.
59. Where, however, the damages caused by the breach are severe and extensive, the party in breach
may be required to pay to the party not in breach, such damages as would restore the position of the
party not in breach, to the position before the breach occurred.
60. Apart from compensatory damages, an Adjudicating Authority may impose on the party in
breach, punitive damages or nominal damages. Punitive damages are awarded where the party in
breach of agreement has behaved in a manner, which is reprehensible and calls for punishment.
Nominal damages are awarded where there is no real harm done, by reason of the breach of the
contract.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/129687430/ 26M/S Magma Fincorp Ltd. (Formerly ... vs Rajesh Kumar Tiwari on 1 October, 2020
61. Section 14 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 empowers the District Forum to award
compensation to the party not in breach by directing the party in breach to return the price or the
charges as may have been paid by the complainant [Section 14(1)(c)]. The said Section also enables
the District Forum to award compensatory damages to the consumer for loss or injury suffered by
the consumer due to negligence of the party in breach [Section 14(1)(d)]. The Forum may direct
removal of the deficiency in service, if the deficiency can be removed and it can direct
dis-continuation of unfair trade practices or restrictive practices and direct the same not to be
repeated [Section 14(1)(e) and (f)].
62. The proviso to Section 14(1)(d) of Consumer Protection Act, 1986 empowers the District Forum
to grant punitive damages in such circumstances as it deems fit. Punitive damages are not generally
awarded in cases of breach of contract unless the act is so reprehensible that it calls for punishment
of the party in breach, by imposition of punitive and/or exemplary damages. Compensation which is
compensatory, has to be assessed taking into account relevant factors, such as the loss incurred by
the claimant, though some amount of guess work and/or estimation may be permissible. In the
instant case, the District Forum did not even undertake the exercise of assessment of the
loss/damages, if any, suffered by the complainant by reason of non-service of notice before taking
possession of the vehicle.
63. The District Forum, as also the State Commission and the National Commission, did not
consider the law relating to hire purchases as enunciated by this Court in a plethora of judgments.
64. In Charanjit Singh Chadha & Ors. v. Sudhir Mehra1, relied upon by the Financier, this Court
held:
“5. Hire-purchase agreements are executory contracts under which the goods are let
on hire and the hirer has an option to purchase in accordance with the terms of the
agreement. These types of agreements were originally entered into between the
dealer and the customer and the dealer used to extend credit to the customer. But as
hire- purchase scheme gained in popularity and in size, the dealers who were not
endowed with liberal amount of working capital found it difficult to extend the
scheme to many customers. Then the financiers came into the picture. The finance
company would buy the goods from the dealer and let them to the customer under
hire-purchase agreement. The dealer would deliver the goods to the customer who
would then drop out of the transaction leaving the finance company to collect
instalments directly from the customer. Under hire-purchase agreement, the hirer is
simply paying for the use of the goods and for the option to purchase them. The
finance charge, representing the difference between the cash price and the
hire-purchase price, is not interest but represents a sum which the hirer has to pay
for the privilege of being allowed to discharge the purchase price of goods by
instalments.
7. In Damodar Valley Corpn. v. State of Bihar AIR 1961 SC 440 this Court took the
view that a mere contract of hiring, without more, is a species of the contract of
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/129687430/ 27M/S Magma Fincorp Ltd. (Formerly ... vs Rajesh Kumar Tiwari on 1 October, 2020
bailment, which does not create a title in the bailee, but the law of hire purchase has
undergone considerable development during the last half a century or more and has
introduced a number of variations, thus leading to categories and it becomes a
question of some nicety as to which category a particular contract between the parties
comes under. Ordinarily, a contract of hire purchase confers no title on the hirer, but
a mere option to purchase on fulfilment of certain conditions.
But a contract of hire purchase may also provide for the agreement to purchase the thing hired by
deferred payments subject to the condition that title to the thing shall not pass until all the
instalments have been paid. There may be other variations of a contract of hire purchase depending
upon the terms agreed between the parties. When rights in third parties have been created by acts of
parties or by operation of law, the question may arise as to what exactly were the rights and
obligations of the parties to the original 1 (2001) 7 SCC 417 contract.
65. In Charanjit Singh Chadha (supra), this Court held that a Hire Purchase Agreement is an
executory contract of sale, conferring no right in rem on the hirer, until the conditions for transfer of
the property to him have been fulfilled. The Financier continues to be the owner of the goods under
a hire purchase agreement. The hirer simply pays for use of the goods and for the option to purchase
them. The finance charge, representing the difference between the price and the hire purchase price
represents the sum which the hirer has to pay for the privilege of being allowed to pay the purchase
price in instalments. Where the hirer had defaulted in payment of instalments and the agreement
specifically provided that the Financier was entitled to repossess the vehicle in case of default, no
case was made out against the Financier.
66. In K.L. Johar & Co. v. Deputy Commercial Tax Officer, Coimbatore2 this Court took the view
that a hire-purchase agreement has two elements: (1) element of bailment; and (2) element of sale,
in the sense that it contemplates an eventual sale. The element of sale fructifies when the option is
exercised by the intending purchaser after fulfilling the terms of the agreement. When all the terms
of the agreement are satisfied, and the option is exercised, a sale takes place of the goods, which till
then, had been hired.
2. AIR 1965 SC 1082
67. In Anup Sarmah v. Bhola Nath Sharma and Others 3 cited on behalf of the Financier, this Court
held that, in an agreement of hire-purchase, the purchaser remains merely a trustee/bailee on
behalf of the financier/financial institution and ownership remains with the latter. Thus, in case the
vehicle is seized by the Financier, no criminal action can be taken against the Financier, as the
Financier is only repossessing the goods owned by the Financier.
68. In Orix Auto Finance (India) Ltd. v. Jagmander Singh and Another4, relied upon by the
Financier, this Court held that if the agreement permits the Financier to take possession of the
financed vehicles, there is no legal impediment to such possession being taken. Of course, the hirer
could avail of such statutory remedy as might be available. But the mere fact that possession was
taken could not be a ground to contend that the hirer was prejudiced. As regards the respondent’s
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/129687430/ 28M/S Magma Fincorp Ltd. (Formerly ... vs Rajesh Kumar Tiwari on 1 October, 2020
objection to improper seizure, this Court held that there could not be any generalization. Whether
the seizure was improper, would depend on the facts of each case. However, it would not be
appropriate for the Court to lay down any guideline which would in essence, amount to variation of
the agreed terms of the agreement.
3 (2013) 1 SCC 400 4 (2006) 2 SCC 598
69. In K. A. Mathai alias Babu & Anr. v. Kora Bibbikutty & Anr.5, cited on behalf of the Financier,
this Court held that where the Financier’s Hire Purchase Agreement contained a clause of
resumption, upon failure to make payment of instalments, it could not be said that the Financier
had committed the offence of theft by taking possession of the vehicle covered by the Hire Purchase
Agreement.
70. The Financier has also cited the Judgments Jagdish Chandra Nijhawan v. S.K. Saraf6, and Smt.
Lalmuni Devi v. State of Bihar & Ors.7
71. In Jagdish Chandra Nijhawan (supra), this Court held that where a Chairman, provided with rent
fee furnished flat by the company of which the company was not the lessee, remained in wrongful
possession of the flat after his Chairmanship stood terminated, the dispute was of a civil nature. The
High Court had thus, erred in law in quashing the order of discharge made by the Court of Judicial
Magistrate in a Criminal Revision application. The judgment has no relevance to the issues involved
in this case.
5 (1996) 7 SCC 212 6 (1999) 1 SCC 119 7 (2001) 2 SCC 17
72. In Lalmuni Devi (supra), the issue before this Court was, whether facts which could give rise to a
civil claim, could also amount to offence. This Court held that merely because a civil claim was
maintainable did not mean that the criminal complaint would not be maintained. The Judgment
was rendered in the context of the allegation that the respondent Nos. 2 and 10 had fraudulently got
the father of the complainant to execute a gift deed. The judgment is of no relevance to this case.
73. In Sundaram Finance Ltd. v. The State of Kerala & Anr. 8 the majority of the Judges held that,
the true effect of a transaction might be determined from the terms of the agreement, considered in
the light of surrounding circumstances. An owner of goods, who purports absolutely to convey or
acknowledges to have conveyed goods, and specifically purports to hire them under a Hire Purchase
Agreement, is not estopped from proving that the real bargain was a loan on the security of the
goods. If there is a bona fide and completed sale of goods, evidenced by documents, anterior to and
independent of a subsequent and distinct hiring to the vendor, the transaction may not be regarded
as a loan transaction, even though the reason for which it was entered into, was to raise money. If
the real transaction is a loan transaction, secured by a right of seizure of the goods, the property
passes under the documents embodying the transaction, but subject to the terms of the hiring
agreement, which 8 AIR 1966 SC 1178 become part of the buyer's title, and confer a licence to seize.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/129687430/ 29M/S Magma Fincorp Ltd. (Formerly ... vs Rajesh Kumar Tiwari on 1 October, 2020
74. A hire-purchase is, however a more complex transaction where the owner enters into a
transaction of hiring out goods on the terms and conditions set out in the agreement, and the option
to purchase, exercisable by the customer on payment of all the instalments of hire, arises when the
instalments are paid and not before. In such a hire-purchase agreement there is no agreement to
buy goods; the hirer being under no obligation to buy, has an option either to return the goods or to
become its owner by payment in full of the stipulated hire and the price for exercising the option.
This class of hire-purchase agreements must be distinguished from transactions in which the
customer is the owner of the goods and with a view to finance his purchase he enters into an
arrangement which is in the form of a hire-purchase agreement with the financier, but in substance
evidences a loan transaction, subsequent to a hiring agreement, under which the lender is given the
license to seize the goods.
75. In the aforesaid case, the majority of the judges were of the view that the intention of the
appellants in obtaining the hire- purchase and allied agreements was to secure the return of the
loans advanced to their customers and no real sale of the vehicle was intended by the customer to
the appellants. The transactions were merely financial transactions. The judgment of this Court in
Sundaram Finance Ltd. (supra) was rendered in the context of the liability of a hirer to pay sales tax
on the goods acquired under the Hire Purchase Agreement.
76. In Sundaram Finance Ltd. (supra), Subba Rao, J delivered a dissenting judgment holding:-
“6. The object of the hire-purchase system was to help to finance the customer in
order that he might purchase the property. Though that was the object, the
transaction took the form of hire-purchase agreement. The main feature of the
agreement, apart from small variations, was that the dealer or the financier
continued to be the owner till the terms of the agreement were fully complied with by
the customer and the option to purchase the same was exercised by him. If the terms
were not complied with, the dealer or the financier, as the case may be, could
terminate the agreement and take back the goods. In such a transaction, the common
intention of the dealer, the financier and the customer was that the transaction
should take the form of a hire-purchase agreement which would become a sale on the
compliance of the terms of that agreement. No doubt the financing operation could
have taken the form of a mortgage or pledge, but the parties, for their mutual benefit
and convenience, entered into a hire- purchase transaction.
7. In the absence of any fraud or undue influence, the question resolves itself into a
simple question of intention. The transactions were in accordance with the
mercantile usage. Both the financier and the customers with open eyes entered into
the transactions of hire-purchase. Their intention was expressed in clear terms. They
could have executed hypothecation bonds, but they did not, and instead entered into
hire-purchase transactions. There was no reason to camouflage the real nature of the
transactions. None was suggested. They were, therefore, bound by the terms of the
agreements.”
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/129687430/ 30M/S Magma Fincorp Ltd. (Formerly ... vs Rajesh Kumar Tiwari on 1 October, 2020
77. The law which emerges from the judgments of the Court referred to above, is that goods are let
out on hire under a Hire Purchase Agreement, with an option to purchase, in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Hire Purchase Agreement. The hirer simply pays for the use of the
goods and for the option to purchase them.
78. Until the option to purchase is exercised by the hirer, upon payment of all amounts agreed upon
between the hirer and the Financier, the financier continues to be owner of the goods being the
subject of hire purchase. Till such time the hirer remains a trustee and/or bailee of the goods
covered by the Hire Purchase Agreement.
79. The Financier continues to remain the owner of a vehicle, covered by a hire purchase agreement
till all the hire instalments are paid and the hirer exercises the option to purchase. Thus, when the
Financier takes re-possession of a vehicle under hire, upon default by the hirer in payment of hire
instalments, the Financier takes re- possession of the Financier’s own vehicle.
80. When the agreement between the Financier and the hirer permits the Financier to take
possession of a vehicle financed by the Financier, there is no legal impediment to the Financier
taking possession of the vehicle. When possession of the vehicle is taken, the Financier cannot be
said to have committed theft.
81. Whether the transaction between a Financier and a purchaser/hirer is a hire purchase
transaction, or a loan transaction, might be determined from the terms of the agreement, considered
in the light of surrounding circumstances. However, even a loan transaction, secured by right of
seizure of a financed vehicle, confers licence to the Financier to seize the vehicle.
82. In this case, the agreement executed by and between the Financier and the Complainant is a
Hire Purchase Agreement as will appear from the terms and conditions thereof. In any event, the
fora under the Consumer Protection Act, have not arrived at any specific finding to the contrary.
There is no discussion of the nature of the agreement between the Financier and the Complainant.
Be that as it may, the agreement clearly permits the Financier to take possession of the vehicle, upon
default in payment of instalments.
83. In ICICI Bank Ltd. v. Prakash Kaur & Ors. 9 cited on behalf of the complainant, this Court
deprecated the practice of hiring 9 (2007) 2 SCC 711 Recovery Agents, who were musclemen to take
possession of vehicles in cases, where the borrower might have committed default in payment of
instalments. This Court held:-
“16. Before we part with this matter, we wish to make it clear that we do not
appreciate the procedure adopted by the Bank in removing the vehicle from the
possession of the writ petitioner. The practice of hiring recovery agents, who are
musclemen, is deprecated and needs to be discouraged. The Bank should resort to
procedure recognized by law to take possession of vehicles in cases where the
borrower may have committed default in payment of the instalments instead of
taking resort to strong-arm tactics.”
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/129687430/ 31M/S Magma Fincorp Ltd. (Formerly ... vs Rajesh Kumar Tiwari on 1 October, 2020
84. The Judgment was rendered in the facts and circumstances of the case where it was alleged that
possession of a truck had been taken, by engaging goons and musclemen as Recovery Agents. The
disputes were settled before this Court in view of the submission of Counsel that the truck could be
returned upon payment of a sum of Rs.50,000/-
85. In Citicorp Maruti Finance Ltd. v. S. Vijaylaxmi 10 cited by the complainant, this Court held that
the fora under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 were right in holding that the vehicles had been
illegally and wrongfully recovered by use of force from the loanees. The judgment was rendered in
the facts and circumstance of the case and this Court deprecated the use of force. In this case, there
was no allegation in the complaint of use of force. Significantly, in Citicorp 10 (2012) 1 SCC 1 Maruti
Finance Ltd. (supra), Kabir, J. held:-
“27. Till such time as the ownership is not transferred to the purchaser, the hirer
normally continues to be the owner of the goods, but that does not entitle him on the
strength of the agreement to take back the possession of the vehicle by use of force.
The guidelines which had been laid down by Reserve Bank of India as well as the
appellant Bank itself, it fact, support and make a virtue of such conduct. If any action
is taken for recovery in violation of such guidelines or the principles as laid down by
this Court, such an action cannot be struck down.”
86. This Court held that the Financier continues to be the owner of the goods. There is an obvious
typographical error in paragraph (27) of the judgment where hirer has been erroneously been typed
in place of lender/financier.
87. The question raised by the Financier in this appeal, that is, whether the Financier is the real
owner of the vehicle, which is the subject of a Hire Purchase Agreement, has to be answered in the
affirmative in view of the law enunciated by this Court in Haranjit Singh Chadha (supra), K.L. Johar
& Co. (supra) and Anup Sarmah (supra). The Financier being the owner of the vehicle which is the
subject of a Hire Purchase Agreement, there can be no impediment to the Financier taking
possession of the vehicle when the hirer does not make payment of instalments/hire charges in
terms of the Hire Purchase Agreement. However, such repossession cannot be taken by recourse to
physical violence, assault and/or criminal intimidation. Nor can such possession be taken by
engaging gangsters, goons and musclemen as so called Recovery Agents.
88. Whether the service of proper notice on the hirer would be necessary for repossession of a
vehicle, which is the subject matter of a Hire Purchase Agreement, would depend on the terms and
conditions of the Hire Purchase Agreement, some of which may stand modified by the course of
conduct of the parties. If the hire purchase agreement provides for notice on the hirer before
repossession, such notice would be mandatory. Notice may also be necessary, if a requirement to
give notice is implicit in the agreement from the course of conduct of the parties.
89. If the hirer commits breaches of the conditions of a hire purchase agreement which expressly
provides for immediate repossession of a vehicle without further notice to the hirer, in case of
default in payment of hire charges and/or hire instalments repossession would not be vitiated for
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/129687430/ 32M/S Magma Fincorp Ltd. (Formerly ... vs Rajesh Kumar Tiwari on 1 October, 2020
want of notice. In this case, however a duty to give notice to the Complainant before repossession,
was implicit in the Hire Purchase Agreement. The Hire Purchase Agreement was a stereotype
agreement in a standard form, prepared by the Financier. The same kind of agreements, containing,
identical terms, except for minor modifications are executed by all hirers of vehicles, equipment,
machinery and other goods, who enter into hire purchase agreements with the Financier. The
Financier who set down the terms and conditions of the hire purchase, construed the hire purchase
agreement to contain an implied term for service of notice and accordingly despatched a notice, but
did not address it to the correct address of the Complainant as given in the hire purchase agreement.
90. In a case where the requirement to serve notice before repossession is implicit in the hire
purchase agreement, non service of proper notice would tantamount to deficiency of service for
breach of the hire purchase agreement giving rise to a claim in damages. The Complainant
consumer would be entitled to compensatory damages, based on an assessment of the loss caused to
the complainant by reason of the omission to give notice. Where there is no evidence of any loss to
the hirer by reason of omission to give notice, nominal damages may be awarded.
91. A forum constituted under the Consumer Protection Act has, as observed above, the power to
award punitive damages. Punitive damages should, however, be granted only in exceptional
circumstances, where the action of the Financier is so reprehensible that punishment is warranted.
To cite an example, where a Financier erroneously and/or wrongfully invokes the power to
repossess without notice to the hirer, causing thereby extensive pecuniary loss to the hirer or loss of
goodwill and repute, a forum constituted under the Consumer Protection Act may award punitive
damages.
92. In the instant case, there is no evidence of any loss suffered by the complainant by reason of
non-receipt of notice. Admittedly, several instalments, remained unpaid. After repossession the
complainant contacted the Financier and was informed of the reasons for the repossession. He only
made an offer to pay outstanding instalments and gave an assurance to pay future instalments in
time. If the Financier was not agreeable to accept the offer, the Financier was within its rights under
the hire purchase agreement. This is not a case where payment had been tendered by the hirer but
not accepted by the Financier/lender. The Complainant had not tendered payment.
93. The Financier admittedly paid Rs.3,15,000/- for acquisition of the vehicle, out of which the
Financier had been able to realize Rs.1,19,000/- inclusive of all charges. There was depreciation in
the value of the vehicle by reason of usage by the Complainant, for about a year. The District Forum
did not even notionally assess the depreciation in the value of the vehicle.
94. The District Forum was not justified in directing the Financier to pay the Complainant
Rs.2,23,335/- being the entire amount paid by the Complainant to the Financier from the inception
as well as the payment of Rs.1,04,000/- made by the Complainant to the dealer along with damage
of Rs.10,000/- and litigation costs of Rs.1,000/- after the Complainant had held and used the

receipt of the notice, and without making any assessment of the loss, if at all, to the Complainant by

Rs.15,000/- to the Complainant towards damages for ‘deficiency’ in service and costs for omission
to give the Complainant a proper notice before taking repossession of the vehicle.
