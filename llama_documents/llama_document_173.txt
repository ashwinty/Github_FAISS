2. A shop in house No. D-58/12A-82, Gandhi Nagar, Sigra, Varanasi, was let out by its owner and
landlady Smt. Sita Devi Agarwal (the plaintiff-respondent) to the defendants-tenants/petitioners no.
1 & 2 under a rent agreement dated 06.01.2009 at the monthly rent of Rs. 2,005/-. The tenancy
commenced from 01.01.2009. Thereafter mutually the rent was enhanced with effect from
11.02.2011, from Rs. 2,005/- to Rs. 3,000/- per month. On 09.09.2013, the
plaintiff-landlady/respondent issued a notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act,
1882 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act 1882") to the defendants-tenants/petitioners determining
the tenancy. Since the notice was not complied with by the defendants-tenants/petitioners,
therefore, the plaintiff-landlady filed SCC Suit No. 49 of 2014 (Smt. Sita Devi Agarawal v. Pawan
Kumar & Ors.) which was decreed by judgment and decree dated 24.08.2017 passed by the Judge
Small Cause Court, Varanasi. Aggrieved with this judgment the defendants-tenants/petitioners filed
S.C.C. Revision No. 15 of 2017 (Pawan Kumar and Anr. v. Sita Devi), which was dismissed by the
Additional District Judge/ FTC-1, Varanasi by judgment dated 15.07.2019. Aggrieved with these two
judgments, the defendants-tenants/ petitioners have filed the present petition under Article 227 of
the Constitution of India.
Submissions
3. Learned counsel for the defendants-tenants/ petitioners, submits as under:-
i. The plaintiff-landlady has not appeared in the witness box rather her son and
power of attorney holder Anoop Kumar Agarwal appeared and gave evidence, which
is impermissible in view of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Janki
Vashdeo Bhojwani & Anr. vs. Indusind Bank Ltd. & Ors 2005 2 SCC 217, (para 13).
The judgment of learned Single Judge in Union of India and another v. Sudarshan
Lal Talwar, AIR 2002 (Allahabad) 212 relied by the plaintiff-respondent, has no
application in view of the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court.
ii. A power of attorney was executed by the landlady Sita Devi Agarwal in favour of
her son Anoop Kumar Agarwal on 17.07.2014 and thereafter, suit was instituted on
05.08.2014. Therefore, if the son of the plaintiff was well acquainted with all the facts
of the case and competent to depose on behalf of the plaintiff-landlady, there was no
need to execute the power of attorney. In fact, the son of the plaintiff-landlady was
not aware of the facts of the case and therefore, he was not competent to depose on
behalf of the plaintiff-landlady.
iii. In view of Section 111(h) readwith Section 113 of the Transfer of Property Act,
1882, the institution of a suit after one year of the notice would amount to waiver of
the notice. The notice given by the plaintiff-landlady under Section 106 of the Act,
1882 was no notice in the eyes of law.
iv. The aforesaid notice was issued by the plaintiff-landlady for setting up the
business for her son in the disputed shop who wanted to take franchise of Raymond.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179635434/ 2Pawan Kumar And Another vs Smt. Sita Devi on 26 September, 2019
v. Subsequently the plaintiff-landlady stated that she could not get franchiese of
Raymond because the place was not available whereas in his cross examination son of
the plaintiff-landlady has admitted that the shop was not suitable for franchiese of
Raymonds. Thus, the need set up by the plaintiff-landlady was not bonafide.
vi. The defendants-tenants/petitioners have not violated any of the conditions of the
rent agreement dated 06.01.2009. Therefore, the court below could not have granted
a decree of eviction.
vii. Notice was issued by the plaintiff-landlady on 11.09.2013 under Section 106 of the
Act, 1882 while the suit was instituted on 05.08.2014 and, therefore, the notice stood
waived.
4. In support of his submissions Sri Khare, has relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court
in Man Kaur (dead) by Lrs. Vs. Hartar Singh Sangha (2010)10 SCC 512 (para 18) and Sarup Singh
Gupta Vs. S. Jagdish Singh and others (2006) 4 SCC 205 (para 6).
5. Learned counsel for the plaintiff-landlady/respondent submits as under:-
(i) The plaintiff has neither waived notice nor there is any material to indicate that
there was any intention of the plaintiff to waive the notice. On the contrary after
giving notice, the plaintiff-landlady instituted the suit on 05.08.2014. Thus, the
submissions of learned counsel for the petitioner that the notice stood waived is
wholly incorrect and misconceived
(ii) Anoop Kumar Agarwal is the only son of the plaintiff-landlady to whom she has
given power of attorney. He gave evidence as P.W. 1 in his personal capacity. That
apart he was well aware of all the facts of the case and, therefore, was competent to
depose. Submission of learned counsel for the petitioner are wholly incorrect. Both
the courts below have also found that the evidence given by plaintiff's son was in his
personal capacity.
(iii) After giving notice to the tenant the tenancy stood determined. Therefore, the
defendant-tenant/petitioner was bound to vacate the disputed shop. That apart the
bonafide need of the disputed shop was fully established by the
plaintiff-landlady/respondent.
6. In support of his submissions, learned counsel for the plaintiff-landlady/respondent has relied
upon a judgment of this court in Union of India Vs. Sudarshal Lal Talwar, 2002 AIR (All) 212.
Discussion & Findings
7. I have carefully considered the submissions of learned counsels for the parties.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179635434/ 3Pawan Kumar And Another vs Smt. Sita Devi on 26 September, 2019
Waiver of Notice
8. The submission of learned counsel for the defendant-tenant/petitioner that the plaintiff-landlady
has waived notice dated 11.09.2013 by filing the suit after about 11 months on 05.08.2014 is wholly
misconceived. Section 106 of the Act 1882 provides for termination of tenancy by notice. It does not
provide that the notice of the landlord terminating the tenancy shall stand waived if suit is not filed
within a particular period. Likewise Section 111(h) of the Act 1882 also does not provide for any
limitation for filing a suit after giving notice to quit. On the contrary it provides that lease of
immovable property shall stand determined on expiration of a notice to determine the lease or to
quit, or of intention to quit, the property leased, duly given by one party to the other. Section 113 of
the Act 1882 provides that notice given under Section 111 Clause (h) is waived, with the express or
implied consent of the person to whom it is given, by any act on the part of the person giving it
showing an intention to treat the lease as subsisting.
9. Section 113 of the Act 1882 contains two conditions to waiver, namely :-
(i) Express or implied consent of the person to whom it is given, by any act on the
part of the person giving it
(ii) which shows an intention to treat the lease as subsisting.
10. The principles of waiver are well settled. A waiver is an intentional relinquishment of a known
right. There can be no waiver unless the person against whom the waiver is claimed had full
knowledge of his rights and of facts enabling him to take effectual action for the enforcement of such
rights. Intention of the landlord to treat the lease as subsisting and his knowledge of the fact that his
conduct amounts to waiver, are the basic essentials of waiver contained in Section 113 of the Act
1882.
11. Facts of the present case leaves no manner of doubt that the plaintiff-landlady/respondent has
never waived notice under Section 113 of the Act 1882. On the contrary, after determining the
tenancy by notice dated 11.9.2013, she instituted SCC Suit No.49 of 2014 (Sita Devi Vs. Pawan
Kumar and others) on 5.8.2014. She has been contesting the suit. Thus, no element of waiver of
notice can be inferred on the facts of the present case. In the present case even rent was not accepted
by her after determining the tenancy. Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ganga Dutt Murarka Vs. Kartik
Chandra Das & others, AIR 1961 SC 1067 and this court in Anis Ahmad Vs. Special Judge/Additional
District Judge, Saharanpur 1997(2) ARC 32 have held that mere acceptance of arrears of rent after
expiry of notice or acceptance of rent for the period subsequent to the date of termination of tenancy
by the landlord, does not amount to waiver of notice determining the tenancy under Section 106.
Similar view has also been taken by this Court in Union of India and another Vs. Sudarshan Lal
Talwar (supra).
12. The provisions of Section 113 of the Act has again been interpreted by Hon'ble Supreme Court in
Sarup Singh Gupta's case (supra) which also does not support the case of the petitioner. Paragraph 6
and 8 of the said judgment is reproduced below:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179635434/ 4Pawan Kumar And Another vs Smt. Sita Devi on 26 September, 2019
"6. The Learned Senior Counsel also relied upon a decision of a learned Single Judge
of the Calcutta High Court in Manicklal Dey Chaudhuri v. Kadambini Dassi AIR 1926
Cal 763 wherein it was held that where rent is accepted after the notice to quit,
whether before or after the suit has been filed, the landlord thereby shows an
intention to treat the lease as subsisting and, therefore, where rent deposited with the
Rent Controller under the Calcutta Rent Act is withdrawn even after the ejectment
suit is filed, the notice to quit is waived. In our view, the principle laid down in the
aforesaid judgment of the High Court is too widely stated, and cannot be said to be an
accurate statement of law. A mere perusal of section 113 leaves no room for doubt
that in a given case, a notice given under section 111, clause (h), may be treated as
having been waived, but the necessary condition is that there must be some act on the
part of the person giving the notice evincing an intention to treat the lease as
subsisting. Of course, the express or implied consent of the person to whom such
notice is given must also be established. The question as to whether the person giving
the notice has by his act shown an intention to treat the lease as subsisting is
essentially a question of fact. In reaching a conclusion on this aspect of the matter,
the Court must consider all relevant facts and circumstances, and the mere fact that
rent has been tendered and accepted, cannot be determinative.
8. In the instant case, as we have noticed earlier, two notices to quit were given on
10-2-1979 and 17-3-1979. The suit was filed on 2-6-1979. The tenant offered and the
landlord accepted the rent for the months of April, May and thereafter. The question
is whether this by itself constitutes an act on the part of the landlord showing an
intention to treat the lease as subsisting. In our view, mere acceptance of rent did not
by itself constitute an act of the nature envisaged by section 113, Transfer of Property
Act showing an intention to treat the lease as subsisting. The fact remains that even
after accepting the rent tendered, the landlord did file a suit for eviction, and even
while prosecuting the suit accepted the rent which was being paid to him by the
tenant. It cannot, therefore, be said that by accepting rent, he intended to waive the
notice to quit and to treat the lease as subsisting. We cannot ignore the fact that in
any event, even if rent was neither tendered nor accepted, the landlord in the event of
success would be entitled to the payment of the arrears of rent. To avoid any
controversy, in the event of termination of lease the practice followed by the courts is
to permit the landlord to receive each month by way of compensation for the use and
occupation of the premises, an amount equal to the monthly rent payable by the
tenant. It cannot, therefore, be said that mere acceptance of rent amounts to waiver
of notice to quit unless there be any other evidence to prove or establish that the
landlord so intended. In the instant case, we find no other fact or circumstance to
support the plea of waiver. On the contrary the filing of and prosecution of the
eviction proceeding by the landlord suggests otherwise."
13. In view of the discussion, I do not find any force in the submission of learned counsel for the
defendant-tenant/petitioner that the notice dated 11.9.2013 stood waived Determination of Tenancy
by notice U/S 106 of the Act, 1882 and Bonafide need
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179635434/ 5Pawan Kumar And Another vs Smt. Sita Devi on 26 September, 2019
14. Section 106 of the Act 1882, provides as under :-
"106. Duration of certain leases in absence of written contract or local usage-
"(1) In the absence of a contract or local law or usage to the contrary, a lease of
immovable property for agricultural or manufacturing purposes shall be deemed to
be a lease from year to year, terminable, on the part of either lessor or lessee, by six
months' notice; and a lease of immovable property for any other purpose shall be
deemed to be a lease from month to month, terminable, on the part of either lessor or
lessee, by fifteen days' notice.
(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force,
the period mentioned in sub-section(1) shall commence from the date of receipt of
notice.
(3) A Notice under sub-section(1) shall not be deemed to be invalid merely because
the period mentioned therein falls short of the period specified under that
sub-section, where a suit or proceeding is filed after the expiry of the period
mentioned in that sub-section.
(4) Every notice under sub-section(1) must be in writing, signed by or on behalf of the
person giving it, and either be sent by post to the party who is intended to be bound
by it or be tendered or delivered personally to such party, or to one of his family or
servants at his residence, or (if such tender or delivery is not practicable) affixed to a
conspicuous part of the property."
15. Admittedly, the rent of the disputed shop was Rs.3000/-, per month. Therefore, the provisions of
U.P. Act No.XIII of 1972 are not applicable. The notice dated 11.09.2013 under Section 106 of the
Act, 1882 was issued by the plaintiff-landlady for termination of the tenancy on expiry of 30 days.
Thus, the tenancy stood terminated on expiry of the period of notice.
16. In Jeevan Dass vs. L.I.C. (1994) Suppl. 3 SCC 694, Hon'ble Supreme Court held that "Section 106
of the T.P. Act does indicate that the landlord is entitled to terminate the tenancy by giving 15 days'
notice, if it is a premises occupied on monthly tenancy and by giving 6 months' notice and if the
premises are occupied for agricultural or manufacturing purposes; and on expiry thereof
proceedings could be initiated. Section 106 of the T.P. Act does not contemplate of giving any reason
for terminating the tenancy." Undisputedly in the present set of facts, the tenancy was on month to
month basis and a notice date 09.09.2013 determining the tenancy was issued by the plaintiff
landlady to the defendant-tenant and the tenancy stood determined on expiry of the period of notice
on 30 days. Thereafter the plaintiff-landlady instituted SCC Suit No.49 of 2014 for eviction of the
defendant-tenant.
17. In Sri Ram Urban Infrastructure Ltd. vs. High Court of Bombay, (2015) 5 SCC 539 (Para-18),
Hon'ble Supreme Court held that "if the notice is a short of the period specified in Sub-Section (1)
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179635434/ 6Pawan Kumar And Another vs Smt. Sita Devi on 26 September, 2019
but the suit or proceeding is filed after the expiry of the period mentioned in Sub-Section (1), the
notice shall not be deemed to be invalid even though the suit was filed after six months of the
notice."
18. In Vasantkumar Radhakisan Vora vs. Board of Trustees of the Port of Bombay, (1991) 1 SCC 761
(Para-6), Hon'ble Supreme Court held that "by issuance of notice to quit automatically the right
created thereunder, namely, cessation of the lease, does not become effective till the period
prescribed in the notice or in the statute i.e. Section 106 expires. On expiry thereof the lease
becomes inoperative and the lessor acquires right to have the tenant ejected. When the tenant fails
to deliver vacant possession, the lessor would be entitled to have the tenant ejected and to take
possession in due process of law."
19. In Tata Steel Limited vs. State of Jharkhand, (2015) 15 SCC 55 (Para-33), Hon'ble Supreme
Court held that "Section 111 of the Transfer of Property Act specifies various contingencies in which
a lease of immovable property determines. Clause (h) stipulates that expiration of a notice to
determine the lease duly given by the lessor (in compliance with the requirement of Section 106) is
one of such contingencies but the Transfer of Property Act, does not authorise the lessor to physical
recovery of possession of the property on the determination of the lease. The lessor is still required
to approach the competent court for recovery of possession of the property over which the lease is
terminated." Thus, on expiry of period of notice under Section 106 of the Act, 1882, the contractual
tenancy of the disputed property stood determined. For recovery of possession, the
plaintiff-landlady has approached the competent court by filing the SCC suit.
20. In V. Dhanapal Chettiar v. Yesodai Arnrnal, (1979) 4 SCC 214, a Seven Judges Constitution
Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court held that "in the matter of determination of tenancy, the State
Rent Acts do not permit a landlord to snap his relationship with the tenant merely by serving on him
a notice to quit as is the position under the Transfer of Property Act." The landlord can recover
possession of the property only on one or more of the grounds enacted in the relevant section of the
Rent Act. Even after the termination of the contractual tenancy, the landlord under the definitions
of landlord and tenant contained in the Rent Acts, remains a landlord and a tenant remains a
tenant. The difference between the position obtaining under the Transfer of Property Act and the
Rent Act in the matter of determination of a lease is that under the former Act in order to recover
possession of the leased premises, determination of the lease is necessary because during the
continuance of the lease, the landlord cannot recover possession of the premises while under the
Rent Acts, the landlord becomes entitled to recover possession only on the fulfilment of the
conditions laid down in the relevant sections. He cannot recover possession merely by determining
the tenancy. Nor can he be stopped from doing so on the ground that he has not terminated the
contractual tenancy. The principle laid in V. Dhanapal Chettiar (supra) has also been followed in
Majati Subbarao vs P.K.K. Krishna Rao, (1989) 4 SCC 732 (Para-5). In V. Dhanapal Chettiar (supra),
a Seven Judges Constitution Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court in para-6 appropriately explained the
provisions of Section 106 and Section 111 (h) of the Act, 1882 and held as under:-
"6. Section III deals with the question of determination of lease, and in various
clauses (a) to (h) methods of determination of a lease of immovable property are
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179635434/ 7Pawan Kumar And Another vs Smt. Sita Devi on 26 September, 2019
provided. Clause (g) deals with the forfeiture of lease under certain circumstances
and at the end are added the words "and in any of these cases the lessor or his
transferee gives notice in writing to the lessee of his intention to determine the lease."
The notice spoken of in clause (g) is a different kind of notice and even without the
State Rent Acts different views have been expressed as to whether such a notice in all
cases is necessary or not. We only observe here that when the State Rent Acts provide
under what circumstances and on what grounds a tenant can be evicted, it does
provide that a tenant forfeits his right to continue in occupation of the property and
makes himself liable to be evicted on fulfilment of those conditions. Only in those
State Acts where a specific provision has been made for the giving of any notice
requiring the tenant either to pay the arrears of rent within the specified period or to
do any other thing, such as the Bombay Rent Act or the West Bengal Rent Act, no
notice in accordance with clause (g) is necessary. A lease of immovable property
determines under clause (h):-
"On the expiration of a notice to determine the lease, or to quit, or of intention to
quit, the property leased, duly given by one party to the other."
It is this clause which brings into operation the requirement of section 106 of the Transfer of
Property Act. Without adverting to the effect and the details of waiver of forfeiture, waiver of notice
to quit, relief against forfeiture for non-payment of rent etc. as provided for in sections 112 to 114A of
the Transfer of Property Act, suffice it to say that under the said Act no ground of eviction of a
tenant has to be made out once a contractual tenancy is put to an end by service of a valid notice
under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. Until and unless the lease is determined, the
lessee is entitled to continue in possession. Once it is determined it becomes open to the lessor to
enforce his right of recovery of possession of the property against him. In such a situation it was
plain and clear that if the lease of the immovable property did not stand determined under any of
the clauses (a) to (g) of section 111, a notice to determine it under section 106 was necessary. But
when under the various State Rent Acts, either in one language or the other, it has been provided
that a tenant can be evicted on the grounds mentioned in certain sections of the said Acts, then how
does the question of determination of a tenancy by notice arise? If the State Rent Act requires the
giving of a particular type of notice in order to get a particular kind of relief, such a notice will have
to be given. Or, it may be, that a landlord will be well advised by way of abundant precaution and in
order to lend additional support to his case, to give a notice to his tenant intimating that he intended
to file a suit against him for his eviction on the ground mentioned in the notice. But that is not to say
that such a notice is compulsory or obligatory or that it must fulfil all the technical requirements of
section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. Once the liability to be evicted is incurred by the tenant,
he cannot turn round and say that the contractual lease has not been determined. The action of the
landlord in instituting a suit for eviction on the ground mentioned in any State Rent Act will be
tantamount to an expression of his intention that he does not want the tenant to continue as his
lessee and the jural relationship of lessor and lessee will come to an end on the passing of an order
or a decree for eviction. Until then, under the extended definition of the word 'tenant' under the
various State Rent Acts, the tenant continues to be a tenant even though the contractual tenancy has
been determined by giving a valid notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act. In many
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179635434/ 8Pawan Kumar And Another vs Smt. Sita Devi on 26 September, 2019
cases the distinction between a contractual tenant and a statutory tenant was alluded to for the
purpose of elucidating some particular aspects which cropped up in a particular case. That led to the
criticism of that expression in some of the decisions. Without detaining ourselves on this aspect of
the matter by any elaborate discussion, in our opinion, it will suffice to say that the various State
Rent Control Acts make a serious encroachment in the field of freedom of contract. It does not
permit the landlord to snap his relationship with the tenant merely by his act of serving a notice to
quit on him. In spite of the notice, the law says that he continues to be a tenant and he does so
enjoying all the rights of a lessee and is at the same time deemed to be under all the liabilities such
as payment of rent etc. in accordance with the law."
21. In the aforesaid judgemnt in V. Dhanapal Chettiar (supra), a Seven Judges Constitution Bench of
Hon'ble Supreme Court referred to the earlier Five Judges Bench judgment of Mangilal vs.
Suganchand Rathi, AIR 1965 SC 101 in which it was held as under:-
"The Accommodation Act does not in any way abrogate Chapter V of the Transfer of
Property Act which deals with leases of immovable property. The requirement of
Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act is that a lease from month to month can
be terminated only after giving fifteen days' notice expiring with the end of a month
of the tenancy either by the landlord to the tenant or by the tenant to the landlord.
Such a notice is essential for bringing to an end the relationship of landlord and
tenant. Unless the relationship is validly terminated the landlord does not get the
right to obtain possession of the premises by evicting the tenant. Section 106 of the
Transfer of Property Act does not provide for the satisfaction of any Additional
requirements. But then, Section 4 of the Accommodation Act steps in and provides
that unless one of the several grounds set out therein is established or exists, the
landlord cannot evict the tenant."
22. Thus, in the present set of facts after the tenancy was terminated by the landlady on expiry of the
period of notice dated 09.09.2013 under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, the
consequence is that the relationship of landlady and tenant between the plaintiff-landlady and the
defendant-tenant/ petitioner came to an end and the landlady has right to obtain possession of the
disputed shop by evicting the tenant.
23. Much insistence has been laid by learned counsel for the tenants-petitioners on two lines of the
evidence of P.W. 1 that the space of the disputed shop is not sufficient for the franchise. I have
looked into the evidence of P.W. 1. The evidence of P.W. 1 has to be read as a whole and not in
isolation. I find that P.W.1 has very specifically stated that adjoining the disputed shop is the shop of
his father of Hosiery Goods. He narrated in detail that the tenants-petitioners have not vacated the
disputed shop even after the tenancy was determined. Negotiations were going on for the franchise
but he could not get the franchise. In his evidence on 17.11.2016, P.W.1 stated that for dealership
company gave six months time to arrange for accommodation but the accommodation could not be
arranged.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179635434/ 9Pawan Kumar And Another vs Smt. Sita Devi on 26 September, 2019
24. Both the courts below have recorded the concurrent findings of fact based on consideration of
relevant evidences on record that need of the plaintiff-landlady for the disputed shop is her bonafide
need. Therefore, it requires no interference.
Whether son/power of attorney holder of a landlord can depose on behalf of the landlord in a rent
case in regard to matters involving personal knowledge:-
25. In support of his submission that the P.W. 1 could not have deposed on behalf of the
plaintiff-landlady, learned counsel for the defendants-tenants/petitioners has relied upon the
judgment of Hon'ble Surpeme Court in Man Kaur (supra)(paragrap 18), as under:-
"18. We may now summarise for convenience, the position as to who should give
evidence in regard to matters involving personal knowledge:
(a) An attorney holder who has signed the plaint and instituted the suit, but has no
personal knowledge of the transaction can only give formal evidence about the
validity of the power of attorney and the filing of the suit.
(b) If the attorney holder has done any act or handled any transactions, in pursuance
of the power of attorney granted by the principal, he may be examined as a witness to
prove those acts or transactions. If the attorney holder alone has personal knowledge
of such acts and transactions and not the principal, the attorney holder shall be
examined, if those acts and transactions have to be proved.
(c) The attorney holder cannot depose or give evidence in place of his principal for
the acts done by the principal or transactions or dealings of the principal, of which
principal alone has personal knowledge.
(d) Where the principal at no point of time had personally handled or dealt with or
participated in the transaction and has no personal knowledge of the transaction, and
where the entire transaction has been handled by an attorney holder, necessarily the
attorney holder alone can give evidence in regard to the transaction. This frequently
happens in case of principals carrying on business through authorized
managers/attorney holders or persons residing abroad managing their affairs
through their attorney holders.
(e) Where the entire transaction has been conducted through a particular attorney
holder, the principal has to examine that attorney holder to prove the transaction,
and not a different or subsequent attorney holder.
(f) Where different attorney holders had dealt with the matter at different stages of
the transaction, if evidence has to be led as to what transpired at those different
stages, all the attorney holders will have to be examined.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179635434/ 10Pawan Kumar And Another vs Smt. Sita Devi on 26 September, 2019
(g) Where the law requires or contemplated the plaintiff or other party to a
proceeding, to establish or prove something with reference to his "state of mind" or
"conduct", normally the person concerned alone has to give evidence and not an
attorney holder. A landlord who seeks eviction of his tenant, on the ground of his
"bona fide" need and a purchaser seeking specific performance who has to show his
''readiness and willingness' fall under this category. There is however a recognized
exception to this requirement. Where all the affairs of a party are completely
managed, transacted and looked after by an attorney (who may happen to be a close
family member), it may be possible to accept the evidence of such attorney even with
reference to bona fides or ''readiness and willingness'. Examples of such attorney
holders are a husband/wife exclusively managing the affairs of his/her spouse, a
son/daughter exclusively managing the affairs of an old and infirm parent, a
father/mother exclusively managing the affairs of a son/daughter living abroad.
26. The judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Janki Vashdeo Bhojwani case (supra) relied by
learned counsel for the petitioner has no application on the facts of the present case since it relates
to filing of a suit due to non payment of loan by the borrower and not in a rent case.
27. Besides above, both the courts below have found that the P.W. 1 Anoop Kumar is the only son
and power of attorney holder of the plaintiff landlady who has given his evidence in his personal
capacity. This is a findings of fact.
28. Undisputedly, the plaintiff-landlady has appointed her power of attorney to Sri Anoop Kumar
Agarwal who is the only son of the plaintiff-landlady. In paragraph-2 of the plaint of the S.C.C. Suit
No.49 of 2014, it was clearly stated that the plaintiff-landlady is an old lady and often remains ill,
and, therefore, on her behalf, her son Anoop Kumar Agarwal has always been looking after and
maintaining the disputed house and collecting rent from tenants and taking action for eviction etc.
The contents of this paragraph has been admitted by the defendant-tenant/ petitioner in
paragraph-2 of the written statement. Thus, the evidence given by the power of attorney holder Sri
Anoop Kumar Agarwal (son), falls under the recognised exception of the requirement of giving
evidence by the landlord who seeks eviction of his tenant on the ground of his bona fide need.
Admittedly, power of attorney holder and the only son Sri Anoop Kumar Agarwal has been
exclusively managing the affairs relating to the house in question owned by his mother Smt. Sita
Devi who is an old lady and often remains ill. Therefore, the deposition made by him, cannot be said
to suffer from any legal infirmity, particularly in view of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme
Court in the case of Man Kaur (supra).
Conclusion:-
29. Conclusions reached in foregoing paragraphs of this judgment, are briefly summarized as under:
(i) Intention of landlord to treat the lease as subsisting and his knowledge of the fact
that his conduct amounts to waiver, are the basic essentials of waiver contained in
Section 113 of the Act 1882.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179635434/ 11Pawan Kumar And Another vs Smt. Sita Devi on 26 September, 2019
(ii) Facts of the present case leaves no manner of doubt that the
plaintiff-landlady/respondent has never waived her notice under Section 113 of the
Act 1882. On the contrary, after determining the tenancy by notice dated 11.9.2013,
she instituted SCC Suit No.49 of 2014 (Sita Devi Vs. Pawan Kumar and others) on
5.8.2014. She has been contesting the suit. Thus, no element of waiver of notice can
be inferred on the facts of the present case.
(iii) Mere acceptance of rent did not by itself constitute an act of the nature envisaged
by section 113 of the Transfer of Property Act showing an intention to treat the lease
as subsisting. Even after accepting the rent tendered, a landlord may file a suit for
eviction, and even while prosecuting the suit he may accept the rent which was being
paid to him by the tenant. It cannot, therefore, be said that mere acceptance of rent
amounts to waiver of notice to quit unless there be any other evidence to prove or
establish that the landlord so intended.
(iv) Section 106 of the T.P. Act does indicate that the landlord is entitled to terminate
the tenancy by giving 15 days' notice, if it is a premises occupied on monthly tenancy
and by giving 6 months' notice if the premises is occupied for agricultural or
manufacturing purposes; and on expiry thereof proceedings could be initiated.
Section 106 of the T.P. Act does not contemplate of giving any reason for terminating
the tenancy.
(v) By issuance of notice to quit automatically the right created thereunder, namely,
cessation of the lease, does not become effective till the period prescribed in the
notice or in the statute i.e. Section 106 expires. On expiry thereof the lease becomes
inoperative and the lessor acquires right to have the tenant ejected. When the tenant
fails to deliver vacant possession, the lessor would be entitled to have the tenant
ejected and to take possession in due process of law.
(vi) The difference between the position obtaining under the Transfer of Property Act
and the Rent Act in the matter of determination of a lease is that under the former
Act in order to recover possession of the leased premises, determination of the lease
is necessary because during the continuance of the lease, the landlord cannot recover
possession of the premises while under the Rent Act, the landlord becomes entitled to
recover possession only on the fulfilment of the conditions laid down in the relevant
sections. He cannot recover possession merely by determining the tenancy. Nor can
he be stopped from doing so on the ground that he has not terminated the
contractual tenancy.
(vii) In the present set of facts after the tenancy was terminated by the landlady on
expiry of the period of notice dated 09.09.2013 under Section 106 of the Transfer of
Property Act, the consequence is that the relationship of landlady and tenant between
the plaintiff-landlady and the defendant-tenant/ petitioner came to an end and the
landlady has acquired right to obtain possession of the disputed shop by evicting the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179635434/ 12Pawan Kumar And Another vs Smt. Sita Devi on 26 September, 2019
tenant.
(viii) Both the courts below have recorded concurrent findings of fact based on
consideration of relevant evidences on record that need of the plaintiff-landlady for
the disputed shop is her bonafide need. Therefore, it requires no interference.
(ix) Where the law requires or contemplated the plaintiff or other party to a
proceeding, to establish or prove something with reference to his "state of mind" or
"conduct", normally the person concerned alone has to give evidence and not an
attorney holder. A landlord who seeks eviction of his tenant, on the ground of his
"bona fide" need and a purchaser seeking specific performance who has to show his
''readiness and willingness' fall under this category. There is however a recognized
exception to this requirement. Where all the affairs of a party are completely
managed, transacted and looked after by an attorney (who may happen to be a close
family member), it may be possible to accept the evidence of such attorney even with
reference to bona fides or ''readiness and willingness'. Examples of such attorney
holders are a husband/wife exclusively managing the affairs of his/her spouse, a
son/daughter exclusively managing the affairs of an old and infirm parent, a
father/mother exclusively managing the affairs of a son/daughter living abroad.
(x) Admittedly, power of attorney holder and the only son Sri Anoop Kumar Agarwal
has been exclusively managing the affairs relating to the house in question owned by
his mother Smt. Sita Devi who is an old lady and often remains ill. Therefore, the
deposition made by him, cannot be said to suffer from any legal infirmity,
particularly in view of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Man Kaur (supra).
30. For all the reasons aforestated, I do not find any merit in this petition. Consequently, the
petition is hereby dismissed.
31. After this judgment was dictated in open court, learned counsel for the
defendant-tenant/petitioner states on instructions that the petitioner shall vacate the disputed shop
and shall handover its vacant and peaceful possession to the plaintiff-landlady/respondent on or
before 31.03.2020 and shall also pay to the plaintiff-landlady a sum of Rs.30,000/- for the use and
occupation of the disputed shop for the period from today till 31.03.2020, within a month and,
therefore till 31.03.2020 the defendant-tenant/petitioner may not be dispossessed from the
disputed shop. Learned counsel for the plaintiff-landlord/respondent has no serious objection to the
aforesaid request.
32. Considering the statement made by the defendant-tenant/petitioner as aforenoted, it is provided
as under:-
i). If the defendant-tenant/petitioner submits an undertaking to the aforesaid affect
before the court below and also deposit Rs.30,000/- within a month from today, then
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/179635434/ 13Pawan Kumar And Another vs Smt. Sita Devi on 26 September, 2019
in that event he shall not be dispossessed from the disputed shop till 31.03.2020.
ii). In the event, either the undertaking as aforesaid is not submitted or a sum of Rs.
30,000/- is not deposited within the stipulated period, then the protection given to
the defendant-tenant/petitioner under this order shall automatically stand vacated.
iii). In the event, the defendant-tenant/petitioner does not vacate the disputed shop
and does not hand over its vacant and peaceful possession to the
plaintiff-landlady/respondent on or before 31.03.2020, then apart from other
consequences as may follow, the defendant-tenant/petitioner shall also pay a sum of
Rs. 1,000/- per day for each day of delay after 31.03.2020, in vacating the disputed
shop and handing over its vacant and peaceful possession to the plaintiff-landlady/
respondent.
