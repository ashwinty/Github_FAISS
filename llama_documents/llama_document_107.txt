State Of Tamil Nadu vs N. Ramu Bros. (Electricals) on 23
September, 1992
JUDGMENT
Abdul Hadi, J.
1. T.C. Nos. 107 and 108 of 1983 are against two appeals on the file of Tamil Nadu Sales Tax
Appellate Tribunal (Additional Bench), Coimbatore-18. T.C. No. 85 of 1983 is against the
enhancement petition filed in those appeals. The said appeals C.T.A. Nos. 398 and 399 of 1981 and
the enhancement petition, C.T.M.P. No. 180 of 1981 were disposed of by a common order dated
October 5, 1981. The said appeals were preferred by the assessees/respondent herein and the said
enhancement petition was filed by the Revenue, the petitioner in all the abovesaid tax cases. All the
matters relate to the same assessees and pertain to the assessment year 1973-74. C.T.A. No. 398 of
1981 is against the tax levied under the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act, 1959 (hereinafter
referred to as "the State Act") and C.T.A. No. 399 of 1981 is against the consequent levy of surcharge.
2. The only question involved in these matters is whether, as contended by the assessees and found
by the Tribunal, section 6(2) of the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as "the
Central Act") would apply to the turnover in question, or, as contended by the Revenue, the said
turnover would only be an intra-State sale, coming under the State Act. If section 6(2) of the Central
Act applies, the turnover is completely exempt from tax. If the State Act applies, since the goods sold
are generators, they are taxable at the rate of 9 per cent., i.e., single point levy at the point of first
sale.
3. It is well-known that there are two types of inter-State sales which are charged to tax under the
Central Act, one, coming under section 3(a) of the Central Act, namely, sale occasioning movement
of goods from one State to another, and, the other, coming under section 3(b) of the Central Act, i.e.,
sale effected by transfer of documents of title to goods during their movement from one State to
another. However, section 6(2) of the Central Act grants, subject to certain qualifications and
fulfilment of certain formalities, exemption to an inter-State of goods coming under section 3(b), if
it is subsequent to an earlier inter-State sale of section 3(a) type or section 3(b) type, provided the
said subsequent sale is effected during the movement of said goods from one State to another. In
other words, if such a subsequent inter-State sale is effected by transfer of documents of title to
goods, during the movement of goods from one State to another pursuant to an earlier inter-State
sale, such subsequent inter-State sale is exempted from tax.
4. The Tribunal below, having held that the turnover in question was such an inter-State sale coming
under section 6(2) of the Central Act, exempted it from tax. But the Revenue's contention is that the
turnover in question has been effected by the assessees in Tamil Nadu locally only after the above
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1530331/ 1State Of Tamil Nadu vs N. Ramu Bros. (Electricals) on 23 September, 1992
referred movement pursuant to the former inter-State sale came to an end and that, therefore,
assessable to tax as an inter-State sale, under the State Act.
5. Though, originally, the assessing officer granted exemption under section 6(2), after inspection by
the intelligence wing officers on September 7, 1978 and November 10, 1978 and recovering certain
records, the exemption earlier granted was revoked in respect of a turnover of Rs. 41,59,000 relating
to sales effected by the assessees, in favour of 15 registered dealers and the said turnover was
charged to tax at 9 per cent. under the State Act, invoking section 16(1) of the State Act and revising
the original assessment. Consequently, an assessment under the Tamil Nadu Sales Tax (Surcharge)
Act, 1971, was also made.
6. In the two appeals, subsequently filed by the assessees to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner,
he granted relief to the assessees as prayed for excepting in relation to the turnover therein to the
extent of Rs. 1,08,400 which related to the sales in favour of one of the above 15 persons and a
portion of the sales in favour of another, of them. In respect of the said turnover of Rs. 1,08,400
both tax and consequent surcharge were sustained.
7. Not satisfied, the assessees filed the above referred to two second appeals before the Tribunal.
Therein, the Revenue filed the above referred to enhancement petition claiming that the entire
revised assessment must be sustained and not merely the above referred to Rs. 1,08,400.
8. The Tribunal dismissed the enhancement petition in toto and allowed the appeal relating to tax
under the State Act, only to the extent of Rs. 5,000 out of the abovesaid Rs. 1,08,400. In the other
appeal regarding surcharge, necessary modification was allowed to be made. Hence the abovesaid
tax cases have been filed by the Revenue.
9. Before adverting to the submissions of the counsel on either side, we may point out the facts as
found by the Tribunal :
The assessees sold generators to its various customers in this State. The intending
purchasers placed orders for the said generators with the assessees. The assessees, on
receiving the purchase orders, placed orders with the outside-State sellers, mostly
from Delhi. Those outside-State sellers executed the orders placed by the assessees,
despatched the goods through lorries of South Eastern Roadways, who were having
their transport offices at the place of those outside-State sellers and also at
Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu. On despatch of the consignments, those sellers outside
the State, advised the assessees through postal communication, about the transport
way-bill number, freight payable, insurance charges, etc. On receiving necessary
particulars of the movement of the goods after despatch, the assessees informed its
purchasers. Then the said purchasers paid the necessary transport charges from the
place of origin outside the State and took delivery of the goods at their own respective
business places in Tamil Nadu. The said purchasers also paid the transit insurance
charges and other incidental charges before taking delivery of the consignments by
themselves. (Anyway, as per the assessing officer's order, in some cases, the assessees
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1530331/ 2State Of Tamil Nadu vs N. Ramu Bros. (Electricals) on 23 September, 1992
paid the said charges initially and got reimbursed from the said purchasers
subsequently). Since South Eastern Roadways are not having their own transport
office in all places of destination, the assessees gave necessary "letters of authority" to
the lorry office of the said carrier at Coimbatore with instructions to deliver the
consignments to the assessee's purchasers in their doorsteps. (As per the assessing
officer's order, in some cases, the assessees themselves rebooked the goods through
the same carrier from Coimbatore to their purchasers' places in Tamil Nadu,
obtaining fresh lorry receipts or way bills, showing assessees as consignors). The
assessees used their own from XX delivery notes for onward transport of the
consignments from Coimbatore to various places of the said purchasers in Tamil
Nadu. (As per the assessing officer's order, in some cases, the said form XX delivery
notes were issued by the respective consignees-purchasers.)
10. According to the Revenue, there was termination of the abovesaid movement of goods at
Coimbatore and the assessees had taken notional deliveries of the goods at Coimbatore and then the
goods were booked covered by those form XX delivery notes. So, according to the Revenue, the
abovesaid subsequent sales by the assessees were only intra-State sales liable to be taxed under the
State Act.
11. The learned Additional Government Pleader (Taxes), Mrs. Chitra Venkataraman, appearing for
the petitioner, particularly submits that two main requirements which are necessary for the
application of section 6(2) have not been fulfilled in the present case and that the Tribunal has erred
in not approaching the question in that light. According to section 6(2), inter alia, a sale if it is to be
exempted, must be a second or subsequent sale in the course of the inter-State trade or commerce as
stated above, and the said sale must be effected by transfer of documents of title to goods during the
movement of the goods from one State to another pursuant to an earlier inter-State sale, as stated
above.
12. Regarding the first of the above requirements, her submission is that in the present case there is
no evidence at all as to when actually such second or subsequent sale has taken place. Substantiating
the said submission, she also relied on Tata Iron and Steel Co. Limited v. S. R. Sarkar . She also
points out that admittedly as per lorry receipts pursuant to the sales in favour of the assessees, the
destination of the goods in their movements from Delhi and other places outside Tamil Nadu is only
Coimbatore and not the other places in Tamil Nadu to which the goods were subsequently sent by
the assessees and that, pursuant to the respective subsequent sales, admittedly, there are no
transfers of those lorry receipts, in favour of the abovesaid purchasers of the assessees. It has also
been so found in the abovesaid revised assessment order. She also points out that though there are
no physical deliveries to the assessees at Coimbatore, there are notional deliveries at Coimbatore to
the assessees and that thereafter only the assessees make certain arrangements for the goods being
delivered physically to their purchasers at different places in Tamil Nadu. She also points out that in
some of the sales in favour of the abovesaid 15 persons, there is also rebooking of the goods for
transportation from Coimbatore to the respective places of the purchasers by separate lorry receipts
in which only the assessees figured as consignors, as found in the abovesaid revised assessment.

13. Further, regarding the second of the abovesaid requirements, her submission is that in the
present case the turnovers in question do not at all represent sales effected by transfer of
"documents of title to goods". She further points out that the abovesaid delivery notes in form XX
are not "documents of title to goods" at all. In this connection she drew our attention to section 2(4)
of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, which defines the said term and also to the decision in Laurie and
Morewood v. John Dudin and Sons [1925] 2 KB 383. She also submits that admittedly there are no
endorsements of the lorry receipts under which the goods were sent from Delhi to Coimbatore, in
favour of the assessees' purchasers in different places in Tamil Nadu.
14. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondents/assessees drew our attention to
Explanation 1 to section 3(b) of the Central Act, according to which the movement of goods, when
goods are sent by a carrier pursuant to an inter-State sale under section 3(b) of the Central Act, shall
be deemed to terminate "at the time when the delivery is taken from said carrier" Since no delivery
was taken at Coimbatore and deliveries were taken from the carrier only at the respective places of
the assessees' purchasers, the sales effected by the assessees in favour of those purchasers were only
prior to the said deliveries and, therefore, could rightly come under section 3(b) and section 6(2) of
the Central Act, according to the learned counsel for the respondents.
15. He also maintains that the abovesaid delivery notes coupled with the above referred to
"authorisation letters" to the carrier for effecting delivery at various places of the assessees'
purchasers and also the relevant invoices of the assessees in favour of the said purchasers, would all
come under the term "document of title to goods". He also submits that there is no necessity to
make an endorsement in the relevant lorry receipts relating to movement from Delhi and other
outside places to Coimbatore, for the assessees to effect those subsequent inter-State sales by
transfer of documents of title of goods. In this connection, he relied on Deputy Commissioner of
Commercial Taxes v. A. R. S. Thirumeninatha Nadar Firm [1968] 21 STC 184 (Mad.) and Bayyana
Bhimayya & Sukhdevi Rathi v. Government of Andhra Pradesh . He also submits that the facts in
Lucas Electrical Tractor Service Limited v. State of Tamil Nadu [1984] 55 STC 286 (Mad.) are
similar and the decision given therein, granting exemption under section 6(2), should be followed in
the present case also.
16. We have considered the rival submissions. We will first take up the second submission made by
the learned Additional Government Pleader (Taxes). In her second submission she points out that
one requirement for availing section 6(2) exemption, is that the abovesaid second or subsequent
inter-State sales must have been effected by transfer of documents of title to goods. From section
6(2), it is clear that this is one of the several requirements provided under section 6(2). In other
words, if the said subsequent inter-State sales are effected by any other mode other than by transfer
of document of title to goods, section 6(2) exemption cannot be granted at all. Here, first we have to
consider, which document in the present case, would come under the definition of the term
"document of title to goods", under section 2(4) of the Sale of Goods Act and whether the sale is
effected by transfer of the said document of title to goods. No doubt, the expression "sale effected by
a transfer of documents of title to goods" means that title in the goods passed on to the buyer by the
said transfer of documents of title to said goods. In other words, the term "effected" denotes the
abovesaid passing of title, vide Tata Iron and Steel Co. Limited v. S. R. Sarkar .
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1530331/ 4State Of Tamil Nadu vs N. Ramu Bros. (Electricals) on 23 September, 1992
17. The term "document of title to goods" is defined under section 2(4) of the Sale of Goods Act,
1930, as follows :
"'document of title to goods' includes a bill of lading, dock-warrant,
warehouse-keeper's certificate, wharfinger's certificate, railway receipt, warrant or
order for the delivery of goods and any other document used in the ordinary course of
business as proof of the possession or control of goods, or authorising or purporting
to authorize, either by endorsement or by delivery, the processor of the document to
transfer or receive goods thereby represented;"
The abovesaid lorry receipts relating to transport from Delhi and other outside places to
Coimbatore, no doubt, would come under the abovesaid definition but admittedly they were not
transferred to the abovesaid purchasers of the assessees for effecting sales in favour of them as
contemplated under section 6(2) of the Central Act. On the other hand, the contention is that the
abovesaid delivery notes coupled with the authorisation letters and invoices would come under the
abovesaid definition of "documents of title to goods". But we are unable to accept this contention.
No doubt, an order from the vendor to the warehouseman to deliver goods to the vendee would
certainly come under the abovesaid definition [also see Bayyana Bhimayya & Sukhdevi Rathi v.
Government of Andhra Pradesh . The abovesaid delivery notes in form XX, by no stretch of
imagination can be taken as such delivery orders. The said form XX is prescribed pursuant to rule
35(5) of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Rules, 1959. The said rule 35 deals with check-posts and
clause (5) therein was framed pursuant to section 40(3) of the State Act which says :
"Every registered dealer or person who moves goods in pursuance of a sale or
purchase or otherwise from one place to another shall send along with the goods
moved a bill of sale or delivery note or such other documents as may be prescribed."
18. Further, as per the said form XX, only certain particulars regarding the consignor and consignee
and the goods consigned have to be given therein and the consignor or consignee has to certify that
the particulars given therein are true. The said form does not at all contain any order as such by the
vendor for delivery of goods to the vendee. Form No. XX has been prescribed under rules 35(5) and
36(1) of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Rules, as one of the documents to accompany the goods
transported in a vehicle or boat and the direction contained in the said form to give the original copy
to the officer-in-charge of the first check-post or barrier and the second copy to the officer-in-charge
of the last check-post and retain the third copy by the person-in-charge of the goods vehicle or boat,
would go to show that it was meant only to keep track of the movement of the goods to prevent
evasion of tax and by no stretch of imagination could the same be held to be a document of title
within the meaning of section 2(4) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. Even as per the above definition
under section 2(4) of the Sale of Goods Act, only "warrant or order for the delivery of the goods" can
be document of title to goods. It is the position in both English law and Indian law. In the above
referred to English decision [1925] 2 KB 383 (Laurie and Morewood v. John Dudin and Sons) the
facts were as follows :
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1530331/ 5State Of Tamil Nadu vs N. Ramu Bros. (Electricals) on 23 September, 1992
The defendants, warehousemen and wharfingers, held goods belonging to one "A"
who sold a part of the said goods to "W" who, in turn, sold them to the plaintiffs
therein, giving the latter a delivery note, which they lodged with the defendants. The
defendants did not acknowledge it but some days later, no weighing out or
appropriation of the said goods having taken place, "A" stopped delivery. In that
context, the English court held that the abovesaid delivery note handed over to the
plaintiffs by "W" was not a document of title to goods within the meaning of the Sale
of Goods Act (1893) (of England).
19. Further we have to see whether the abovesaid "authorisation letters" could be considered as
documents of title to goods coming within the abovesaid definition under section 2(4) of the Sale of
Goods Act. Regarding one such authorisation letter given by the assessees to the carrier, the
Tribunal, by way of illustration, factually finds as follows :
"They (assessees) have stated in this letter that the generating set is in transit and the
set need not be delivered to them but it may be transported to Kil Kotagiri and
delivered to M/s. Kil Kotagiri Industrial Co-operative Tea Factory Limited (one of the
abovesaid 15 persons), Bazaar Post, Kil Kotagiri, Nilgiris District, directly. They have
also stated that they have already advised the purchasers regarding the transport and
delivery charges of Rs. 4,201 to be paid on delivery at their factory. On receiving this
letter M/s. South Eastern Roadways by their letter dated May 30, 1973, have
responded to the appellants (assessees) and stated that they have taken the set
directly to M/s. Kil Kotagiri Industrial Co-operative Tea Factory Limited, Kil
Kotagiri, Big Bazaar Post, Nilgiris District, and has also delivered the set to the
purchaser."
So, actually, the abovesaid "authorisation letters" are only instructions given by the assessees to the
abovesaid carrier to deliver the goods, stating that the carrier need not deliver the goods at
Coimbatore but has to deliver the respective goods to the respective purchasers at different places in
Tamil Nadu and collect the delivery charges from them on delivery of the goods. However, even
though these letters may look like delivery orders, they cannot be considered as documents of title to
goods, coming within the abovesaid definition under section 2(4), because, even a delivery order
which has been specifically mentioned in that definition, must satisfy the requirements mentioned
in the latter part of the said definition, namely, used in the ordinary course of business, as proof of
possession or control of goods, or authorising its possessor to transfer or receive goods thereby
represented. It has also been so held in Ramdas Vittaldas v. Amarchand & Co. AIR 1916 PC 7 and
AIR 1949 Nag 186 (Abdul Shakur Ali Mohamad v. Motiram Premji Bhate) by Hidayathullah, J. as he
then was. But in the present case it is not proved that the requirements mentioned in the abovesaid
latter part of the definition under section 2(4) of the Sale of Goods Act, have been fulfilled with
references to these "authorisation letters".
Therefore, we cannot treat the abovesaid "authorisation letters" as "documents of title to goods"
within the meaning of the abovesaid definition.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1530331/ 6State Of Tamil Nadu vs N. Ramu Bros. (Electricals) on 23 September, 1992
20. Likewise, the abovesaid invoices also could not come under the abovesaid definition since they
also do not satisfy the requirements contained in the abovesaid latter part of section 2(4) of the Sale
of Goods Act.
21. So, in our view, the Tribunal committed an error of law, in not having considered the case, in the
light of the abovesaid definition of the term "document of title to goods" found in section 2(4) of the
Sale of Goods Act.
22. No doubt, if a sale is to be effected by transfer of title to goods, there is no requirement that such
transfer could be effected only by endorsing the document of title to goods in favour of the
purchasers. The above referred Deputy Commissioner Taxes v. A. R. S Thirumeninatha Nadar Firm
[1968] 21 STC 184 (Mad.) dealt with the case of a sale in the course of the import, by transfer of title
to goods coming under section 5(2) of the Central Act, where also similar expression was used as
found in section 6(2) and section 3(b) of the Central Act. In that context a Division Considering
these commercial facts, it is difficult to accede to the retailer's contention that the movement of
goods continues even if the goods have landed in Delhi only because the importer has transferred
the documents of title to the purchasing retailers and such retailers take delivery from the railways
at a subsequent time. If taking delivery is the test of termination of movement and not the landing of
the goods in any importing State, explanation 1 to section 3(b) of the Central Sales Tax would lead to
anomalous results. If, after the landing of the goods in Delhi, the railway receipts are endorsed one
after another to ten persons and the delivery is taken by the tenth person, say after three months,
the movement of goods would on the dealer's interpretation artificially continue for three months
after the landing of the goods in Delhi. ..... The expanded concept of the movement of goods added
by explanation 1 to section 3(b) of the Central Sales Tax Act, on our interpretation, does not pose
any difficulty, as we have already held that explanation 1 to section 3(b) does not permit a purchaser
from the dealer to 'expand the movement' of goods beyond the time of the physical landing of the
goods in the Union Territory of Delhi."
Therefore, the abovesaid movement of goods came to an end at Coimbatore at the time when the
said notional deliveries were effected there and so the subsequent sales by the assessees are only
after the termination of such movement. Therefore also, section 6(2) exemption cannot be granted.
Regarding this point also the Tribunal has not approached the questions correctly and erred in law.
25. In the decision reported in Lucas Electrical Tractor Service Limited v. State of Tamil Nadu
[1984] 55 STC 286 (Mad.) the facts are distinguishable from the present facts and so exemption
cannot be granted in the present case. In that case there were three items of turnover and with
reference to the first one, the exemption under section 6(2) of the Central Act was claimed.
Regarding the first item, the facts were :
The assessee (who was at Madras) purchased batteries from a seller in Calcutta. It
later sold the same to a buyer in Madras itself, before the goods were delivered by the
carrier to the said buyer, after transporting them to Madras. The assessee claimed
exemption, under section 6(2) with reference to the sale to the abovesaid buyer at
Madras. In that context, it was found by a Division Bench of this Court that
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1530331/ 7State Of Tamil Nadu vs N. Ramu Bros. (Electricals) on 23 September, 1992
inter-State movement, from Calcutta to Madras, stood terminated only on the
delivery of the goods at Madras to the buyer of the assessee and long before the said
termination, the goods have been sold by the assessee to the said buyer. Thus it is not
a case where the goods were further transported from Madras to some other places in
order to effect deliveries to the buyer of the assessee, as in the present case. Further,
in the above case, there was also endorsement on the lorry way-bill in favour of the
said buyer, unlike in the present case.
26. The net result is the order of the Tribunal below is set aside and the abovesaid revised
assessment is restored and these three tax revisions are allowed. In the circumstances of the case,
there will be no order as to costs.
27. Petitions allowed.
