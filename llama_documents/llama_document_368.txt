Argued by: Sh. Nirmal Singh Dhiman, appellant in person.
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128736330/ 3Nirmal Singh Dhiman vs Financial Commissioner Revenue, ... on 1 March, 2013
PER JUSTICE SHAM SUNDER (RETD.), PRESIDENT This appeal is directed against the order
dated 03.01.2013, rendered by the District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum-II, U.T.,
Chandigarh (hereinafter to be called as the District Forum only) vide which, it dismissed the
complaint, filed by the complainant (now appellant), at the same time giving him liberty to approach
the appropriate authority, under the Right to Information Act, 2005, for redressal of his grievance.
2. The facts, in brief, are that the complainant retired as Superintendent Grade-I, on 31.01.2006,
from the office of the Financial Commissioner Secretariat, Punjab. The retiral benefits due, were not
paid to him, on time. For the redressal of his grievance, the complainant made a representation, to
Opposite Party No.2, under the Right to Information Act, 2005, to supply him the details of
correspondence/information, regarding his retiral benefits. It was stated that the information was
not supplied to the complainant. It was further stated that the Opposite Parties, did not comply with
the Rules, for granting provisional pension, as he was not given, an opportunity of personal hearing,
for deciding his case. It was further stated that Opposite Party No. 2, did not exercise her powers,
correctly, and had not submitted the representation, made by the complainant, to the Financial
Commissioner Revenue, Punjab, in time. It was further stated that due to non-supply of
information, by the Public Information Officer/Opposite Party No.2, as requested by the
complainant, under the Right to Information Act, 2005, a lot of mental agony and physical
harassment was caused to him (complainant). It was further stated that even the act of non-supply
of information by Opposite Party No.2, to the complainant, under the Right to Information Act,
2005, amounted to deficiency, in rendering service. When the grievance of the complainant, was not
redressed, left with no alternative, a complaint under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act,
1986, was filed, directing the Opposite Parties, to pay compensation, in the sum of Rs.50,000/-, for
mental agony and physical harassment; and cost of litigation, to the tune of Rs.10,000/-, within six
weeks, failing which, to pay interest @ 9% P.A., on the amount of compensation and litigation costs.
3. The Opposite Parties, in their joint written version, pleaded that earlier, the complainant had
filed a complaint, on 5.5.2008, before the District Forum, on the same subject matter, and after the
reply was filed by them (Opposite Parties), he (complainant) withdrew the same, which was
disposed of, with a liberty having been granted to him, to file a fresh one. It was further pleaded that
the complainant requested for some information, under the Right to Information Act, 2005, and, if,
according to him, he was not supplied the same, he could approach the First Appellant Authority,
under the said Act, for redressal of his grievance, and, as such, the Consumer Complaint, under the
Consumer Protection Act, 1986, was not maintainable. It was further pleaded that the complainant,
did not fall within the definition of a consumer, under Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection
Act, 1986. It was further pleaded that the action of the Department, did not fall within the definition
of Service as per clause 2(6) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. It was stated that the
complainant had been disbursed, all the pensionary benefits, as per statutory Rules. It was further
stated that, he was allowed extra step-up increments, during his service, which were not due to him,
but, subsequently, on the audit objection, the said increments were withdrawn. It was further stated
that Civil Writ Petition No. 12630 of 2007, titled as Sohan Lal and Others Versus State of Punjab
and Others, was filed, wherein, the complainant was also a petitioner. The said Civil Writ Petition
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128736330/ 4Nirmal Singh Dhiman vs Financial Commissioner Revenue, ... on 1 March, 2013
was decided on 30.4.2007, whereby, the order of fixation of pay of the Petitioners, including the
complainant, withdrawing the extra increments, was maintained. However, the recovery was not
allowed. It was further stated that the complainant was given an opportunity, for personal hearing,
by the Financial Commissioner Revenue, Punjab, when the order on 26.11.2009, was passed. It was
further stated that neither there was any deficiency, in rendering service, on the part of the Opposite
Parties, nor they indulged into unfair trade practice. The remaining averments, were denied, being
wrong.
4. The Parties led evidence, in support of their case.
5. After hearing the complainant, Senior State Counsel for the Opposite Parties, and, on going
through the evidence, and record of the case, the District Forum, dismissed the complaint, as stated
above, on the ground, that it would not be appropriate, to pass an order, against the Opposite
Parties, when the complainant had a remedy available under Section 19 of the Right to Information
Act, 2005, for redressal of his grievance.
6. Feeling aggrieved, the instant appeal has been filed by the appellant/complainant.
7. We have heard the appellant, in person, at the admission stage, and, have gone through
the evidence and record of the case, carefully.
8. The first question, that falls, for consideration, is, as to whether, the District Forum had
Jurisdiction, to entertain and decide the complaint, under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, or
not. It may be stated here, that under Section 3 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, additional
remedy is provided for speedy, inexpensive and affordable relief, to the consumers, but that would
be available, where there is no express bar, under some Statutory provisions. Such bar is apparent, if
we refer to Section 23 of the Right to Information Act, 2005, which reads as under:-
Bar of jurisdiction of Courts: No Court shall entertain any suit, application or other proceeding in
respect of any order made, under this Act, and no such order shall be called, in question, otherwise
than by way of an appeal under this Act.
It was held in Patel Roadways Limited vs Birla Yamaha Limited (2000) 4 SCC 91, that a complaint
before the Consumer Forum falls within the ambit of word `Suit`. Further the expression `Court`
used in the aforesaid Section, is a generic term, taking within its sweep, all the Authorities, having
the trappings of the Court. As Consumer Forums are having the trappings of the Court and are, in
fact, specifically conferred the same powers, as are vested in a Civil Court, under the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908) in respect of the matters listed in Section 13 of the Consumer Protection
Act, 1986, the Consumer Forums are covered within the expression Court. In Trans-Mediterranean
Airways Vs. M/s Universal Exports and another (2011(4) RCR (Civil) 472 (SC), it was held as
under:-
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128736330/ 5Nirmal Singh Dhiman vs Financial Commissioner Revenue, ... on 1 March, 2013
The use of the word Court in Rule 29 of the Second Schedule of the CA Act has been borrowed from
the Warsaw Convention. We are of the view that the word Court has not been used in the strict sense
in the Convention as has come to be in our procedural law. The word Court has been employed to
mean a body that adjudicates a dispute arising under the provisions of the CP Act. The CP Act gives
the District Forums, State Forums, and National Commission, the power to decide disputes of
consumers. The jurisdiction, the power and procedure of these Forums are all clearly enumerated by
the CP Act. Though, these Forums decide matters after following a summary procedure, their main
function is still to decide disputes, which is the main function and purpose of a Court. We are of the
View that for the purpose of the CA Act and the Warsaw Convention, the Consumer Forums can fall
within the meaning of the expression Court.
9. The perusal of the provisions of Section 23 of the Right to Information Act, 2005, extracted
above, reveals that, no Court shall entertain any suit, application or other proceeding, in respect of
any order, made under the Right to Information Act, 2005, and no such order shall be called, in
question, otherwise than by way of an appeal, under the Right to Information Act, 2005. In case, the
complainant was aggrieved against the non-supply of information, aforesaid, by the Public
Information Officer/Opposite Party No.2, in pursuance of the application, moved by him, under the
Right to Information Act, 2005, the remedy which lay with him, was to file an appeal before the
First Appellate Authority, under the said Act, praying for the supply of information. After availing of
such remedy, even if, he still felt aggrieved, he had the remedy of filing the second appeal, under
Section 19 of the Right to Information Act, 2005. Once, a particular route was adopted by the
complainant, under the Right to Information Act, 2005, he was required to seek further remedies,
under that very Act, but he failed to do so. In view of the specific bar created by Section 23 of the
Right to Information Act, 2005, in our considered opinion, the District Forum, had no Jurisdiction,
to entertain and decide the complaint, under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The
District Forum, in our considered opinion, was, thus, right in holding that it had no Jurisdiction, to
entertain and decide the complaint.
10. The next question, that falls for consideration, is, as to, what is the effect of Section 3 of the
Consumer Protection Act, 1986, which provides that the provisions of the Act, are in addition to, and
not in derogation of the provisions of any other law, for the time being, in force. This part of the
Section is to be divided into two parts, namely (1) in addition to the provisions of any other law, for
the time being, in force, and (2) the provisions of the Act are not in derogation of the provisions of
any other law, for the time being, in force. For the first part, the effect of the aforesaid provision, is
that, even if, there is an alternative remedy, available under some provision of any other Act, or, say,
even if Civil Suit is maintainable, for a particular cause, the proceedings under the Consumer
Protection Act, 1986, are maintainable. The reason being, it is an additional speedy remedy,
provided to the consumers.
11. However, with regard to the second part, namely, not in derogation of the provisions of any
other law, for the time being, in force, would mean that it is not in abrogation, repeal or deviation of
any other law, which is in force. This would mean that where there is an express bar, to initiate
proceedings, in any other Court, or Forum, the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, will not have any
overriding effect. Once there is a bar, created under the Statute, giving exclusive jurisdiction, to the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128736330/ 6Nirmal Singh Dhiman vs Financial Commissioner Revenue, ... on 1 March, 2013
Court or the Tribunal, the provision that excludes the jurisdiction of the other Court or Tribunal will
be effective and the proceedings could not be initiated, in any other Tribunal/Forum or the Court,
except the Forum constituted under the provisions of the said Act. Similar principle of law, was laid
down in T. Pundalika Vs. Revenue Department (Service Division) Government of Karnataka,
Revision Petition No.4061 of 2010, decided by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission, New Delhi, vide order dated 31.03.2011. The facts of T. Pundalika`s case (supra), were
that the complainant, with a view to sort out the controversy, with respect to his pensionary
benefits, filed an application, under the Karnataka Right to Information Act, 2002, seeking
information. The Opposite Party, in that case, failed to provide the information. The complainant
then filed a complaint, before the District Forum, which was allowed, and a direction was issued to
the Opposite Party, to furnish the required information. Feeling aggrieved, an appeal, before the
State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, was filed, which was allowed, with the
observations, that the complainant could not be considered as a consumer, as defined under the
Consumer Protection Act, 1986, since there was a remedy available to him, to approach the
Appellate Authority, under Section 19 of the Karnataka Right to Information Act, 2002. Feeling
aggrieved, against the order of the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Revision
Petition, aforesaid, was filed before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New
Delhi. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi, in the aforesaid case,
held that the appellant, could not claim himself, to be a consumer, under the Consumer Protection
Act, 1986, as there was a remedy available to him, to approach the Appellate Authority, under
Section 19 of the Right to Information Act, 2005. Similar principle of law, was laid down in
Ballarpur Industries Ltd., Vs. Eastern Railways and others, 1986-2007 Consumer 11929 (NS), a case
decided by a three Member Bench of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New
Delhi, that when the Jurisdiction of the Consumer Forum, is barred by any specific provision of
some other Act, then it had no jurisdiction, to entertain and decide the complaint, under the
Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The principle of law, laid down, in the aforesaid cases, is fully
applicable to the facts of the instant cases.
12. The third question, that falls for consideration, is, as to whether, the complainant fell within
the definition of a consumer. Nominal fee is prescribed under the relevant Rules, for seeking
information. However, if the Public Information Officer, did not supply the information, under the
Right to Information Act, 2005, the person feeling aggrieved, against her order, can file an appeal.
The Appellate Authority, while hearing the appeals, performs the quasi-Judicial functions. The
Public Information Officer performs statutory functions and, therefore, does not render any service,
to the complainant/applicant, seeking information, under the Right to Information Act, 2005. In
S.P. Goel Vs. Collector of Stamps Delhi (AIR 1996 839 (SC), it was held that the person presenting a
document, for registration, is not a consumer, within the ambit of the Consumer Protection Act, nor
the Officers appointed under the Registration and Stamp Acts, render any service to him, but, on the
other hand, they perform statutory duties, which are at least quasi-Judicial. The principle of law,
laid down, in the aforesaid case, is fully applicable to the instant case. In the present case, neither
the complainant was a consumer, nor the Opposite Parties, were service providers, nor the dispute
was a consumer dispute, and, as such, the Consumer Complaint was not maintainable.

13. The fourth question, that falls for consideration, is, as to whether, the reliefs, claimed by the
complainant in the complaint under Section 12 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, could be
granted to him, under the Right to Information Act, 2005, or not. The complainant, claimed
compensation, on account of the reason, that he underwent a lot of mental agony and physical
harassment, due to non-supply of the information, by the Public Information Officer/Opposite Party
No.2. Section 19(8)(b) of the Right to Information Act, 2005, also empowers the Central
Information Commission, or the State Information Commission, as the case may be, to require the
Public Authority, to compensate the complainant, for any loss or other detriment suffered. Section
20 of the Right to Information Act, 2005, empowers the Central Information Commission or the
State Information Commission, as the case may be, to impose penalty of two hundred and fifty
rupees, for each day, till the application(s) is/are received or information is furnished, but the total
amount of such penalty, shall not exceed twenty five thousand rupees. The reliefs, which were
claimed by the complainant, under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, were also available to him,
under Sections 19(8)(b) and 20 of the Right to Information Act, 2005. He could have availed of that
remedy, by filing first appeal, when the information was allegedly not supplied to him, and, if any
adverse order had been passed by the First Appellate Authority, under the Right to Information Act,
2005, he could file second appeal before the State Information Commission, and claim
compensation & penalty also, as indicated above. Since the Act, under which the complainant,
sought information, provided the remedy of first and second appeal, and grant of compensation and
penalty, the Jurisdiction of the District Forum, was barred, to entertain and decide the complaint,
under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The findings of the District Forum, in this regard, being
correct, are affirmed.
14. The appellant, however, placed reliance on Dr. S.P.
Thirumala Rao Vs. Municipal Commissioner Mysore City Municipal Corporation, Revision Petition
No.1975 of 2005, decided on 28.05.2009, by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission, New Delhi, to contend that he fell within the definition of a consumer, and the District
Forum had Jurisdiction, to entertain and decide the complaint. In S.P. Thirmuala Rao`s case
(supra), decided by the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi, the
provisions of the Right to Information Act, 2005, did not fall for interpretation. This case pertained
to Karnataka Right to Information Act, 2002. It is evident from the Judgment that Karnataka Right
to Information Act, 2002, does not provide for any remedy to the consumers who seek information
under the same, for deficiency of service, in the nature of compensation or damages, for not
furnishing the same (information) which they are entitled to get under the Consumer Protection Act,
1986. It was, under these circumstances that the National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission, New Delhi, held, in the aforesaid case, that the Consumer Fora, had Jurisdiction to
entertain and decide the complaint. In Right to Information Act, 2005, as held above under Section
19(8)(b), the Central Information Commission or the State Information Commission, as the case
may be, can direct the Public Authority to compensate the complainant for any loss or other
detriment suffered. Thus, the provisions of Karnataka Right to Information Act, 2002, and Right to
Information Act, 2005, with regard to the grant of compensation for deficiency, in service,
harassment, loss or detriment suffered by the complainant, are not similar and identical. The facts
of the instant case being distinguishable, the principle of law, laid down, in S.P. Thirmuala Rao`s
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/128736330/ 8Nirmal Singh Dhiman vs Financial Commissioner Revenue, ... on 1 March, 2013
case (supra), is not applicable to the same.
15. The fifth question, that falls for consideration, is, as to whether, the Right to Information Act,
2005, has overriding effect, vis-a-vis the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, or not. Section 22 of the
Right to Information Act, 2005, reads as under:-
22. Act to have overriding effect- The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding
anything inconsistent therewith contained in the Official Secrets Act, 1923 (19 of 1923), and any
other law for the time being, in force, or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other
than this Act.
The Right to Information Act, 2005, is an enactment, which is later in date, than the Consumer
Protection Act, 1986. In Maruti Udyog Ltd. Vs. Ram Lal (2005) 2 SCC 638, it was held that if both
the Statutes, contain non-obstante clause, and are special Statutes, an endeavor should be made, to
give effect to both of them. In case of conflict, the latter shall prevail. In the instant case, both the
Statutes, contain non-obstante clause. In case of conflict, the Statute enacted later in date i.e. the
Right to Information Act, 2005, shall prevail over the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, as per the
provisions of Section 22 of the Right to Information Act, 2005. It is, therefore, held that the Right to
Information Act, 2005, overrides the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.
16. In view of the above discussion, it is held that neither the complainant fell with the definition of
a consumer, nor the dispute, in question, was a consumer dispute, nor the District Forum, had
Jurisdiction to entertain and decide the complaint, as it was barred under Section 23 of the Right to
Information Act, 2005. The finding of the District Forum, that it had no Jurisdiction, to entertain
and decide the complaint, being correct, are liable to be upheld.
17. No other point, was urged, by the appellant.
18. In view of the above discussion, it is held that the order passed by the District Forum, being
based on the correct appreciation of evidence, and law, on the point, does not suffer from any
illegality or perversity, warranting the interference of this Commission.
19. For the reasons recorded above, the appeal, being devoid of merit, must fail, and the same is
dismissed, at the preliminary stage, with no order as to costs. The order of the District Forum is
upheld.
20. The appellant/complainant shall, however, be at liberty to resort any other legal remedy,
which may be available to him.
21. Certified copies of this order, be sent to the parties, free of charge.
22. The file be consigned to Record Room, after completion Pronounced.
