and
The Hon'ble Justice Siddhartha Roy Chowdhury
FA 36 of 2021
M/s Paul Rubber Industries Pvt. Ltd.
Vs.
Sri Amit Chand Mitra & Anr.
For the Appellant : Mr. Aniruddha Chatterjee, Adv.,
Mr. Rupak Ghosh, Adv.,
Mr. Abhijit Sarkar, Adv.,
Mr. Shantanu Mishra, Adv.,
Mr. B. Ghosh, Adv.
For the Respondent : Mr. Jayanta Kumar Mitra, Sr. Adv.,
Mr. Anupam Dasadhikari, Adv., Mr.Krishnendu Paul Chowdhury, Adv.
Hearing concluded on : 14th July, 2022.
Judgment on : 20th July, 2022.
Soumen Sen, J.: The appeal is arising out of a judgment and decree dated 16th July, 2012 in
connection with the Title Suit No.115 of 2008. The suit was filed by the plaintiff for eviction and was
decreed in favour of the plaintiff. The said judgment and decree is challenged, inter alia, on the
ground that the lease was for manufacturing purpose and this is terminable only by 6 month's notice
expiring with the end of the year of the tenancy. However, in the instant case the lease was
terminated by 15 day's notice expiring with the end of the month of the tenancy. No other point was
urged in support of the appeal.

There is no dispute that the defendant was put into possession by an agreement dated 27th March,
2003 for a period of 5 years for manufacturing purpose.
The plaintiff alleged that on 31st October, 2007 the said tenancy expired and the parties did not
agree for renewal thereof. The tenancy agreement shows that it is an unregistered instrument. The
question that arises for consideration is whether the terms of the said unregistered tenancy
agreement can be taken into consideration while deciding the invalidity of the notice and also for the
purpose for which the tenancy was created. The clear answer to this issue is known.
The learned Trial Judge on consideration of the provisions of Section 106 and 107 of the Transfer of
Property Act arrived at the same finding. The learned Trial Judge has also taken into consideration
the fact that although DW1 during his cross-examination has stated that the said premises was taken
for manufacturing purposes, no evidence was adduced to show that any kind of manufacturing
activity was ever carried from the suit premises. However, as rightly pointed out by the learned Trial
Judge the said evidence is not of much relevance as the terms of the said lease cannot be looked into
for the purpose of determining the rights and liabilities of the parties including the nature of activity
being carried out by the appellant in the suit premises pursuant to the agreement dated 27th March,
2003. Mr. Aniruddha Chatterjee the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of appellant has
submitted that the agreement between the parties creating tenancy would unmistakably show that
the said tenancy was for manufacturing purpose. The appellant has admitted the said fact in the
plaint and the plaintiff in fact has relied upon the said tenancy agreement in the plaint in support of
their claim for eviction of the appellant from the suit premises.
Our attention is drawn to paragraph 2, 3(i), (ii), (iii) of the plaint and recitals of the lease agreement
(clause 3 and 6 of the unregistered tenancy agreement in particular).
Mr. Chatterjee drawing our attention to the evidence of DW1 of the appellant in cross-examination
where the said witness has stated that he was doing a business of rubber, submits that this evidence
coupled with the admission of the plaintiffs in the plaint and the recitals in the tenancy agreement
adequately prove that the said property was let out for manufacturing purpose. There is a clear
mention of a factory shed in the tenancy agreement.
However, the learned Trial Judge has completely misdirected his mind and on misconception of law
and fact has erroneously held that in an absence of any proof of manufacturing activity it cannot be
said that the appellant is carrying on any manufacturing business and hence a notice of 6 months is
not required before termination of the said tenancy. Mr. Chatterjee submits that having regard to
the fact that the plaintiff has admitted that the tenancy was for manufacturing purpose there is no
requirement for the appellant to adduce any further evidence save and except what has been stated
by the appellant during its evidence. In this regard, Mr. Chatterjee has relied upon the following
decisions:
1.Joyanti Hosiery Mills & Anr. v. Upendra Chandra Das & Anr., reported in 1946 SCC

6.Bank of Baroda Ltd. v. Pubjab National Bank Ltd. & Ors.
reported in 1942 SCC Online Cal 179: AIR 1942 Cal; 562 Mr. Chatterjee relied upon the judgment of
the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Allenbury Engineers Pvt. Ltd. v. Ramkrishna Dalmia & Ors., reported
in 1973 (1) SCC 7 paragraph 3 in particular to argue that there may not be any requirement to prove
independently manufacturing process. Mr. Chatterjee submits that admittedly the tenancy was for
manufacturing purpose and the notice of termination falls short of four days for the six months
period as required under Sec. 106 of the Transfer of Property Act even if the date of filing of suit is
taken into consideration. In view of the stringent provision of the Act any such defective notice shall
be held in favour of a tenant and in support of such submission Mr. Chatterjee has relied upon the
decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Duli Chand (Dead) By LRS. vs. Jagmender Dass reported in
1990 (1) SCC 169. Per contra, Mr. Mr. Jayanta Kumar Mitra, learned Senior Counsel representing
the respondent and decree holder has submitted that there is no pleading in the written statement
making any assertion that the suit premises was let out for manufacturing purpose and any such
activity is being carried by the appellant during the subsistence of the tenancy agreement. Mr. Mitra
reminds us all of the elementary principle of pleading which is usually taught to the juniors, that a
defence has to be specifically pleaded in the written statement. If a litigant wants to make the court
believe the existence of any particular fact there has to be a foundation of such fact in the pleading
and in absence of any such foundation in the pleading no amount of oral evidence can be looked into
or adduced at the trial. Mr. Mitra submits that in fact no issue was raised due to lack of pleading by
the defendant before the trial court with regard to any manufacturing activity being carried by the
defendant/appellant from the suit premises. Mr. Mitra submits that the plaintiff has all throughout
contended that it was a monthly tenancy and the averments in the plaint would not show that the
plaintiffs have ever admitted that the lease was given for a manufacturing purpose. Even if it is
assumed for the sake of argument that it was one for such purpose, in the absence of any
manufacturing activity being carried from the premises in question it cannot be said that the lease
was for a manufacturing purpose.
Mr. Mitra has in this regard relied upon a Division bench judgment of our Court presided over by
the then Chief Justice D.N. Sinha in Messrs. Shree Nursing Timber Works and Messrs. Shee
Nursing Electric Stores v. Sm. Amala Bala Dassi reported in 73 C.W.N.522 paragraph 16 which
reads:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154167478/ 3M/S Paul Rubber Industries Pvt. Ltd vs Sri Amit Chand Mitra & Anr on 20 July, 2022
"16. It was faintly argued on behalf of the appellant in Appeal No. 251 of 1961 that the
lease was for manufacturing purpose. This obviously was done to support the
contention that the defendant was entitled to a longer notice. There is however, no
evidence that the tenancy was for a manufacturing purpose. As is well known, it is not
enough to prove that the tenant manufactures certain commodities or that the tenant
uses the premises for such manufacture. The intention of the tenant or even the
actual user of the tenant after the taking out of the tenancy are immaterial. What
must be pleaded and proved is that the tenancy agreement itself was for
manufacturing purpose. There is no evidence on record on this point and we have no
hesitation in rejecting this contention of the appellant." (emphasis supplied) The
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in C. Mackertich v.
Steuart & Co. Ltd. Reported in 1971 (3) SCC 39 paragraph 3 has been placed for the
same proposition which reads:
"3. In support of these appeals it was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the
High Court was in error in holding that the tenancy was for manufacturing purpose
and that six months' notice terminable with a year of tenancy was required. It was
said that the onus of proving that the tenancy was for manufacturing purpose was
upon the defendant and as that point was not raised in the written statement the
High Court should not have allowed the respondent to raise the question. In our
opinion there is substance in this argument. But we shall assume in favour of the
respondent that such an objection could have been taken by it even without a specific
plea in the written statement. Even upon that assumption we are of opinion that
there is no evidence in the case to support the finding of the High Court that' the
purpose of the lease was dominantly for manufacturing purpose. Exhibit W is the
Memorandum and Articles of Association. The objects of the company are given in
paragraphs 3 and 4 and are to the following effect:
(3) To carry on the business of motor-cab, motor-car, motor-omnibus, motor-boat
and motor-van proprietors, motor-engineers, manufacturers, builders, painters,
decorators, and repairers of motor cars, cabs, omnibuses, vans and other vehicles of
every description so constructed as to progress whether on land or water or in the air.
(4) To carry on the business of harness-makers and wheel-wrights, mechanical
engineers and manufacturers of and dealers in lamps, whips, rugs, leather goods,
India-rubber goods, wheels, springs, axles, upholsterings, India-rubber tyres and all
component parts of any carriage or vehicle and other articles used in the manufacture
or fitting up of the above mentioned or any similar articles, and manufacturers or
factors of or dealers in all products or substances which may be used in or in
connection with the said business or any of them or in which it may be considered
advantageous to deal." It cannot be said from these paragraphs that the object of the
company was dominantly manufacturing purpose. The High Court has in this
connection referred to the evidence of Mr. J.N. Ghose, the Managing Director of the
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154167478/ 4M/S Paul Rubber Industries Pvt. Ltd vs Sri Amit Chand Mitra & Anr on 20 July, 2022
defendant company. In reply to question 235 the witness said that the company had
business as "Automobile engineers, coach builders, refrigerators, motor, mechanical
engineer, body builders and the like and that business is continuing". In answer to
question No. 247 the witness said that the company had agency to deal in Austin cars.
It is true that in the registered lease deed Ex. L and L (I) there is the description of
the lessee as coach-builder. But it is obvious that the defendant company cannot
claim to be holding under the registered lease deed Ex. L and L (I) and so the purpose
mentioned in the lease deed cannot be taken into consideration. In our opinion
neither the evidence of Mr. J.N. Ghose nor the statement in Ex. W, Memorandum
and Articles of Association, can be taken as sufficient evidence to prove that the
purpose of the lease was exclusively or even dominantly for a manufacturing purpose.
It follows, therefore, that the High Court was in error in holding that the dominant
purpose of the lease was manufacture and so 15 days' notice ending with the month of
each tenancy must be held to be insufficient." (emphasis supplied) Mr. Mitra, the
learned Senior Counsel submits that in absence of any registered agreement between
the parties the terms of the said lease would not be looked into and the said
unregistered lease should be treated to be a lease month by month determinable with
a notice of 15 days. Mr. Mitra in this regard has relied upon the decision of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in Anthony v. K.C. Ittoop & Sons & Anr., reported in 2000
(6) SCC 394 paragraphs 11, 12 and 13 which reads:
"11. The resultant position is insurmountable that so far as the instrument of lease is
concerned there is no scope for holding that the appellant is a lessee by virtue of the
said instrument. The court is disabled from using the instrument as evidence and
hence it goes out of consideration in this case, hook, line and sinker (vide Smt.
Shantabai v. State of Bombay, Satish Chand Makhan v. Govardhan Das Byas and
Bajaj Auto Limited v. Behari Lal Kohli.
12. But the above finding does not exhaust the scope of the issue whether the
appellant is a lessee of the building. A lease of immovable property is defined in
Section 105 of the TP Act. A transfer of a right to enjoy a property in consideration of
a price paid or promised to be rendered periodically or on specified occasions is the
basic fabric for a valid lease. The provision says that such a transfer can be made
expressly or by implication. Once there is such a transfer of right to enjoy the
property a lease stands created. What is mentioned in the three paragraphs of the
first part of Section 107 of the TP Act are only the different modes of how leases are
created. The first paragraph has been extracted above and it deals with the mode of
creating the particular kinds of leases mentioned therein. The third paragraph can be
read along with the above as it contains a condition to be complied with if the parties
choose to create a lease as per a registered instrument mentioned therein. All other
leases, if created, necessarily fall within the ambit of the second paragraph. Thus,
dehors the instrument parties can create a lease as envisaged in the second paragraph
of Section 107 which reads thus:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154167478/ 5M/S Paul Rubber Industries Pvt. Ltd vs Sri Amit Chand Mitra & Anr on 20 July, 2022
"All other leases of immovable property may be made either by a registered
instrument or by oral agreement accompanied by delivery of possession."
13. When lease is a transfer of a right to enjoy the property and such transfer can be made expressly
or by implication, the mere fact that an unregistered instrument came into existence would not
stand in the way of the court to determine whether there was in fact a lease otherwise than through
such deed."
In order to appreciate the submission made on behalf of the parties it is necessary to briefly refer to
the pleadings and evidences. Mr. Chatterjee has relied upon paragraph 2, 3(i) (ii) and (iii) of the
plaint to argue that there is an admission of the plaintiff and Clauses 3 and 6 of the Tenancy
Agreement in support of his contention that the lease was for a manufacturing purpose and the said
fact is admitted from the pleadings and documents. For the purpose of convenience paragraph 2 and
paragraph 3 are reproduced below:
"2. By an agreement dated 27th day of March, 2003 entered into between the plaintiff
therein referred to as the landlady of the one part and the defendant of the other part,
whereby the defendant was inducted as a lessee/tenant in respect of the piece and
parcel of land measuring about 16 cottahs be the same a little more or less together
with a shed/go down space measuring about 6000 Sq. ft. approx and an office space
measuring about 1000 Sq. ft. at the said premises with a 20 feet wide common
passage on the north for ingress and egress more fully described in the schedule
hereunder (hereinafter referred to as the said tenanted premises) for commercial
purpose at a rental of Rs.20,000/- per month payable according to the English
calendar month to the plaintiff.
3. The said tenancy was granted on the terms and condition as follows:-
i.) The tenancy shall commence on and from the First day of November, 2002 and
shall continue for a period of 5 (five) years with the provisions of further renewal of
5(five) years and thereafter for such period and on such terms and conditions as may
be agreed upon by the parties. Such renewal shall only be upon the mutual agreement
of both the parties herein.
ii) The plaintiff will accord her consent as and when the defendant shall apply for
Electric Meter before the competent authority in its own name and/or in the name of
company. The defendant shall remain responsible for payment of the energy charges
consumed through such meter/meters and also of any other meter that may be used
by the defendant in the tenanted premises.
iii) The defendant shall affix all electric gadgets, plant and machinery, apparatus
according to his need for which the plaintiff shall not raise any objection. Subject to
the condition that the tenant shall restore the original condition of the demise at the
time of vacating the same by way of surrender of tenancy and on such surrender shall
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154167478/ 6M/S Paul Rubber Industries Pvt. Ltd vs Sri Amit Chand Mitra & Anr on 20 July, 2022
deliver the vacant and peaceful possession of the demise premises to the plaintiff in
the position and condition in which the demised premises had been let out and the
defendant shall be liable to make all such repairs and incur all such expenses which
might be necessary for restoration of such original condition of the demised
premises."
It is also necessary to reproduce Clause 3 and Clause 6 of the Tenancy Agreement dated 7th March,
2003.
"3. That the Tenancy comprising of A schedule premises of which includes a factory
Shed will be used by the Party of the Other Part for the purpose of his business
and/or factory.
6. That the party of the OTHER PART shall affix all electric gadgets, Plant and
Machinery, apparatus according to his need for which the Party of the ONE PART
shall not raise any objection. Subject to the condition that the tenant shall restore the
original conditition of the demised premises at the time of vacating the same by way
of surrender of tenancy and on such surrender shall deliver the vacant and peaceful
possession of the demised premises to the party of the ONE PART in the position and
condition in which the demised premises had been let out and the party of the
OTHER PART shall be liable to make all such repairs and incur all such expenses
which might be necessary for restoration of such original condition of the demised
premises."
The pleadings and the unregistered agreement shows that the appellant was in search of a factory's
space and the tenancy was created in favour of the appellant comprising of land and factory shed
fully described in Schedule 'A' to the agreement that shall be used by the appellant for setting up a
factory. He was permitted to affix all electrical gadgets. The plaintiff in order to prove the
relationship between the parties has made necessary averments which inter alia include the
aforesaid paragraphs. It was primarily on the basis of a short notice of four days that a defence was
set up by the appellants in the suit and the appeal dragged for almost eight years. In the written
statement the defendant has categorically stated that the agreement of lease is unregistered and the
suit is not maintainable based on the said document. On the same breath the appellant contended
that the defendant was assured of a renewal by the plaintiff. The defendant was a lessee under the
plaintiff on the strength of the aforesaid agreement. However, there is no whisper in the said written
statement or in its affidavit in chief that the appellant/defendant is carrying on any manufacturing
activity from the said premises.
First, we discuss the effect of an unregistered lease agreement. Section 105 of the Transfer of
Property Act defines lease. Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act (hereinafter referred as to the
"said Act") provides the manner in which a lease of an immovable property is required to be made.
The said Section reads as follows:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154167478/ 7M/S Paul Rubber Industries Pvt. Ltd vs Sri Amit Chand Mitra & Anr on 20 July, 2022
"107. Leases how made.-- A lease of immovable property from year to year, or for any
term exceeding one year or reserving a yearly rent, can be made only by a registered
instrument.
All other leases of immovable property may be made either by a registered
instrument or by oral agreement accompanied by delivery of possession. Where a
lease of immoveable property is made by a registered instrument, such instrument
or, where there are more instruments than one, each such instrument shall be
executed by both the lessor and the lessee:
Provided that the State Government may from time to time, by notification in the
Official Gazette, direct that leases of immoveable property, other than leases from
year to year, or for any term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent, or any
class of such leases, may be made by unregistered instrument or by oral agreement
without delivery of possession."
Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act inter alia, provides that in absence of a contract or local
law or usage to the contrary, a lease of immovable property for agricultural or manufacturing
purposes, shall be deemed to be lease from year to year and that a lease of an immovable property
for any other purpose shall be deemed to be lease from month to month.
The said Section prescribes the procedure for making of a lease between the parties mentioned
therein. It classifies the classes of lease in two categories. Mainly, (i) A lease of immovable property
from year to year, or for a term exceeding a year, or lease reserving a yearly rent, to be made by a
registered document; and (ii) All other leases other than the above, to be made by registered
instrument, or the said lease to be made by an oral agreement accompanied by delivery of
possession.
It thus makes clear that all the leases of immovable property not covered in the second category
shall have to be necessarily made by a registered instrument only.
The effect of non registration of a lease deed is inadmissible in evidence. Section 17 (1)(d) of the
Registration Act, 1908 provides that leases of immovable property from year to year, or for any term
exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent have to be necessarily registered. Section 49 of the
same Act, inter alia, provides that no instrument which is compulsorily required to be registered
shall affect any immovable property comprised therein, or confer any power to adopt, or be received
as evidence of any transaction affecting such property or conferring such power, unless it has been
registered. However, an unregistered document affecting immovable property and required by the
Registration Act or the Transfer of Property Act to be registered, may be received as evidence of any
collateral transaction not required to be effected by registered instrument.
The principle was reiterated by the Supreme Court in Sevoke Properties Ltd. v. West Bengal State
Electricity Distribution Company Ltd., Reported in 2020 (11) SCC 782, where it observed as under:
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154167478/ 8M/S Paul Rubber Industries Pvt. Ltd vs Sri Amit Chand Mitra & Anr on 20 July, 2022
"13. In terms of the provisions of Section 107, a lease of immovable property for a
term exceeding one year can only be made by a registered instrument. Admittedly, in
the present case, the indenture of lease has not been registered. In consequence, the
contents of the indenture would be inadmissible in evidence for the purpose of
determining the terms of the contract between the parties. This is the plain
consequence of the provisions of Sections 17 and 49 of the Registration Act, 1908.
The only purpose for which the lease can be looked at is for assessing the nature and
character of the possession of the respondent."
The unregistered lease of an immovable property is inadmissible but for collateral purpose. The
essential terms of the lease cannot be treated as for collateral purpose. The recitals of an
unregistered lease cannot be used for collateral purpose and at best can be used to explain the
character of possession of a person holding the property on a month to month tenancy liable to be
evicted after notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act.
The Full Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Ulfatunnissa v Hosain Khan reported in 1883 ILR (9)
Cal 520 has held the words 'no document required by Section 17 to be registered shall be received as
evidence of any transaction affecting immovable property' to mean that no document required by
section 17 to be registered shall be received as evidence of any transaction so far as it affects
immovable property.
An unregistered deed cannot be used to prove the term of a lease as held in Satish Chand Makhan v.
Goverdhandas Byas reported in AIR 1984 SC 143.
The period of tenancy is an essential requisite of a valid lease. Accordingly, an unregistered lease
deed cannot be looked into for purposes of period of tenancy. In respect of the leases classified in
first category under Section 106 of the Act it requires compulsory registration for making of a lease
in law under Section 107 of the said Act and if not so registered, the said instrument cannot be used
for the purpose of establishing that it created, declared, assigned, limited or extinguished any right
to the property comprised in the said document, and the said document can only create a month to
month tenancy or year to year depending upon the purpose for which it is made.
In Samir Mukherjee v. Davinder Kumar Bajaj, reported in 2001(5) SCC 259 and AIR 2001 SC 1969
the Hon'ble Supreme Court noticed the interplay between Section 106 and 107 of the Transfer of
Property Act in the following words:
"5. Section 106 lays down a rule of construction, which is to apply when the parties
have not specifically agreed upon as to whether the lease is yearly or monthly
between the parties. On a plain reading of this section it is clear that legislature has
classified leases in two categories according to their purposes and this section would
be attracted to construe the duration of a valid lease in the absence of a contract or
local law or usage to the contrary. Where the parties by a contract have indicated the
duration of a lease; this section would not apply. What this section does is to
prescribe the duration of the period of different kinds of leases by legal fiction leases
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154167478/ 9M/S Paul Rubber Industries Pvt. Ltd vs Sri Amit Chand Mitra & Anr on 20 July, 2022
for agricultural or manufacturing purposes shall be deemed to be lease from year to
year and all other leases shall be deemed to be from month to month. Existence of a
valid lease is a pre-requisite to invoke the rule of construction embodied in Section
106 of Transfer of Property Act. Section 107 prescribes the procedure for execution of
a lease between the parties. Under the first paragraph of this section a lease of
immovable property from year to year or for any term exceeding one year or
reserving yearly rent can be made only by registered instrument and remaining
classes of leases are governed by the second paragraph that is to say all other leases of
immovable property can be made either by registered instrument or by oral
agreement accompanied by delivery of possession".
In Sri Janki Devi Bhagat Trust, Agra v. Ram Swarup Jain, reported in 1995(5) SCC 314: AIR 1995 SC
2482, it has been clearly stated that a lease of immovable property from year to year or for a term
exceeding one year can be made only by a registered instrument. In Shri Janki Devi Bhagat Trust,
Agra (supra) a lease agreement was in existence though unregistered and where-under the monthly
rent payable was of Rs.75/- p.m. The tenancy was terminated by a thirty days notice. The defendants
pleaded that the lease was for manufacturing purpose consequently, six months' notice was required
to terminate the lease. The High Court accepted the plea of the defendant and held that although the
lease was unregistered but since it was not for a term exceeding one year, it was not compulsorily
registerable under the first part of Section 107. It was also held that since the lease was for
manufacturing purpose, six months notice was required to terminate the tenancy. The reasoning
given by the High Court was not approved by the Supreme Court, by holding thus:-
"4. Under Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act a lease of immovable property
from year to year of for any term exceeding one year can be made only by a registered
instrument. Any lease of this kind would be void unless it is created by a registered
instrument. All other leases of immovable property may be made either by a
registered instrument or by an oral agreement accompanied by delivery of
possession. All the courts below have held that there was a valid lease. The high court
has also recorded that it was not the contention of the respondent that his lease was
from year to year. The contention was that the lease was for a term exceeding one
year and was, therefore, compulsorily registerable under the first part of section 107
of the Transfer of Property Act. This contention has been negative by the High Court
as also by both the courts below. The High Court has held that the lease was not for a
term exceeding one year, and so was not compulsorily registerable under the first
part of Section
107. It, however, held that since the lease was for a manufacturing purpose, six
months' notice to quit was required under section 106. In its absence, termination
was not valid.
5. This reasoning is fallacious. It is true that Ex.12 which is not registered cannot be
looked at because it is not registered. But the factum of lease is not in dispute. All the
courts have held that it was a lease from month to month and was not for a term
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154167478/ 10M/S Paul Rubber Industries Pvt. Ltd vs Sri Amit Chand Mitra & Anr on 20 July, 2022
exceeding one year. In view of this finding, the deeming provisions of the first part of
section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act cannot be attracted in the present case."
In Payal Vision Ltd., v. Radhika Choudhary, reported in 2012(11) SCC 405 it has been held that in a
suit for recovery of a possession from a tenant whose tenancy is not protected under the provisions
of the said Rent Control Act, all that is required to be established by the plaintiff landlord is the
existence of the jural relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties and the termination of
the tenancy either by lapse of time or by notice served by the landlord under Section 106 of the
Transfer of Property Act.
The requirement of a registered instrument to established the right under a lease deed of an
immovable property has been reiterated in Park Street Properties Pvt. Ltd v. Dipak Kumar Singh,
reported in 2016(9) SCC 268 at paragraph 17 and 19 which were reproduced for better
understanding of the issue involved:
"17. A perusal of Section 106 of the Act makes it clear that it creates a deemed
monthly tenancy in those cases where there is no express contract to the contrary,
which is terminable at a notice period of 15 days. The section also lays down the
requirements of a valid notice to terminate the tenancy, such as that it must be in
writing, signed by the person sending it and be duly delivered. Admittedly, the
validity of the notice itself is not under challenge. The main contention advanced on
behalf of the respondents is that the impugned judgment and order is valid in light of
the second part of Section 107 of the Act, which requires that lease for a term
exceeding one year can only be made by way of a registered instrument.
19. It is also a well settled position of law that in the absence of a registered
instrument, the courts are not precluded from determining the factum of tenancy
from the other evidence on record as well as the conduct of the parties. A three Judge
bench of this Court in the case of Anthony v. KC Ittoop & Sons (4), held as under:
"A lease of immovable property is defined in Section 105 of the TP Act. A transfer of a
right to enjoy a property in consideration of a price paid or promised to be rendered
periodically or on specified occasions is the basic fabric for a valid lease. The
provision says that such a transfer can be made expressly or by implication. Once
there is such a transfer of right to enjoy the property a lease stands created. What is
mentioned in the three paragraphs of the first part of Section 107 of the TP Act are
only the different modes of how leases are created. The first paragraph has been
extracted above and it deals with the mode of creating the particular kinds of leases
mentioned therein. The third paragraph can be read along with the above as it
contains a condition to be complied with if the parties choose to create a lease as per
a registered instrument mentioned therein. All other leases, if created, necessarily fall
within the ambit of the second paragraph. Thus, dehors the instrument parties can
create a lease as envisaged in the second paragraph of Section 107 which reads thus:
"107. A lease of immoveable property from year to year, or for any term exceeding
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154167478/ 11M/S Paul Rubber Industries Pvt. Ltd vs Sri Amit Chand Mitra & Anr on 20 July, 2022
one year, or reserving a yearly rent, can be made only by a registered instrument.
1[All other leases of immoveable property may be made either by a registered
instrument or by oral agreement accompanied by delivery of possession.
2[Where a lease of immoveable property is made by a registered instrument, such
instrument or, where there are more instruments than one, each such instrument
shall be executed by both the lessor and the lessee:] Provided that the State
Government may, 3[***] from time to time, by notification in the Official Gazette,
direct that leases of immoveable property, other than leases from year to year, or for
any term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent, or any class of such leases,
may be made by unregistered instrument or by oral agreement without delivery of
possession.]"
13. When lease is a transfer of a right to enjoy the property and such transfer can be made expressly
or by implication, the mere fact that an unregistered instrument came into existence would not
stand in the way of the court to determine whether there was in fact a lease otherwise than through
such deed.
16. Taking a different view would be contrary to the reality when parties clearly intended to create a
lease though the document which they executed had not gone into the processes of registration. That
lacuna had affected the validity of the document, but what had happened between the parties in
respect of the property became a reality. Non registration of the document had caused only two
consequences. One is that no lease exceeding one year was created. Second is that the instrument
became useless so far as creation of the lease is concerned. Nonetheless the presumption that a lease
not exceeding one year stood created by conduct of parties remains un- rebutted." (emphasis laid by
this court) Thus, in the absence of registration of a document, what is deemed to be created is a
month to month tenancy, the termination of which is governed by Section 106 of the Act." (emphasis
supplied) The effect of a compulsorily registrable lease, if not registered, was also explained by the e
Delhi High Court in Deluxe Dentelles Pvt. Ltd. v. Ishpinder Kochhar reported in 2015 SCC OnLine
Del 14507 as under:
"21. A lease granted for any purpose, be it residential, commercial, manufacturing or
agricultural, can be made only by a registered instrument if duration of the lease is
for the period stated in the first paragraph of Section 107 of the Transfer of Property
Act, 1882. But, a lease for the same purpose(s) of a lesser duration can be made,
under the second paragraph, either by a registered instrument or by an oral
agreement accompanied by delivery of possession.
22. If one looks to Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act it becomes evident that
the classification of leases is according to their purpose. Section 106 classifies leases
of immovable property for agricultural and manufacturing purposes in one class and
all other leases in different class.

23. Sub-section (1) of Section 106 is a deeming provision as per which, in the absence
of a contract or local law or usage to the contrary, a lease of immovable property for
agricultural or manufacturing purposes shall be deemed to be a lease from year to
year. Thus, where the parties have themselves indicated the duration of the lease
relatable to agricultural or manufacturing purposes, sub-section (1) of Section 106 of
the Transfer of Property Act would be redundant. This is evident from the fact that
sub- section (1) of Section 106 operates only "in the absence of a contract.....to the
contrary".
24. Pertaining to leases, excluding leases for agricultural or manufacturing purposes, the legal
fiction created in the second paragraph of sub-section (1) of Section 106 is to deem the leases to be
from month to month. Of course, this deeming provision would also be 'in the absence of a
contract....to the contrary'.
25. In the present case, the defendants have admitted the jural relationship of landlord and tenant
between the plaintiff and Defendant 1. As per both plaintiff and defendants, Defendant 1 was
inducted as a tenant in the suit premises by virtue of unregistered lease-deed dated November 21,
1999 for a period of eleven years and eleven months.
26. The case (defence) set up by the defendants is that notwithstanding the fact that the lease-deed
dated November 21, 1999 executed between the parties is an unregistered document, the tenancy of
Defendant 1was not from month to month but for a period of eleven years and eleven months with
an option to Defendant 1 to renew the lease by another period of eleven years inasmuch as
Defendant. 1 had paid rent in advance to Ms. Neeta Mehra, erstwhile owner of the suit premises for
a period of fourteen years approximately at the time when it was inducted in the suit premises.
* * *
30. In view of afore-noted authoritative pronouncement of law laid down by Supreme Court in Ram
Kumar's case (supra), the answer to the question posed above is: tenancy of immovable property for
any purpose other than agricultural or manufacturing created by an unregistered instrument would
be deemed to be 'month to month' tenancy even where the tenant has paid annual/yearly rent to the
landlord.
31. As a necessary corollary thereof, the tenancy of Defendant 1 in suit premises is deemed to be
'month to month' tenancy which could be terminated by giving 15 days' notice. (We again note here
that Defendant 1 has admitted the receipt of legal notice dated May 03, 2010 issued by the plaintiff
terminating the tenancy of Defendant 1)."
14. The High Court of Delhi in Sanjay Gupta v. Krishna Hospitality reported in
MANU/DE/1749/2018 observed as under:
"11. Per Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, a lease of immovable
property for any term exceeding one year can be made only by a registered
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154167478/ 13M/S Paul Rubber Industries Pvt. Ltd vs Sri Amit Chand Mitra & Anr on 20 July, 2022
instrument and all other leases may be made either by registered instrument
executed by the lessor and lessee or by oral agreement accompanied with delivery of
possession. The defendants in their written statement have pleaded lease agreement
dated 23rd November, 2015, for a period of three years, executed by plaintiff and
defendants and where under claim to be entitled to occupy premises till 31st October,
2018. The same is not registered and is admitted to be not registered. The same thus,
under Section 49 of Registration Act, 1908, cannot be received in evidence of any
transaction effecting such property. Per Section 106 of Transfer of Property Act, in
the absence of registered lease deed, a lease of immovable property for any purpose
other than agricultural or marketing, is deemed to be a lease from month to month,
terminable by a fifteen days' notice..."
The result and effect of all these discussions is that there is no scope for holding that the appellant is
a lessee by virtue of the said unregistered agreement as felicitously expressed by Justice K.T.
Thomas in Anthony (supra):
"11.......... The court is disabled from using the instrument as evidence and hence it
goes out of consideration in this case, hook, line and sinker (vide Shantabai v. State of
Bombay, Satish Chand Makhan v. Govardhan Das Byas and Bajaj Auto Ltd. V. Behari
Lal Kohli)."
The cumulative effect of Sections 106 and 107 of the Transfer of Property Act, Sections 17 and 19 of
the Registration Act is that an unregistered lease deed cannot be looked into for the purpose of
deciding the rights and liabilities of the lessors and lessees and for its duration. The very lease in the
instant case must be treated as month to month tenancy terminable at 15 days notice expiring with
the end of the month of the tenancy.
Now we come to the question of manufacturing purpose although we feel that the said question need
not to be gone into at all as the tenancy agreement is unregistered and except for the collateral
purpose the lease deed cannot be looked into. The essential terms of the lease are beyond our
scrutiny. However, since argument has been advanced on manufacturing purpose for which the
tenancy agreement is claimed to have been executed we discuss briefly our reasons for not accepting
the argument of Mr. Chatterjee on this point.
In the written statement the defendant did not raise any plea or set up any defence that the lease
was for manufacturing purpose. All that the tenancy agreement says is that the appellant wanted a
factory space and the appellant was provided with the factory space for setting up a factory. That
does not by itself make the lease a lease for manufacturing purpose unless the appellant is able to
establish that a manufacturing activity is being carried from the suit premises. There is no proof of
setting up any factory by the appellant for carrying on any manufacturing process. The onus of
proving that the tenancy was for manufacturing purpose was upon the defendant as observed in C.
Mackertich (supra). In M/s. Shree Nursing Timber (supra) the then Chief Justice Sinha in his
Lordship's inimitable style has dealt with this issue in Paragraph 16. The said decision emphasizes
the cardinal principle that there has to be a pleading supported by evidence to prove that there is a
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154167478/ 14M/S Paul Rubber Industries Pvt. Ltd vs Sri Amit Chand Mitra & Anr on 20 July, 2022
manufacturing purpose. The said principle was reiterated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Shivaji
Balaram Haibatti v. Avinash Maruthi Pawar reported in 2018 (11) SCC 652 paragraph 24 which
reads as:
"24. First, the Respondent (Defendant) had not raised such plea in his written
statement. In other words, the Respondent did not set up such defense in the written
statement. Second, the Trial Court, therefore, had no occasion to frame any issue on
such plea for want of any factual foundation in the written statement. Third, the Trial
Court and First Appellate Court, in these circumstances, had no occasion to record
any finding on this plea either way. Fourth, in the light of these three reasonings, the
High Court ought to have seen that such plea really did not arise for consideration
because in order that any question is involved in the case, the party concerned should
lay its factual foundation in the pleading and invite finding on such plea. Fifth, the
High Court failed to see the case set up by the Respondent in his written statement.
As mentioned above, the defense of the Respondent was that he had denied the
Appellant's title over the suit shop and then set up a plea of adverse possession
contending that he has become the owner of the suit shop by virtue of adverse
possession, which according to him, was from time immemorial."
In absence of any pleading the Trial court did not frame any issue. In order to establish that the
notice is defective the onus on the defendant to prove that it was a manufacturing purpose and
manufacturing activities has been carried on from the suit premises. In fact one of the judgments
relied upon Mr. Chatterjee namely, Allenburry (supra) clearly emphasize the need for a pleading and
proof of "manufacturing purpose" in paragraph 6 and 7 of the said report which reads:
"6. In these circumstances, two questions were sought to be raised by Mr. Chagla.
The first was that there being no dispute between the parties that the relationship
between them was that of landlord and tenant and the respondents having accepted
all along the said rent of Rs. 1800/- a month, the Court must proceed upon the basis
that the occupation of the premises by the appellant-company was in the capacity as a
tenant. According to him, if the appellant-company, can establish that, that tenancy
was for manufacturing purposes, the presumption laid down in Section 106 of the
Transfer of Property Act, under which such tenancy has to be regarded as a tenancy
from year to year terminable by a six months' notice and not by a month's notice,
must apply. It is true, said he, that Under Section 107 of the Act a lease from year to
year can be made only by a registered instrument, but that provision in no way
controls the presumption laid down in Section 106 under which once it is proved 'that
the parties were in the position of a landlord and a tenant and the tenancy was for
manufacturing purposes, it has to be presumed to be 'one from year to year.
According to him, the two sections are independent of each other, the one dealing
with the user and notice, and the presumption arising from such user, and the other
dealing with compulsory registration for a lease from year to year, or for a term
exceeding one year. Mr. Tarkunde, appearing for the Corporation, on the other hand,
disputed the construction of these two sections suggested by Mr. Chagla. The second
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/154167478/ 15M/S Paul Rubber Industries Pvt. Ltd vs Sri Amit Chand Mitra & Anr on 20 July, 2022
question raised by Mr. Chagla was that in any event the lease was for manufacturing
purposes, and therefore, the said notice was not valid. Assuming that Mr. Chagla is
right in the interpretation of Sections 106 and 107 suggested by him, even then the
appellant-company has first to establish that the lease in its favour was for
manufacturing purposes and it is then only that it can take advantage of the rule of
presumption laid down in Section 106.
7. The expression 'manufacturing purposes' in Section 106 is used in its popular and
dictionary meaning, the Transfer of Property Act not having supplied any dictionary
of its own for that expression. The burden of proving that the lease was for
manufacturing purposes, must for the purposes of Section 106 of the Transfer of
Property Act, lie on the party who claims it to be so, in the present case the
appellant-company. That burden is to establish that the exclusive or at least the
dominant purpose of the lease was the manufacturing purpose. [C. Mackertich v.
Steuart & Co. Ltd reported in AIR 1970 SC 839]."
The aforesaid judgment has discussed the meaning of the expression "manufacturing purposes" in
Section 106 in great detail. The said expression was held to mean purposes for making or fabricating
articles or materials by physical labour or skill or by mechanical power, vendible and useful as such.
It involves transformation of an existing article into a different article or material having a distinct
name, character or use of fabricating a previously known article by a novel process.
The said paragraphs clearly have laid down the principle that the burden of proof that the lease was
one of manufacturing purpose must lie on the party claiming to establish such fact. Although the
appellant had the opportunity to produce evidence to show that after the appellant was put to
possession it had set up a factory and carried on manufacturing activities the appellant did not
adduce any evidence in this regard. The best evidence available with the appellant has been withheld
and accordingly an adverse interference should be drawn against the appellant. On such
consideration, we do not find any reason to interfere with the judgment and order passed by the
learned Trial Judge. The decree is upheld.
During the pendency of the appeal the appellant was directed to pay occupational charges at the rate
of Rs.40,000/- per month since April, 2013 till the disposal of the appeal. The appeal was, however,
dismissed for default. It is alleged by the appellant that after the dismissal of the appeal the
respondent/decree holder refused to accept the occupation charges in terms of the order dated 10th
April, 2013. However, subsequent order of the co-ordinate bench on 27th January, 2022 directed
the appellant to pay a sum of Rs.11 lacs towards arrears occupation charges for the aforesaid period.
Thereafter apparently no occupation charges have been paid by the appellant. In spite of assurance
being given by the appellant to furnish the period for which the said sum of Rs.11 lacs was deposited
no such information, however, was furnished. Considering the fact that the occupation charges was
fixed at the rate of Rs.40,000/- in the year 2013 in respect of 16 cottahs of land in a prime locality
and the price of land has gone up substantially we direct the appellant to pay a further sum of Rs.6
lacs towards occupation charges within four weeks from the date subject to the final determination
of mesne profits.
