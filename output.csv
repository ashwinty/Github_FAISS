65aa8ee72315441eab5e47d0,319040177,blockchain-technology,"Blockchain and AI are on just about every chief information officers watchlist of game-changing technologies that stand to reshape industries. Both technologies come with immense benefits, but both also bring their own challenges for adoption. It is also fair to say that the hype surrounding these technologies individually may be unprecedented, so the thought of bringing these two ingredients together may be viewed by some as brewing a modern-day version of IT pixie dust. At the same time, there is a logical way to think about this mash-up that is both sensible and pragmatic.  Today, AI is for all intents and purposes a centralized process. An end user must have extreme faith in the central authority to produce a trusted business outcome. By decentralizing the three key elements of AI ‚Äî that is, data, models, and analytics ‚Äî blockchain can deliver the trust and confidence often needed for end users to fully adopt and rely on AI-based business processes. Let‚Äôs explore how blockchain is poised to enrich AI by bringing trust to data, models and analytics.  Your data is your data Many of the world‚Äôs most notable AI technology services are centralized ‚Äî including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, as well as Chinese companies Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent. Yet all have encountered challenges in establishing trust among their eager, but somewhat cautious users. How can a business provide assurance to its users that its AI has not overstepped its bounds?  Imagine if these AI services could produce a ‚Äúforensic report,‚Äù verified by a third party, to prove to you, beyond a reasonable doubt, how and when businesses are using your data once those are ingested. Imagine further that your data could be used only if you gave permission to do so.  A blockchain ledger can be used as a digital rights management system, allowing your data to be ‚Äúlicensed‚Äù to the AI provider under your terms, conditions and duration. The ledger would act as an access management system storing the proofs and permission by which a business can access and use the user‚Äôs data.  Trusted AI models Consider the example of using blockchain technology as a means of providing trusted data and provenance of training models for machine learning. In this case, we‚Äôve created a fictitious system to answer the question of whether a fruit is an apple or orange.  This question-answering system that we build is called a model, and this model is created via a process called training. The goal of training is to create an accurate model that answers our questions correctly most of the time. Of course, to train a model, we need to collect data to train on ‚Äî for this example, that could be the color of the fruit (as a wavelength of light) and the sugar content (as a percentage).  With blockchain, you can track the provenance of the training data as well as see an audit trail of the evidence that led to the prediction of why a particular fruit is considered an apple versus an orange. A business can also prove that it is not ‚Äújuicing up‚Äù its books by tagging fruit more often as apples, if that is the more expensive of the two fruits.  Explaining AI decisions The European Union has adopted a law requiring that any decision made by a machine be readily explainable, on penalty of fines that could cost companies billions of dollars. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force in 2018, includes a right to obtain an explanation of decisions made by algorithms and a right to opt out of some algorithmic decisions altogether.  Massive amounts of data are being produced every second ‚Äî more data than humans have the ability to assess and use as the basis for drawing conclusions. However, AI applications are capable of assessing large data sets and many variables, while learning about or connecting those variables relevant to its tasks and objectives. For this very reason, AI continues to be adopted in various industries and applications, and we are relying more and more on their outcomes. It is essential, however, that any decisions made by AI are still verified for accuracy by humans.  Blockchain can help clarify the provenance, transparency, understanding, and explanations of those outcomes and decisions. If decisions and associated data points are recorded via transactions on a blockchain, the inherent attributes of blockchain will make auditing them much simpler. Blockchain is a key technology that brings trust to transactions in a network; therefore, infusing blockchain into AI decision-making processes could be the element needed to achieve the transparency necessary to fully trust the decisions and outcomes derived from AI.  Blockchain and the Internet of Things More than a billion intelligent, connected devices are already part of today‚Äôs IoT. The expected proliferation of hundreds of billions more places us at the threshold of a transformation sweeping across the electronics industry and many other areas.  With the advancement in IoT, industries are now enabled to capture data, gain insight from the data, and make decisions based on the data. Therefore, there is a lot of ‚Äútrust‚Äù in the information obtained. But the real truth of the matter is, do we really know where these data came from and should we be making decisions and transacting based on data we cannot validate?  For example, did weather data really originate from a censor in the Atlantic Ocean or did the shipping container really not exceed the agreed temperature limit? The IoT use cases are massive, but they all share the same issue with trust.  IoT with blockchain can bring real trust to captured data. The underlying idea is to give devices, at the time of their creation, an identity that can be validated and verified throughout their lifecycle with blockchain. There is great potential for IoT systems in blockchain technology capabilities that rely on device identity protocols and reputation systems. With a device identity protocol, each device can have its own blockchain public key and send encrypted challenge and response messages to other devices, thereby ensuring a device remains in control of its identity. In addition, a device with an identity can develop a reputation or history that is tracked by a blockchain.  Smart contracts represent the business logic of a blockchain network. When a transaction is proposed, these smart contracts are autonomously executed within the guidelines set by the network. In IoT networks, smart contracts can play a pivotal role by providing automated coordination and authorization for transactions and interactions. The original idea behind IoT was to surface data and gain actionable insight at the right time.  For example, smart homes are a thing of the present and most everything can be connected. In fact, with IoT, when something goes wrong, these IoT devices can even take action ‚Äî for example, ordering a new part. We need a way to govern the actions taken by these devices, and smart contracts are a great way to do so.  In an ongoing experiment I have followed in Brooklyn, New York, a community is using a blockchain to record the production of solar energy and enable the purchase of excess renewable energy credits. The device itself has an identity and builds a reputation through its history of records and exchange. Through the blockchain, people can aggregate their purchasing power more easily, share the burden of maintenance, and trust that devices are recording actual solar production.  As IoT continues to evolve and its adoption continues to grow, the ability to autonomously manage devices and actions taken by devices will be essential. Blockchain and smart contracts are positioned well to integrate those capabilities into IoT.",https://github.com/andrewmogbolu2/blockchain-technology,0

Benefits of using Solana Blockchain Solana makes it possible for a centralized database to process 710,000 transactions per second on a standard gigabit network. The transaction fee is less than $0.01 for users and developers Solana becomes the fastest because of its 400 millisecond block times Clock verification makes Solana unique Node synchronization makes the transactions fast. Proof of History helps in integrating timestamp with every transaction approval following to track the transactions which serve as a clock. What technology stack does Solana use?  Proof-of-History A Clock Before Consensus because nodes in a distributed network can‚Äôt trust the timestamp on messages received from other nodes, the biggest problem in distributed networks is agreeing on the time and order in which events happen. Turbine Solana uses a distinct but linked protocol called Turbine to transmit blocks (communicate blocks between validators) independent of consensus. The Turbine is primarily influenced by Bit Torrent and is designed for streaming. Tower BFT A PoH-optimized version of PBFT Solana runs a consensus mechanism dubbed Tower BFT on top of Proof of History, which is a PBFT-like algorithm that uses the synchronized clock allowed by PoH to reach consensus on network transactions. Pipeline A Transaction Processing Unit for validation optimization on the Solana network, the transaction validation procedure takes full use of pipelining, a CPU design improvement. When there is a stream of incoming data that has to be processed in a series of steps with distinct hardware accountable for each step, pipelining is an acceptable technique.

We can easily pay someone without ever hitting the send button, access decentralized applications that cannot be censored or shut down and we can be part of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations.  Mistakes were made, bugs were found, and recently, millions were lost. Some are calling The DAO hack the most expensive bug bounty ever held, but whoever said this certainly didn‚Äôt have his Ether invested in The DAO, as the situation regarding the seizure of the stolen funds doesn‚Äôt seem to be improving.  The DAO happened, it failed, all we can do now is move on and learn from our mistakes. The problem is that if we keep learning from $50m errors, we‚Äôll be the wisest and poorest people on the planet.  That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs good to have training wheels sometimes. Ethereum is the perfect playground for skilled developers, but with its 700% value increase since creation, it has made Solidity, one of the programming languages in Ethereum, a very expensive toy.  That‚Äôs why Krypton has launched an open invitation to all developers to poke around the Krypton blockchain and see what it has to offer.  Krypton (KR) is an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency that allows users all the same features and perks (Smart Contracts, Dapps, DAOs, DACs) but for a lower ‚Äúprice.‚Äù Ethereum transaction fees, which are known as ‚ÄúGas‚Äù are spent according to computational costs, which means that the higher the price of Ether, the higher those costs will be.  covertress, the Krypton founder, and project manager said:  We‚Äôve contacted several faculties at major universities and invited them to use the KR chain for this purpose. All of this means that developers have a testbed for smart contracts and Dapps, which are less expensive to deploy in the KR blockchain, before moving on to a more mainstream environment like Ethereum. Krypton can now be considered as a ‚Äúgateway‚Äù into Ethereum.  The team isn‚Äôt planning to stay humble forever but will, however, take their time before deploying anything and becoming a direct competitor to Ethereum, allowing them to tighten up security and functionality before moving on to providing smart contracts and Dapp solutions for companies.

Krypton can do the same things as Ethereum. However, with Ethereum‚Äôs codebase being updated to safely deploy DAOs, DACs, and DAPPs, there will be an explosion of practical-use cases, especially in the Internet of Things field.

Yes, they are, just disguised in the manner of cyber professionals. In the world of computers and networks, the spells are definitely different. Saving this world from falling into the traps of devils, the wizards of cybersecurity are much beyond your imagination.  With evolving demands and markets, organizations are constantly running towards the threats of cybersecurity. Not just the organization‚Äôs internal information but also their critical values are at risk. There are different techniques used by the attackers to leech the security walls. Ever-more sophisticated cyber-attacks are seen involving malware, phishing, cross-site threats, SQL injections and cryptocurrency. A lot of industries and corporations are suffering from these never-ending attacks.  Need of Cybersecurity Cybersecurity skills play an immense role in such a situation with continuous security requirements for individuals and organizations. Cybersecurity aims to protect all the vulnerable entry points of the data or information, guarding it against attacks. The security aims to protect the crucial information, networks, software and devices from unauthorized access or tools.  Role of Cybersecurity Professional The wizards of this potential skill who can keep digital assets secure are called cybersecurity professionals. The growing world is more dependent on the internet and technology needs. Organizations and entities require more cybersecurity professionals who can secure the data and sensitive information from the attackers as well as counter-attack the threats when imposed.  Rise of Demand There are no enough professionals to meet demand. With such heavy demand rising for cybersecurity professionals, the required number of professionals is still a haze. The rocketing high salaries can show the immediate thirst for the need for the field‚Äôs best skill set. As much as we are joyous about the increasing demand for cybersecurity professionals, knowing the continuity of the demand is important.  Is the demand same all the time? Did you know that the monetary loss that occurred by the cybersecurity breaches is numerous times greater than the amount invested for the security? Yes, any organization would check the odds before investing their time and money. The viable option that companies look for is securing before losing out. And hence, the demand and requirement for cybersecurity professionals and skills will be in the high mark for a sustainable amount of time.  Steps to route the career into Cybersecurity Having almost 1 million vacant jobs to be open by 2023 for cybersecurity professionals worldwide, the best time to act upon is now. Yes, a professional course to know the depths of the subject would help you master the skills required. A world-class program to introduce the sectors of security will be a boon in hand.

65aa8f4fdd4f0ec7d8379140,440577342,What-Lessons-has-COVID-19-Taught-Buyers-and-Suppliers,"The onset of COVID-19 caught many business owners off-guard. Raw material shortages, delivery challenges, and securing supply chain financing were some of the difficulties companies had to face. Ultimately, buyers and suppliers learned that to overcome these hurdles, they need to work collaboratively. By working with the right supply chain finance company, international companies can support collaboration and streamline operations for an entire supply chain, resolving immediate cash flow challenges that could drastically impact a business. This article discusses the lessons buyers and sellers learned from COVID-19, including the benefits of utilizing trade finance, which includes services like non-recourse financing, to improve liquidity during disruption. LESSON 1: KNOW YOUR SUPPLY CHAIN While supply chain disruptions can happen to large or small companies, the most critical factor is how a company handles these circumstances, regardless of the size of their business. By identifying weaknesses in the supply chain, buyers can adapt their business contingency plans accordingly and use methods to monitor and mitigate potential risks. Suppliers should also have contingency plans in place. Many businesses are leveraging real-time analytics to track changes that could alter suppliers‚Äô risk profiles. A company‚Äôs suppliers are an essential asset, and investing in supply chain efficiency enhancements can improve vital decision outcomes. Buyers can begin by mapping out supply chains and identifying crucial subcontractors. Additionally, companies need to know which risk factors are present in their industries. Cyber-threats, natural disasters, warehouse fires, legislative changes, logistics interruptions, and demographic challenges can all come into play. Keeping a supply chain resilient during disruptions requires preparation and established best practices across all suppliers. LESSON 2: EMBRACE TECHNOLOGY AND TRADE FINANCING Buyers and suppliers alike benefit from Third-Party Risk Management software and other technology that enables informed decision-making during business interruptions. By integrating real-time risk management platforms into the operational infrastructure, the supply chain ecosystem becomes more transparent, supporting faster and more appropriate responses during a crisis. Documentation digitization is another technological advancement that facilitates smoother trade transactions amid disruption. In addition, trade finance services, which include non-recourse factoring, can increase trade visibility and mitigate risk through credit monitoring and vetting protocols, which is crucial when supply chains are in need of added security. By ensuring compliance with local regulations, these services can also reduce operational expenses and allow for efficient cross-border shipments. LESSON 3: ADOPT A FLEXIBLE APPROACH Traditional distribution networks fail to emphasize the importance of collaboration and fostering long-term buyer-seller relationships. Businesses that communicate openly with the supply chain members about trade financing possibilities can optimize cash flow and operations. A strategic allocation of working capital enables buyers and sellers to respond to emergencies with greater flexibility. Today‚Äôs global trade market is evolving rapidly, and conditions change frequently. The need to adopt flexible and digital export finance solutions has been present for years. However, it was not until COVID-19 exposed the infrastructure‚Äôs inability to function during a crisis that change became inevitable. In a post-pandemic economy, trade disputes, duties, quotas, and the introduction of new regulatory measures will require the same level of flexibility to keep supply chains robust. LESSON 4: PROMOTE SUPPLY CHAIN TRANSPARENCY Supply chain transparency is another essential component of achieving business resiliency and involves combining fragmented supplier systems into a single collaborative infrastructure. The ability to share data in real-time keeps all parties informed and up-to-date on changes that could otherwise require multiple communication efforts. Visibility into the supply chain can minimize production delays by detecting issues before they have the chance to impact vital elements of production or distribution. For example, when a disruption occurs, suppliers could respond by immediately ordering components from back-up subcontractors. Increasing transparency in the supply chain ensures buyers can make more responsible sourcing decisions. Meanwhile, multitier supply chains can resolve additional concerns regarding sustainability, business continuity, and regulatory compliance. Instead of only examining the first tier of the supply chain, procurement strategies should focus on the supplier network as a whole. FINAL THOUGHTS Connectivity, transparency, technology, and flexibility will empower buyers and suppliers to overcome future disruptions and avoid costly complications. The resiliency-building lessons learned from the pandemic have taught us that establishing collaborative solutions can drive better trade outcomes. With an international trade finance company, buyers and suppliers can align their goals and secure financing to address their cash flow obstacles.

65aab39b2cca313c8c597ddb,398189936,Intelligent-High-Efficiency-Energy-Conversion-System,"Abstract- As yet, the efficiency optimization of the power electronic converters needs to rely on its circuit model, while an inaccurate model cannot represent the correct operation behavior of the converter. Therefore, the accuracy of the power electronic converter model is of great importance for the efficiency optimization. However, the existing modeling methods cannot provide accurately model for the power electronic converters, since the parasitic parameters of its structure are closely related to the components and their layout, and the device structure size. Moreover, due to the power electronic converters usually contain many switching devices and their operating conditions are very complicated in practical application, thus many variable parameters need to be taken into account in the efficiency optimization process, which aggravates the computational complexity of optimization procedure for the efficiency. Based on the analysis mentioned above, the existing methods cannot provide the optimal efficiency optimization modulation strategy for the power electronic converters. Although, the artificial intelligence (AI) is powerful for solving the optimization and decision-making problems of difficult modeling and high-dimensional complex systems, its applications in the power electronic converters efficiency optimization are still being developed.  Inspired by the successful application of the robotic chemist, and the classic games, here, we present an AI aided efficiency optimization engineer for the first time, which can train online to search for improved the operation efficiency for the dual active bridge (DAB) converter without prior knowledge about their circuit model. The engineer operated autonomously around the clock in a practical circuit platform about 71 hours, performing 120, 000 consecutive experiments within a six-variable experimental space, driven by the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. This autonomous exploring approach found an optimized modulation strategy, which can greatly improve the efficiency under entire continuous operation range compares to existing methods, especially under light load conditions. This online optimization approach can be deployed in the conventional power electronic converters for a range of operation performance optimization problems beyond the DAB converter. Our study created a novel idea and expanded the frontier theory for the power electronics automatic optimization.",https://github.com/yhtang123/Intelligent-High-Efficiency-Energy-Conversion-System,0
65aab39b2cca313c8c597ddc,369302661,Implementing_SLAM,"This is a kind of self-learning project that leads to the first step for understanding and analyzing the performance of self-driven robots and cars using Reinforcement learning. Simultaneous Localization And Mapping or SLAM is the most common way that helps the agent predict and learn from its surroundings, to take the steps in its journey towards goal. This is basically implemented using different kinds of sensors and actuators such as LIDAR , gyro and so on, in the state of the art models. Being a fan of AI and its application and a student who takes his first step towards Deep learning and Neural networks, I'm trying to implement it using Python code in way that mimics SLAM. This basically does with two steps : 1. Maps the surroundings or room to create an idea about the area which it is in.   2.  Creating a co-ordinate system with the area and localizing itself within the map, using the information that it got from the surrounding during mapping (Step 1).",https://github.com/haribejishkumar95/Implementing_SLAM,0

Association Football in Europe is the hub for all the businesses related to the game as well as dream destinations of many players across the globe. The movement of a player from one club to another is termed a football transfer and this event has a fee involved between the dealing clubs, most of the time. Since such transfers make or break a club‚Äôs performance for a season or more, they are a subject of immense interest in sports analytics and football betting. Using network science techniques, we analyze the European transfer market from data for 6 seasons spanning the top 5 countries playing football. We learn how this directed network of multiple attributes and dimensions can unravel and confirm some club performances based on network characteristics like betweenness centrality, reciprocity, and transitivity. The data is collected using Python and all social network analysis is performed using R. ",https://github.com/opunsoars/Football-Transfers-Network-Analysis,0

You can alter things up if you begin down a route on the social Web and don't like what you're accomplishing. To get you started, here are few steps It can be difficult to make the first step into social networking. Where do you even begin with? so many individuals, and so much material waiting to be discovered? What are your long-term marketing objectives for your company? It's a lot to take in. To stay on track, it's a good way to start with a strategy that includes goals and an organising structure. You can alter things up if you begin down a route on the social Web and don't like what you're accomplishing. To get you started, here are few steps Be genuine and approachable. Bear that in mind before publishing on the internet. People are hesitant to associate with a company whose social presence appears inflexible and corporate ‚Äì or worse, unappealing. Demonstrate a human side, engage with others in a friendly manner, and grow as a person. That will be well received, and more will follow. Make incredible content. Once you've figured out where your client spends their time and what types of material they want, take the effort to provide more of that material. Please don't give up. To establish a loyal fan base of individuals who respect you as a source who can meet their wants and expectations, you must consistently provide outstanding material, which can also take the shape of dialogues. Construct a content pipeline. You want your social media presence to link to fascinating websites and articles that will add value to people's lives. If you can do that, you'll be able to earn the trust of your customers. As a result, create a content pipeline. What kind of content do you plan to share? When and how will you make them available? Plan ahead and support it for a time, but don't be afraid to change things up if you don't believe it's working. Make a timetable. Set aside time during the day to focus on social media marketing. Spend 5 minutes on Twitter each day before checking your e-mail and then another five minutes each day before leaving work. It's better to connect to a timetable and make absolutely sure you don't miss any of your social media marketing activities when you develop one. Make use of the proper tools. The key to properly managing social media is to make use of technologies that automated or simplify much of the labour. There are numerous solutions available to assist you in increasing your productivity. That implies you don't need a full-fledged social media team to get started using social media for a company. Continue to learn. Listening and learning are two things that can never be stopped. You must be adaptable and understand that change is a positive thing if you want to succeed in social media marketing. Conclusion There's a vast world of social networking sites out there, each with its own set of purposes. Here's how to get the most out of each one: Begin with your most fundamental objectives. Create a lot of content for your social media accounts. Experiment, connect, and keep track of your progress.

65aab8aef36a3071b32a72cd,182211058,What-is-the-Difference-Between-AI-and-Machine-Learning,"Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have empowered our lives to a large extent. The number of advancements made in this space has revolutionized our society and continue making society a better place to live in.  In terms of perception, both Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are often used in the same context which leads to confusion. AI is the concept in which machine makes smart decisions whereas Machine Learning is a sub-field of AI which makes decisions while learning patterns from the input data.  In this blog, we would dissect each term and understand how Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are related to each other.  What is Artificial Intelligence? The term Artificial Intelligence was recognized first in the year 1956 by John Mccarthy in an AI conference.  In layman terms, Artificial Intelligence is about creating intelligent machines which could perform human-like actions. AI is not a modern-day phenomenon. In fact, it has been around since the advent of computers. The only thing that has changed is how we perceive AI and define its applications in the present world.  The exponential growth of AI in the last decade or so has affected every sphere of our lives. Starting from a simple google search which gives the best results of a query to the creation of Siri or Alexa, one of the significant breakthroughs of the 21st century is Artificial Intelligence.  The Four types of Artificial Intelligence are:-  Reactive AI ‚Äì This type of AI lacks historical data to perform actions, and completely reacts to a certain action taken at the moment. It works on the principle of Deep Reinforcement learning where a prize is awarded for any successful action and penalized vice versa. Google‚Äôs AlphaGo defeated experts in Go using this approach. Limited Memory ‚Äì In the case of the limited memory, the past data is kept on adding to the memory. For example, in the case of selecting the best restaurant, the past locations would be taken into account and would be suggested accordingly. Theory of Mind ‚Äì Such type of AI is yet to be built as it involves dealing with human emotions, and psychology. Face and gesture detection comes close but nothing advanced enough to understand human emotions. Self-Aware ‚Äì This is the future advancement of AI which could configure self-representations. The machines could be conscious, and super-intelligent.    Two of the most common usage of AI is in the field of Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing.  Computer Vision is the study of identifying objects such as Face Recognition, Real-time object detection, and so on. Detection of such movements could go a long way in analyzing the sentiments conveyed by a human being.  Natural Language Processing, on the other hand, deals with textual data to extract insights or sentiments from it. From ChatBot Development to Speech Recognition like Amazon‚Äôs Alexa or Apple‚Äôs Siri all uses Natural Language to extract relevant meaning from the data. It is one of the widely popular fields of AI which has found its usefulness in every organization.  One other application of AI which has gained popularity in recent times is the self-driving cars. It uses reinforcement learning technique to learn its best moves and identify the restrictions or blockage in front of the road. Many automobile companies are gradually adopting the concept of self-driving cars.     What is Machine Learning? Machine Learning is a state-of-the-art subset of Artificial Intelligence which let machines learn from past data, and make accurate predictions.  Machine Learning has been around for decades, and the first ML application that got popular was the Email Spam Filter Classification. The system is trained with a set of emails labeled as ‚Äòspam‚Äô and ‚Äònot spam‚Äô known as the training instance. Then a new set of unknown emails is fed to the trained system which then categorizes it as ‚Äòspam‚Äô or ‚Äònot spam.‚Äô  All these predictions are made by a certain group of Regression, and Classification algorithms like ‚Äì Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and so on. The usability of these algorithms varies based on the problem statement and the data set in operation.  Along with these basic algorithms, a sub-field of Machine Learning which has gained immense popularity in recent times is Deep Learning. However, Deep Learning requires enormous computational power and works best with a massive amount of data. It uses neural networks whose architecture is similar to the human brain.  Machine Learning could be subdivided into three categories ‚Äì  Supervised Learning ‚Äì In supervised learning problems, both the input feature and the corresponding target variable is present in the dataset. Unsupervised Learning ‚Äì The dataset is not labeled in an unsupervised learning problem i.e., only the input features are present, but not the target variable. The algorithms need to find out the separate clusters in the dataset based on certain patterns. Reinforcement Learning ‚Äì In this type of problems, the learner is rewarded with a prize for every correct move, and penalized for every incorrect move. The application of Machine Learning is diversified in various domains like Banking, Healthcare, Retail, etc.  One of the use cases in the banking industry is predicting the probability of credit loan default by a borrower given its past transactions, credit history, debt ratio, annual income, and so on. In Healthcare, Machine Learning is often been used to predict patient‚Äôs stay in the hospital, the likelihood of occurrence of a disease, identifying abnormal patterns in the cell, etc.  Many software companies have incorporated Machine Learning in their workflow to steadfast the process of testing. Various manual, repetitive tasks are being replaced by machine learning models.  Comparison Between AI and Machine Learning Machine Learning is the subset of Artificial Intelligence which has taken the advancement in AI to a whole new level. The thought behind letting the computer learn from themselves and voluminous data that are getting generated from various sources in the present world has led to the emergence of Machine Learning.  In Machine Learning, the concept of neural networks plays a significant role in allowing the system to learn from themselves as well as maintaining its speed, and accuracy. The group of neural nets lets a model rectifying its prior decision and make a more accurate prediction next time.  Artificial Intelligence is about acquiring knowledge and applying them to ensure success instead of accuracy. It makes the computer intelligent to make smart decisions on its own akin to the decisions made by a human being. The more complex the problem is, the better it is for AI to solve the complexity.  On the other hand, Machine Learning is mostly about acquiring knowledge and maintaining better accuracy instead of success. The primary aim is to learn from the data to automate specific tasks.  The possibilities around Machine Learning and Neural Networks are endless. A set of sentiments could be understood from raw text. A machine learning application could also listen to music, and even play a piece of appropriate music based on a person‚Äôs mood. NLP, a field of AI which has made some ground-breaking innovations in recent years uses Machine Learning to understand the nuances in natural language and learn to respond accordingly.  Different sectors like banking, healthcare, manufacturing, etc., are reaping the benefits of Artificial Intelligence, particularly Machine Learning. Several tedious tasks are getting automated through ML which saves both time and money.  Machine Learning has been sold these days consistently by marketers even before it has reached its full potential. AI could be seen as something of the old by the marketers who believe Machine Learning is the Holy Grail in the field of analytics.  The future is not far when we would see human-like AI. The rapid advancement in technology has taken us closer than ever before to inevitability. The recent progress in the working AI is much down to how Machine Learning operates.  Both Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning has its own business applications and its usage is completely dependent on the requirements of an organization. AI is an age-old concept with Machine Learning picking up the pace in recent times. Companies like TCS, Infosys are yet to unleash the full potential of Machine Learning and trying to incorporate ML in their applications to keep pace with the rapidly growing Analytics space.  Conclusion The hype around Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are such that various companies and even individuals want to master the skills without even knowing the difference between the two. Often both the terms are misused in the same context.  To master Machine Learning, one needs to have a natural intuition about the data, ask the right questions, and find out the correct algorithms to use to build a model. It often doesn‚Äôt requiem how computational capacity.  On the other hand, AI is about building intelligent systems which require advanced tools and techniques and often used in big companies like Google, Facebook, etc.  There is a whole host of resources to master Machine Learning and AI. The Data Science blogs of Dimensionless is a good place to start with.  Also, There are Online Data Science Courses which cover the various nitty gritty of Machine Learning.",https://github.com/dia2018/What-is-the-Difference-Between-AI-and-Machine-Learning,0
65aab8aef36a3071b32a72ce,310837775,neurons,"An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called ""artificial neurons"", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a ""signal"", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called ""edges"". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.  The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology. Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.  Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.[68]  Decision trees Main article: Decision tree learning Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making.  Support vector machines Main article: Support vector machines Support vector machines (SVMs), also known as support vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category or the other.[69] An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic, binary, linear classifier, although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.   Illustration of linear regression on a data set. Regression analysis Main article: Regression analysis Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is linear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares. The latter is often extended by regularization (mathematics) methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression. When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel[70]), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.  Bayesian networks Main article: Bayesian network  A simple Bayesian network. Rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated, and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet. A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks. Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams.  Genetic algorithms Main article: Genetic algorithm A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s.[71][72] Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.[73]  Training models Usually, machine learning models require a lot of data in order for them to perform well. Usually, when training a machine learning model, one needs to collect a large, representative sample of data from a training set. Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, and data collected from individual users of a service. Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model.  Federated learning Main article: Federated learning Federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server. This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices. For example, Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google.[74]  Applications There are many applications for machine learning, including:  Agriculture Anatomy Adaptive websites Affective computing Banking Bioinformatics Brain‚Äìmachine interfaces Cheminformatics Citizen science Computer networks Computer vision Credit-card fraud detection Data quality DNA sequence classification Economics Financial market analysis[75] General game playing Handwriting recognition Information retrieval Insurance Internet fraud detection Linguistics Machine learning control Machine perception Machine translation Marketing Medical diagnosis Natural language processing Natural language understanding Online advertising Optimization Recommender systems Robot locomotion Search engines Sentiment analysis Sequence mining Software engineering Speech recognition Structural health monitoring Syntactic pattern recognition Telecommunication Theorem proving Time series forecasting User behavior analytics In 2006, the media-services provider Netflix held the first ""Netflix Prize"" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million.[76] Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (""everything is a recommendation"") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly.[77] In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis.[78] In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80% of medical doctors' jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software.[79] In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists.[80] In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning.[81]  Limitations Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results.[82][83][84] Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.[85]  In 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision.[86] Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested.[87][88]  Bias Main article: Algorithmic bias Machine learning approaches in particular can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning system trained on current customers only may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. When trained on man-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the same constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.[89] Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases.[90][91] Machine learning systems used for criminal risk assessment have been found to be biased against black people.[92][93] In 2015, Google photos would often tag black people as gorillas,[94] and in 2018 this still was not well resolved, but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data, and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all.[95] Similar issues with recognizing non-white people have been found in many other systems.[96] In 2016, Microsoft tested a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.[97] Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains.[98] Concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including Fei-Fei Li, who reminds engineers that ""There‚Äôs nothing artificial about AI...It‚Äôs inspired by people, it‚Äôs created by people, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîit impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.‚Äù[99]  Model assessments Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.[100]  In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The total operating characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model's diagnostic ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and ROC's associated area under the curve (AUC).[101]  Ethics Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions. Systems which are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices.[102] For example, using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants against similarity to previous successful applicants.[103][104] Responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning.  Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases.[105][106]  Other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are more seen in health care. There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes. There is huge potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals a great tool to diagnose, medicate, and even plan recovery paths for patients, but this will not happen until the personal biases mentioned previously, and these ""greed"" biases are addressed.[107]  Hardware Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units.[108] By 2019, graphic processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI.[109] OpenAI estimated the hardware compute used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.[110][111]  Software Software suites containing a variety of machine learning algorithms include the following:  Free and open-source so",https://github.com/Aryia-Behroziuan/neurons,0

See ""[Differences between GitHub Apps and OAuth Apps](/apps/differences-between-apps/)"" for more details. - Apps should use the principle of least privilege and should only request the OAuth scopes and GitHub App permissions that the app needs to perform its intended functionality. For more information, see [Principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) in Wikipedia. - Apps should provide customers with a way to delete their account, without having to email or call a support person. - Apps should not share tokens between different implementations of the app. For example, a desktop app should have a separate token from a web-based app. Individual tokens allow each app to request the access needed for GitHub resources separately. - Design your app with different user roles, depending on the functionality needed by each type of user. For example, a standard user should not have access to admin functionality, and billing managers might not need push access to repository code. - Apps should not share service accounts such as email or database services to manage your SaaS service. - All services used in your app should have unique login and password credentials. - Admin privilege access to the production hosting infrastructure should only be given to engineers and employees with administrative duties. - Apps should not use personal access tokens to authenticate and should authenticate as an [OAuth App](/apps/about-apps/#about-oauth-apps) or a [GitHub App](/apps/about-apps/#about-github-apps):   - OAuth Apps should authenticate using an [OAuth token](/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/).   - GitHub Apps should authenticate using either a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-a-github-app), [OAuth token](/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps/), or [installation access token](/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps/#authenticating-as-an-installation).  ### Data protection  - Apps should encrypt data transferred over the public internet using HTTPS, with a valid TLS certificate, or SSH for Git. - Apps should store client ID and client secret keys securely. We recommend storing them as [environmental variables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable#Getting_and_setting_environment_variables). - Apps should delete all GitHub user data within 30 days of receiving a request from the user, or within 30 days of the end of the user's legal relationship with GitHub. - Apps should not require the user to provide their GitHub password. - Apps should encrypt tokens, client IDs, and client secrets.  ### Logging and monitoring  Apps should have logging and monitoring capabilities. App logs should be retained for at least 30 days and archived for at least one year. A security log should include:  - Authentication and authorization events - Service configuration changes - Object reads and writes - All user and group permission changes - Elevation of role to admin - Consistent timestamping for each event - Source users, IP addresses, and/or hostnames for all logged actions  ### Incident response workflow  To provide a secure experience for users, you should have a clear incident response plan in place before listing your app. We recommend having a security and operations incident response team in your company rather than using a third-party vendor. You should have the capability to notify {% data variables.product.product_name %} within 24 hours of a confirmed incident.  For an example of an incident response workflow, see the ""Data Breach Response Policy"" on the [SANS Institute website](https://www.sans.org/information-security-policy/). A short document with clear steps to take in the event of an incident is more valuable than a lengthy policy template.  ### Vulnerability management and patching workflow  You should conduct regular vulnerability scans of production infrastructure. You should triage the results of vulnerability scans and define a period of time in which you agree to remediate the vulnerability.  If you are not ready to set up a full vulnerability management program, it's useful to start by creating a patching process.

Discussions are for conversations that need to be transparent and accessible but do not need to be tracked on a project board and are not related to code, unlike issues. Discussions enable fluid, open conversation in a public forum.  Discussions give a space for more collaborative conversations by connecting and giving a more centralized area to connect and find information.  ### Enabling {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} on your repository  Repository owners and people with write access can enable {% data variables.product.prodname_discussions %} for a community on their public repositories.

Pinning and locking discussions helps people know that a post is meant as an announcement. You can use announcements as a way to link people to more resources and offer guidance for opening discussions in your community. For more information about pinning a discussion, see ""[Managing discussions in your repository](/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions-in-your-repository#pinning-a-discussion).""   ### Setting up community guidelines for contributors  You can set contributing guidelines to encourage collaborators to have meaningful, useful conversations that are relevant to the repository. You can also update the repository's README to communicate expectations on when collaborators should open an issue or discussion.  For more information about providing guidelines for your project, see ""[Adding a code of conduct to your project](/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project)"" and ""[Setting up your project for healthy contributions](/github/building-a-strong-community/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions).""  ### Creating a new discussion  Anyone with access to a repository can create a discussion.  {% data reusables.discussions.starting-a-discussion %}  ### Organizing discussions into relevant categories  Repository owners and people with write access can create new categories to keep discussions organized.

65aab9fe1faca6df53415c0c,218151890,-L-,"W3C Strategic Highlights  September 2019  This report was prepared for the September 2019 W3C Advisory Committee Meeting (W3C Member link). See the accompanying W3C Fact Sheet ‚Äî September 2019. For the previous edition, see the April 2019 W3C Strategic Highlights. For future editions of this report, please consult the latest version.  A Chinese translation is available.  ‚ò∞ Contents  Introduction Future Web Standards Meeting Industry Needs Web Payments Digital Publishing Media and Entertainment Web & Telecommunications Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) Web & Networks Automotive Web of Things Strengthening the Core of the Web HTML CSS Fonts SVG Audio Performance Web Performance WebAssembly Testing Browser Testing and Tools WebPlatform Tests Web of Data Web for All Security, Privacy, Identity Internationalization (i18n) Web Accessibility Outreach to the world W3C Developer Relations W3C Training Translations W3C Liaisons Introduction  This report highlights recent work of enhancement of the existing landscape of the Web platform and innovation for the growth and strength of the Web.  33 working groups and a dozen interest groups enable W3C to pursue its mission through the creation of Web standards, guidelines, and supporting materials. We track the tremendous work done across the Consortium through homogeneous work-spaces in Github which enables better monitoring and management.  We are in the middle of a period where we are chartering numerous working groups which demonstrate the rapid degree of change for the Web platform:  After 4 years, we are nearly ready to publish a Payment Request API Proposed Recommendation and we need to soon charter follow-on work. In the last year we chartered the Web Payment Security Interest Group. In the last year we chartered the Web Media Working Group with 7 specifications for next generation Media support on the Web. We have Accessibility Guidelines under W3C Member review which includes Silver, a new approach. We have just launched the Decentralized Identifier Working Group which has tremendous potential because Decentralized Identifier (DID) is an identifier that is globally unique, resolveable with high availability, and cryptographically verifiable. We have Privacy IG (PING) under W3C Member review which strengthens our focus on the tradeoff between privacy and function. We have a new CSS charter under W3C Member review which maps the group's work for the next three years. In this period, W3C and the WHATWG have succesfully completed the negotiation of a Memorandum of Understanding rooted in the mutual belief that that having two distinct specifications claiming to be normative is generally harmful for the Web community. The MOU, signed last May, describes how the two organizations are to collaborate on the development of a single authoritative version of the HTML and DOM specifications. W3C subsequently rechartered the HTML Working Group to assist the W3C community in raising issues and proposing solutions for the HTML and DOM specifications, and for the production of W3C Recommendations from WHATWG Review Drafts.  As the Web evolves continuously, some groups are looking for ways for specifications to do so as well. So-called ""evergreen recommendations"" or ""living standards"" aim to track continuous development (and maintenance) of features, on a feature-by-feature basis, while getting review and patent commitments.  We see the maturation and further development of an incredible number of new technologies coming to the Web. Continued progress in many areas demonstrates the vitality of the W3C and the Web community, as the rest of the report illustrates.  Future Web Standards W3C has a variety of mechanisms for listening to what the community thinks could become good future Web standards. These include discussions with the Membership, discussions with other standards bodies, the activities of thousands of participants in over 300 community groups, and W3C Workshops. There are lots of good ideas. The W3C strategy team has been identifying promising topics and invites public participation.   Future, recent and under consideration Workshops include:  Inclusive XR (5-6 November 2019, Seattle, WA, USA) to explore existing and future approaches on making Virtual and Augmented Reality experiences more inclusive, including to people with disabilities; W3C Workshop on Data Models for Transportation (12-13 September 2019, Palo Alto, CA, USA) W3C Workshop on Web Games (27-28 June 2019, Redmond, WA, USA), view report Second W3C Workshop on the Web of Things (3-5 June 2019, Munich, Germany) W3C Workshop on Web Standardization for Graph Data; Creating Bridges: RDF, Property Graph and SQL (4-6 March 2019, Berlin, Germany), view report Web & Machine Learning. The Strategy Funnel documents the staff's exploration of potential new work at various phases: Exploration and Investigation, Incubation and Evaluation, and eventually to the chartering of a new standards group. The Funnel view is a GitHub Project where new area are issues represented by ‚Äúcards‚Äù which move through the columns, usually from left to right. Most cards start in Exploration and move towards Chartering, or move out of the funnel.  Public input is welcome at any stage but particularly once Incubation has begun. This helps W3C identify work that is sufficiently incubated to warrant standardization, to review the ecosystem around the work and indicate interest in participating in its standardization, and then to draft a charter that reflects an appropriate scope. Ongoing feedback can speed up the overall standardization process.  Since the previous highlights document, W3C has chartered a number of groups, and started discussion on many more:  Newly Chartered or Rechartered  Web Application Security WG (03-Apr) Web Payment Security IG (17-Apr) Patent and Standards IG (24-Apr) Web Applications WG (14-May) Web & Networks IG (16-May) Media WG (23-May) Media and Entertainment IG (06-Jun) HTML WG (06-Jun) Decentralized Identifier WG (05-Sep) Extended  Privacy IG (PING) (30-Sep) Verifiable Claims WG (30-Sep) Service Workers WG (31-Dec) Dataset Exchange WG (31-Dec) Web of Things Working Group (31-Dec) Web Audio Working Group (31-Dec) Proposed charters / Advance Notice  Accessibility Guidelines WG Privacy IG (PING) RDF Literal Direction WG Timed Text WG CSS WG Web Authentication WG Closed  Internationalization Tag Set IG Meeting Industry Needs Web Payments   All Web Payments specifications  W3C's payments standards enable a streamlined checkout experience, enabling a consistent user experience across the Web with lower front end development costs for merchants. Users can store and reuse information and more quickly and accurately complete online transactions.  The Web Payments Working Group has republished Payment Request API as a Candidate Recommendation, aiming to publish a Proposed Recommendation in the Fall 2019, and is discussing use cases and features for Payment Request after publication of the 1.0 Recommendation. Browser vendors have been finalizing implementation of features added in the past year (view the implementation report).  As work continues on the Payment Handler API and its implementation (currently in Chrome and Edge Canary), one focus in 2019 is to increase adoption in other browsers. Recently, Mastercard demonstrated the use of Payment Request API to carry out EMVCo's Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) protocol whose payment method definition is being developed with active participation by Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover. Payment method availability is a key factor in merchant considerations about adopting Payment Request API. The ability to get uniform adoption of a new payment method such as Secure Remote Commerce (SRC) also depends on the availability of the Payment Handler API in browsers, or of proprietary alternatives.  Web Monetization, which the Web Payments Working Group will discuss again at its face-to-face meeting in September, can be used to enable micropayments as an alternative revenue stream to advertising.  Since the beginning of 2019, Amazon, Brave Software, JCB, Certus Cybersecurity Solutions and Netflix have joined the Web Payments Working Group.  In April, W3C launched the Web Payment Security Group to enable W3C, EMVCo, and the FIDO Alliance to collaborate on a vision for Web payment security and interoperability. Participants will define areas of collaboration and identify gaps between existing technical specifications in order to increase compatibility among different technologies, such as:  How do SRC, FIDO, and Payment Request relate? The Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) regulations in Europe are scheduled to take effect in September 2019. What is the role of EMVCo, W3C, and FIDO technologies, and what is the current state of readiness for the deadline? How can we improve privacy on the Web at the same time as we meet industry requirements regarding user identity? Digital Publishing   All Digital Publishing specifications, Publication milestones  The Web is the universal publishing platform. Publishing is increasingly impacted by the Web, and the Web increasingly impacts Publishing.  Topic of particular interest to Publishing@W3C include typography and layout, accessibility, usability, portability, distribution, archiving, offline access, print on demand, and reliable cross referencing. And the diverse publishing community represented in the groups consist of the traditional ""trade"" publishers, ebook reading system manufacturers, but also publishers of audio book, scholarly journals or educational materials, library scientists or browser developers.  The Publishing Working Group currently concentrates on Audiobooks which lack a comprehensive standard, thus incurring extra costs and time to publish in this booming market. Active development is ongoing on the future standard:  Publication Manifest Audiobook profile for Web Publications Lightweight Packaging Format The BD Comics Manga Community Group, the Synchronized Multimedia for Publications Community Group, the Publishing Community Group and a future group on archival, are companions to the working group where specific work is developed and incubated.  The Publishing Community Group is a recently launched incubation channel for Publishing@W3C. The goal of the group is to propose, document, and prototype features broadly related to:  publications on the Web reading modes and systems and the user experience of publications The EPUB 3 Community Group has successfully completed the revision of EPUB 3.2.  The Publishing Business Group fosters ongoing participation by members of the publishing industry and the overall ecosystem in the development of Web infrastructure to better support the needs of the industry. The Business Group serves as an additional conduit to the Publishing Working Group and several Community Groups for feedback between the publishing ecosystem and W3C. The Publishing BG has played a vital role in fostering and advancing the adoption and continued development of EPUB 3. In particular the BG provided critical support to the update of EPUBCheck to validate EPUB content to the new EPUB 3.2 specification. This resulted in the development, in conjunction with the EPUB3 Community Group, of a new generation of EPUBCheck, i.e., EPUBCheck 4.2 production-ready release.  Media and Entertainment   All Media specifications  The Media and Entertainment vertical tracks media-related topics and features that create immersive experiences for end users. HTML5 brought standard audio and video elements to the Web. Standardization activities since then have aimed at turning the Web into a professional platform fully suitable for the delivery of media content and associated materials, enabling missing features to stream video content on the Web such as adaptive streaming and content protection. Together with Microsoft, Comcast, Netflix and Google, W3C received an Technology & Engineering Emmy Award in April 2019 for standardization of a full TV experience on the Web. Current goals are to:  Reinforce core media technologies: Creation of the Media Working Group, to develop media-related specifications incubated in the WICG (e.g. Media Capabilities, Picture-in-picture, Media Session) and maintain maintain/evolve Media Source Extensions (MSE) and Encrypted Media Extensions (EME). Improve support for Media Timed Events: data cues incubation. Enhance color support (HDR, wide gamut), in scope of the CSS WG and in the Color on the Web CG. Reduce fragmentation: Continue annual releases of a common and testable baseline media devices, in scope of the Web Media APIs CG and in collaboration with the CTA WAVE Project. Maintain the Road-map of Media Technologies for the Web which highlights Web technologies that can be used to build media applications and services, as well as known gaps to enable additional use cases. Create the future: Discuss perspectives for Media and Entertainment for the Web. Bring the power of GPUs to the Web (graphics, machine learning, heavy processing), under incubation in the GPU for the Web CG. Transition to a Working Group is under discussion. Determine next steps after the successful W3C Workshop on Web Games of June 2019. View the report. Timed Text  The Timed Text Working Group develops and maintains formats used for the representation of text synchronized with other timed media, like audio and video, and notably works on TTML, profiles of TTML, and WebVTT. Recent progress includes:  A robust WebVTT implementation report poises the specification for publication as a proposed recommendation. Discussions around re-chartering, notably to add a TTML Profile for Audio Description deliverable to the scope of the group, and clarify that rendering of captions within XR content is also in scope. Immersive Web  Hardware that enables Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) applications are now broadly available to consumers, offering an immersive computing platform with both new opportunities and challenges. The ability to interact directly with immersive hardware is critical to ensuring that the web is well equipped to operate as a first-class citizen in this environment.  The Immersive Web Working Group has been stabilizing the WebXR Device API while the companion Immersive Web Community Group incubates the next series of features identified as key for the future of the Immersive Web.  W3C plans a workshop focused on the needs and benefits at the intersection of VR & Accessibility (Inclusive XR), on 5-6 November 2019 in Seattle, WA, USA, to explore existing and future approaches on making Virtual and Augmented Reality experiences more inclusive.  Web & Telecommunications  The Web is the Open Platform for Mobile. Telecommunication service providers and network equipment providers have long been critical actors in the deployment of Web technologies. As the Web platform matures, it brings richer and richer capabilities to extend existing services to new users and devices, and propose new and innovative services.  Real-Time Communications (WebRTC)   All Real-Time Communications specifications  WebRTC has reshaped the whole communication landscape by making any connected device a potential communication end-point, bringing audio and video communications anywhere, on any network, vastly expanding the ability of operators to reach their customers. WebRTC serves as the corner-stone of many online communication and collaboration services.  The WebRTC Working Group aims to bringing WebRTC 1.0 (and companion specification Media Capture and Streams) to Recommendation by the end of 2019. Intense efforts are focused on testing (supported by a dedicated hackathon at IETF 104) and interoperability. The group is considering pushing features that have not gotten enough traction to separate modules or to a later minor revision of the spec.  Beyond WebRTC 1.0, the WebRTC Working Group will focus its efforts on WebRTC NV which the group has started documenting by identifying use cases.  Web & Networks  Recently launched, in the wake of the May 2018 Web5G workshop, the Web & Networks Interest Group is chaired by representatives from AT&T, China Mobile and Intel, with a goal to explore solutions for web applications to achieve better performance and resource allocation, both on the device and network. The group's first efforts are around use cases, privacy & security requirements and liaisons.  Automotive   All Automotive specifications  To create a rich application ecosystem for vehicles and other devices allowed to connect to the vehicle, the W3C Automotive Working Group is delivering a service specification to expose all common vehicle signals (engine temperature, fuel/charge level, range, tire pressure, speed, etc.)  The Vehicle Information Service Specification (VISS), which is a Candidate Recommendation, is seeing more implementations across the industry. It provides the access method to a common data model for all the vehicle signals ‚Äìpresently encapsulating a thousand or so different data elements‚Äì and will be growing to accommodate the advances in automotive such as autonomous and driver assist technologies and electrification.  The group is already working on a successor to VISS, leveraging the underlying data model and the VIWI submission from Volkswagen, for a more robust means of accessing vehicle signals information and the same paradigm for other automotive needs including location-based services, media, notifications and caching content.  The Automotive and Web Platform Business Group acts as an incubator for prospective standards work. One of its task forces is using W3C VISS in performing data sampling and off-boarding the information to the cloud. Access to the wealth of information that W3C's auto signals standard exposes is of interest to regulators, urban planners, insurance companies, auto manufacturers, fleet managers and owners, service providers and others. In addition to components needed for data sampling and edge computing, capturing user and owner consent, information collection methods and handling of data are in scope.  The upcoming W3C Workshop on Data Models for Transportation (September 2019) is expected to focus on the need of additional ontologies around transportation space.  Web of Things   All Web of Things specifications  W3C's Web of Things work is designed to bridge disparate technology stacks to allow devices to work together and achieve scale, thus enabling the potential of the Internet of Things by eliminating fragmentation and fostering interoperability.  Thing descriptions expressed in JSON-LD cover the behavior, interaction affordances, data schema, security configuration, and protocol bindings. The Web of Things complements existing IoT ecosystems to reduce the cost and risk for suppliers and consumers of applications that create value by combining multiple devices and information services. There are many sectors that will benefit, e.g. smart homes, smart cities, smart industry, smart agriculture, smart healthcare and many more.  The Web of Things Working Group is finishing the initial Web of Things standards, with support from the Web of Things Interest Group:  Web of Things Architecture Thing Descriptions Strengthening the Core of the Web HTML   The HTML Working Group was chartered early June to assist the W3C community in raising issues and proposing solutions for the HTML and DOM specifications, and to produce W3C Recommendations from WHATWG Review Drafts.  A few days before, W3C and the WHATWG signed a Memorandum of Understanding outlining the agreement to collaborate on the development of a single version of the HTML and DOM specifications.  Issues and proposed solutions for HTML and DOM done via the newly rechartered HTML Working Group in the WHATWG repositories  The HTML Working Group is targetting November 2019 to bring HTML and DOM to Candidate Recommendations.  CSS  All CSS specifications  CSS is a critical part of the Open Web Platform. The CSS Working Group gathers requirements from two large groups of CSS users: the publishing industry and application developers. Within W3C, those groups are exemplified by the Publishing groups and the Web Platform Working Group. The former requires things like better pagination support and advanced font handling, the latter needs intelligent (and fast!) scrolling and animations.  What we know as CSS is actually a collection of almost a hundred specifications, referred to as ‚Äòmodules‚Äô. The current state of CSS is defined by a snapshot, updated once a year. The group also publishes an index defining every term defined by CSS specifications.  Fonts   All Fonts specifications  The Web Fonts Working Group develops specifications that allow the interoperable deployment of downloadable fonts on the Web, with a focus on Progressive Font Enrichment as well as maintenance of WOFF Recommendations.  Recent and ongoing work includes:  Early API experiments by Adobe and Monotype have demonstrated the feasibility of a font enrichment API, where a server delivers a font with minimal glyph repertoire and the client can query the full repertoire and request additional subsets on-the-fly. In other experiments, the Brotli compression used in WOFF 2 was extended to support shared dictionaries and patch update. Metrics to quantify improvement are a current hot discussion topic. The group will meet at ATypi 2019 in Japan, to gather requirements from the international typography community. The group will first produce a report summarizing the strengths and weaknesses of each prototype solution by Q2 2020. SVG   All SVG specifications  SVG is an important and widely-used part of the Open Web Platform. The SVG Working Group focuses on aligning the SVG 2.0 specification with browser implementations, having split the specification into a currently-implemented 2.0 and a forward-looking 2.1. Current activity is on stabilization, increased integration with the Open Web Platform, and test coverage analysis.  The Working Group was rechartered in March 2019. A new work item concerns native (non-Web-browser) uses of SVG as a non-interactive, vector graphics format.  Audio  The Web Audio Working Group was extended to finish its work on the Web Audio API, expecting to publish it as a Recommendation by year end. The specification enables synthesizing audio in the browser. Audio operations are performed with audio nodes, which are linked together to form a modular audio routing graph. Multiple sources ‚Äî with different types of channel layout ‚Äî are supported. This modular design provides the flexibility to create complex audio functions with dynamic effects.  The first version of Web Audio API is now feature complete and is implemented in all modern browsers. Work has started on the next version, and new features are being incubated in the Audio Community Group.  Performance   Web Performance  All Web Performance specifications  There are currently 18 specifications in development in the Web Performance Working Group aiming to provide methods to observe and improve aspects of application performance of user agent features and APIs. The W3C team is looking at related work incubated in the W3C GPU for the Web (WebGPU) Community Group which is poised to transition to a W3C Working Group. A preliminary draft charter is available.  WebAssembly  All WebAssembly specifications  WebAssembly improves Web performance and power by being a virtual machine and execution environment enabling loaded pages to run native (compiled) code. It is deployed in Firefox, Edge, Safari and Chrome. The specification will soon reach Candidate Recommendation.  WebAssembly enables near-native performance, optimized load time, and perhaps most importantly, a compilation target for existing code bases. While it has a small number of native types, much of the performance increase relative to Javascript derives from its use of consistent typing. WebAssembly leverages decades of optimization for compiled languages and the byte code is optimized for compactness and streaming (the web page starts executing while the rest of the code downloads). Network and API access all occurs through accompanying Javascript libraries -- the security model is identical to that of Javascript.  Requirements gathering and language development occur in the Community Group while the Working Group manages test development, community review and progression of specifications on the Recommendation Track.  Testing  Browser testing plays a critical role in the growth of the Web by:  Improving the reliability of Web technology definitions; Improving the quality of implementations of these technologies by helping vendors to detect bugs in their products; Improving the data available to Web developers on known bugs and deficiencies of Web technologies by publishing results of these tests. Browser Testing and Tools  The Browser Testing and Tools Working Group is developing WebDriver version 2, having published last year the W3C Recommendation of WebDriver. WebDriver acts as a remote control interface that enables introspection and control of user agents, provides a platform- and language-neutral wire protocol as a way for out-of-process programs to remotely instruct the behavior of Web, and emulates the actions of a real person using the browser.  WebPlatform Tests   The WebPlatform Tests project now provides a mechanism which allows to fully automate tests that previously needed to be run manually: TestDriver.  TestDriver enables sending trusted key and mouse events, sending complex series of trusted pointer and key interactions for things like in-content drag-and-drop or pinch zoom, and even file upload.  Since 2014 W3C began work on this coordinated open-source effort to build a cross-browser test suite for the Web Platform, which WHATWG, and all major browsers adopted.  Web of Data   All Data specifications  There have been several great success stories around the standardization of data on the web over the past year.  Verifiable Claims seems to have significant uptake. It is also significant that the Distributed Identifier WG charter has received numerous favorable reviews, and was just recently launched. JSON-LD has been a major success with the large deployment on Web sites via schema.org.  JSON-LD 1.1 completed technical work, about to transition to CR More than 25% of websites today include schema.org data in JSON-LD The Web of Things description is in CR since May, making use of JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials data model is in CR since July, also making use of JSON-LD Continued strong interest in decentralized identifiers Engagement from the TAG with reframing core documents, such as Ethical Web Principles, to include data on the web within their scope Data is increasingly important for all organizations, especially with the rise of IoT and Big Data. W3C has a mature and extensive suite of standards relating to data that were developed over two decades of experience, with plans for further work on making it easier for developers to work with graph data and knowledge graphs.  Linked Data is about the use of URIs as names for things, the ability to dereference these URIs to get further information and to include links to other data. There are ever-increasing sources of open Linked Data on the Web, as well as data services that are restricted to the suppliers and consumers of those services.  The digital transformation of industry is seeking to exploit advanced digital technologies. This will facilitate businesses to integrate horizontally along the supply and value chains, and vertically from the factory floor to the office floor. W3C is seeking to make it easier to support enterprise-wide data management and governance, reflecting the strategic importance of data to modern businesses.  Traditional approaches to data have focused on tabular databases (SQL/RDBMS), Comma Separated Value (CSV) files, and data embedded in PDF documents and spreadsheets. We're now in midst of a major shift to graph data with nodes and labeled directed links between them. Graph data is:  Faster than using SQL and associated JOIN operations More favorable to integrating data from heterogeneous sources Better suited to situations where the data model is evolving In the wake of the recent W3C Workshop on Graph Data we are in the process of launching a Graph Standardization Business Group to provide a business perspective with use cases and requirements, to coordinate technical standards work and liaisons with external organizations.  Web for All Security, Privacy, Identity  All Security specifications, all Privacy specifications  Authentication on the Web   As the WebAuthn Level 1 W3C Recommendation published last March is seeing wide implementation and adoption of strong cryptographic authentication, work is proceeding on Level 2.  The open standard Web API gives native authentication technology built into native platforms, browsers, operating systems (including mobile) and hardware, offering protection against hacking, credential theft, phishing attacks, thus aiming to end the era of passwords as a security construct. You may read more in our March press release.  Privacy  An increasing number of W3C specifications are benefitting from Privacy and Security review; there are security and privacy aspects to every specification. Early review is essential. Working with the TAG, the Privacy Interest Group has updated the Self-Review Questionnaire: Security and Privacy.  Other recent work of the group includes public blogging further to the exploration of anti-patterns in standards and permission prompts.  Security  The Web Application Security Working Group adopted Feature Policy, aiming to allow developers to selectively enable, disable, or modify the behavior of some of these browser features and APIs within their application; and Fetch Metadata, aiming to provide servers with enough information to make a priori decisions about whether or not to service a request based on the way it was made, and the context in which it will be used.  The Web Payment Security Interest Group, launched last April, convenes members from W3C, EMVCo, and the FIDO Alliance to discuss cooperative work to enhance the security and interoperability of Web payments (read more about payments).  Internationalization (i18n)   All Internationalization specifications, educational articles related to Internationalization, spec developers checklist  Only a quarter or so current Web users use English online and that proportion will continue to decrease as the Web reaches more and more communities of limited English proficiency. If the Web is to live up to the ""World Wide"" portion of its name, and for the Web to truly work for stakeholders all around the world engaging with content in various languages, it must support the needs of worldwide users as they engage with content in the various languages. The growth of epublishing also brings requirements for new features and improved typography on the Web. It is important to ensure the needs of local communities are captured.  The W3C Internationalization Initiative was set up to increase in-house resources dedicated to accelerating progress in making the World Wide Web ""worldwide"" by gathering user requirements, supporting developers, and education & outreach.  For an overview of current projects see the i18n radar. W3C's Internationalization efforts progressed on a number of fronts recently:  Requirements: New African and European language groups will work on the gap analysis, errata and layout requirements. Gap analysis: Japanese, Devanagari, Bengali, Tamil, Lao, Khmer, Javanese, and Ethiopic updated in the gap-analysis documents. Layout requirements document: notable progress tracked in the Southeast Asian Task Force while work continues on Chinese layout requirements. Developer support: Spec reviews: the i18n WG continues active review of specifications of the WHATWG and other W3C Working Groups. Short review checklist: easy way to begin a self-review to help spec developers understand what aspects of their spec are likely to need attention for internationalization, and points them to more detailed checklists for the relevant topics. It also helps those reviewing specs for i18n issues. Strings on the Web: Language and Direction Metadata lays out issues and discusses potential solutions for passing information about language and direction with strings in JSON or other data formats. The document was rewritten for clarity, and expanded. The group is collaborating with the JSON-LD and Web Publishing groups to develop a plan for updating RDF, JSON-LD and related specifications to handle metadata for base direction of text (bidi). User-friendly test format: a new format was developed for Internationalization Test Suite tests, which displays helpful information about how the test works. This particularly useful because those tests are pointed to by educational materials and gap-analysis documents. Web Platform Tests: a large number of tests in the i18n test suite have been ported to the WPT repository, including: css-counter-styles, css-ruby, css-syntax, css-test, css-text-decor, css-writing-modes, and css-pseudo. Education & outreach: (for all educational materials, see the HTML & CSS Authoring Techniques) Web Accessibility   All Accessibility specifications, WAI resources  The Web Accessibility Initiative supports W3C's Web for All mission. Recent achievements include:  Education and training: Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA updated to bring our analysis and recommendations up to date with CAPTCHA practice today, concluding two years of extensive work and invaluable input from the public (read more on the W3C Blog Learn why your web content and applications should be accessible. The Education and Outreach Working Group has completed revision and updating of the Business Case for Digital Accessibility. Accessibility guidelines: The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group has continued to update WCAG Techniques and Understanding WCAG 2.1; and published a Candidate Recommendation of Accessibility Conformance Testing Rules Format 1.0 to improve inter-rater reliability when evaluating conformance of web content to WCAG An updated charter is being developed to host work on ""Silver"", the next generation accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.2) There are accessibility aspects to most specifications. Check your work with the FAST checklist.  Outreach to the world W3C Developer Relations   To foster the excellent feedback loop between Web Standards development and Web developers, and to grow participation from that diverse community, recent W3C Developer Relations activities include:  @w3cdevs tracks the enormous amount of work happening across W3C W3C Track during the Web Conference 2019 in San Francisco Tech videos: W3C published the 2019 Web Games Workshop videos The 16 September 2019 Developer Meetup in Fukuoka, Japan, is open to all and will combine a set of technical demos prepared by W3C groups, and a series of talks on a selected set of W3C technologies and projects W3C is involved with Mozilla, Google, Samsung, Microsoft and Bocoup in the organization of ViewSource 2019 in Amsterdam (read more on the W3C Blog) W3C Training   In partnership with EdX, W3C's MOOC training program, W3Cx offers a complete ""Front-End Web Developer"" (FEWD) professional certificate program that consists of a suite of five courses on the foundational languages that power the Web: HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. We count nearly 900K students from all over the world.  Translations  Many Web users rely on translations of documents developed at W3C whose official language is English. W3C is extremely grateful to the continuous efforts of its community in ensuring our various deliverables in general, and in our specifications in particular, are made available in other languages, for free, ensuring their exposure to a much more diverse set of readers.  Last Spring we developed a more robust system, a new listing of translations of W3C specifications and updated the instructions on how to contribute to our translation efforts.  W3C Liaisons   Liaisons and coordination with numerous organizations and Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) is crucial for W3C to:  make sure standards are interoperable coordinate our respective agenda in Internet governance: W3C participates in ICANN, GIPO, IGF, the I* organizations (ICANN, IETF, ISOC, IAB). ensure at the government liaison level that our standards work is officially recognized when important to our membership so that products based on them (often done by our members) are part of procurement orders. W3C has ARO/PAS status with ISO. W3C participates in the EU MSP and Rolling Plan on Standardization ensure the global set of Web and Internet standards form a compatible stack of technologies, at the technical and policy level (patent regime, fragmentation, use in policy making) promote Standards adoption equally by the industry, the public sector, and the public at large Coralie Mercier, Editor, W3C Marketing & Communications $Id: Overview.html,v 1.60 2019/10/15 12:05:52 coralie Exp $ Copyright ¬© 2019 W3C ¬Æ (MIT, ERCIM, Keio, Beihang) Usage policies apply.",https://github.com/jettbrains/-L-,0

65aab9ff1faca6df53415c12,47894989,Red-C-SDK,"MEGA SDK - Client Access Engine Coverity Scan Build Status MEGA --- The Privacy Company --- is a Secure Cloud Storage provider that protects your data thanks to end-to-end encryption. We call it User Controlled Encryption, or UCE, and all our clients automatically manage it.  All files stored on MEGA are encrypted. All data transfers from and to MEGA are encrypted. And while most cloud storage providers can and do claim the same, MEGA is different ‚Äì unlike the industry norm where the cloud storage provider holds the decryption key, with MEGA, you control the encryption, you hold the keys, and you decide who you grant or deny access to your files.  This SDK brings you all the power of our client applications and let you create your own or analyze the security of our products. Are you ready to start? Please continue reading.  SDK Contents  In this SDK, you can find our low level SDK, that was already released few months after the MEGA launch, a new intermediate layer to make it easier to use and to bind with other programming languages, and example apps for all our currently supported platforms (Windows, Linux, OSX, Android, iOS and Windows Phone).  In the examples folder you can find example apps using:  The low level SDK:  megacli (a powerful command line tool that allows to use all SDK features) megasimplesync (a command line tool that allows to use the synchronization engine) The intermediate layer:  An example app for Visual Studio in examples/win32 An example app for Android (using Java bindings based on SWIG) in examples/android An example app for iOS (using Objective-C bindings) in examples/iOS An example app for Windows Phone (using Windows Phone bindings) in examples/wp8 Building  If you plan to develop an app using this SDK, please use the stable branch or the last released tarball. The master branch is continuously evolving, could be unstable and could change very often.  For platforms with Autotools, the generic way to build and install it is:  sh autogen.sh ./configure make sudo make install That compilation will include the examples using our low level SDK (megacli and megasimplesync) You also have specific build instructions for OSX (doc/OSX.txt) and FreeBSD (doc/FreeBSD.txt) and a build script to automatically download and build the SDK along with all its dependencies (contrib/build_sdk.sh)  For other platforms, or if you want to see how to use the new intermediate layer, the easiest way is to get a smooth start is to build one of the examples in subfolders of the examples folder.  All these folders contains a README.md file with information about how to get the project up and running, including the installation of all required dependencies.  Usage  The low level SDK doesn't have inline documentation yet. If you want to use it, please check one of our example apps (examples/megacli, examples/megasimplesync).  The new intermediate layer has been documented using Doxygen. The only public header that you need to include to use is include/megaapi.h. You can read the documentation in that header file, or download the same documentation in HTML format from this link:  https://mega.co.nz/#!c5FzhBJL!HUVjsOJTylwkmXPZ0AxT66Wuu4YvZInyHbWGYgvTHt4  Additional info  Platform Dependencies  Dependencies are different for each platform because the SDK uses generic interfaces to get some features and they have different implentations:  Network (cURL with OpenSSL/c-ares or WinHTTP) Filesystem access (Posix or Win32) Graphics management (FreeImage, QT or iOS frameworks) Database (SQLite or Berkeley DB) Threads/mutexes (Win32, pthread, QT threads, or C++11) POSIX (Linux/Darwin/BSD/OSX ...)  Install the following development packages, if available, or download and compile their respective sources (package names are for Debian and RedHat derivatives, respectively):  cURL (libcurl4-openssl-dev, libcurl-devel), compiled with --enable-ssl c-ares (libc-ares-dev, libcares-devel, c-ares-devel) OpenSSL (libssl-dev, openssl-devel) Crypto++ (libcrypto++-dev, libcryptopp-devel) zlib (zlib1g-dev, zlib-devel) SQLite (libsqlite3-dev, sqlite-devel) or configure --without-sqlite FreeImage (libfreeimage-dev, freeimage-devel) or configure --without-freeimage pthread Optional dependency:  Sodium (libsodium-dev, libsodium-devel), configure --with-sodium Filesystem event monitoring: The provided filesystem layer implements the Linux inotify and the MacOS fsevents interfaces.  To build the reference megacli example, you may also need to install:  GNU Readline (libreadline-dev, readline-devel) For Android, we provide an additional implementation of the graphics subsystem using Android libraries.  For iOS, we provide an additional implementation of the graphics subsystem using Objective C frameworks.  Windows  To build the client access engine under Windows, you'll need the following:  A Windows-native C++ development environment (e.g. MinGW or Visual Studio) Crypto++ zlib (until WinHTTP learns how to deal with Content-Encoding: gzip) SQLite or configure --without-sqlite FreeImage or configure --without-freeimage pthreads (MinGW) Optional dependency:  Sodium or configure --with-sodium To build the reference megacli.exe example, you will also need to procure development packages (at least headers and .lib/.a libraries) of:  GNU Readline/Termcap Folder syncing  In this version, the sync functionality is limited in scope and functionality:  There is no locking between clients accessing the same remote folder. Concurrent creation of identically named files and folders can result in server-side dupes.  Syncing between clients with differing filesystem naming semantics can lead to loss of data, e.g. when syncing a folder containing ABC.TXT and abc.txt with a Windows client.  On POSIX platforms, filenames are assumed to be encoded in UTF-8. Invalid byte sequences can lead to undefined behaviour.  Local filesystem items must not be exposed to the sync subsystem more than once. Any dupes, whether by nesting syncs or through filesystem links, will lead to unexpected results and loss of data.  No in-place versioning. Deleted remote files can be found in //bin/SyncDebris (only when syncing to the logged in account's own cloud drive - there is no SyncDebris facility on syncs to inbound shares), deleted local files in a sync-specific hidden debris folder located in the local sync's root folder.  No delta writes. Changed files are always overwritten as a whole, which means that it is not a good idea to sync e.g. live database tables.  No direct peer-to-peer syncing. Even two machines in the same local subnet will still sync via the remote storage infrastructure.  No support for unidirectional syncing (backup-only, restore-only). Syncing to an inbound share requires it to have full access rights.  megacli on Windows  The megacli example is currently not handling console Unicode input/output correctly if run in cmd.exe.  Filename caveats: Please prefix all paths with \\?\ to avoid the following issues:  The MAX_PATH (260 character) length limitation, which would make it impossible to access files in deep directory structures  Prohibited filenames (con/prn/aux/clock$/nul/com1...com9/lpt1...lpt9). Such files and folders will still be inaccessible through e.g. Explorer!  Also, disable automatic short name generation to eliminate the risk of clashes with existing short names.",https://github.com/PhongPham101190/Red-C-SDK,0

65aabdc6598472f39771c4d8,468690853,Industry-4.0-as-a-Catalyst-for-Sustainable-Development,"In the age of connected devices, the quest for efficient energy consumption has peaked more than ever. Various industries attempt to make their existing operations more sustainable to prevent the planet from further damage. It is especially true in the case of the manufacturing sector as it has now reached an undeniable inflection point of being transformed by the fourth industrial revolution. The move towards digital transformation requires the existing manufacturers to rely heavily on smart devices, equipment, cloud computing, IoT, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and many more, which collectively consume vast amounts of energy. For this reason, energy efficiency is forming the core of Industry 4.0 operations. According to US Energy Information Administration, industrial energy usage in Europe accounts for 26% of overall energy consumption. At the same time, the industrial sector in the United States accounts for roughly 32% of the country's overall energy consumption. With these facts in mind, it's evident that energy efficiency and Industry 4.0 are a must-have combination. Overall, manufacturing sector is deemed as unsustainable in the way it operates. Integrating technological systems can unlock the many sustainable benefits for it by enabling more flexibility, scalability, and reliability to the complete production system. According to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, sustainability is a crucial business strategy for the future. As a part of sustainability, energy efficiency forms an inherent component for smart manufacturing. Digital transformation of the manufacturing units primarily contributes to energy efficiency by allowing the energy sector to remodel its operating landscape and promote more intelligent, modern, and sophisticated energy production and distribution systems. In this pursuit, data is an excellent ally. By recognizing inefficient operations, optimizing production and logistics routing, and predicting maintenance needs, data gathered from sensors, processed with analytics, and fed into predictive models can contribute to energy savings. Data also enables virtual testing and modeling of equipment, processes, and plants with digital twins, allowing demand to be adjusted to energy price and availability, temperature control to be refined, and even R&D expenses to be reduced. Solulever, a Dutch technology startup, aims at bringing the revolution of Industry 4.0 to its customers by aligning them with sustainability performance. Brabo, a manufacturing connectivity and intelligence platform developed by Solulever, aims at integrating smart manufacturing at the existing manufacturing sites in a sustainable manner. The Industry 4.0 platform provides OT-IT connectivity at the shop floor by connecting to the edge devices and equipment for real-time decision-making. The data collected by these edge devices helps optimize the use of utilities such as energy, air, catalysts, and others. By analyzing the data collected by the smart sensors, wastage of the utilities can be determined to make the processes more efficient. With more sophisticated operations, energy can be consumed by the devices efficiently, further reducing its use to manage the waste produced by the manufacturing operations. Doing so, not only is there a reduction in waste production and power management, but there is also an additional saving of the energy conserved. Industry 4.0 seems to be the most sought after technology that paves path for tremendous success for manufacturing sector by reducing the negative impacts of the industry on the environment. As closing notes it can be said that, an immense potential can be seen in the way the industry can be transmuted to a better version of itself where it renders unimaginable solutions to the world alongside making it healthier.",https://github.com/solulevervision/Industry-4.0-as-a-Catalyst-for-Sustainable-Development,0

65aac2ddc9f95b8ca84ee73d,72624083,Transforming-Healthcare-through-IoT,"Look around and you will find people with smart devices that track their every move, calculate their intake and gives them trends on this data.  Primitively, Caregivers and hospitals were using telemetry to remotely gather data for improving patient care.  The primary aim of preventive healthcare was to deliver personalized care, improve patient care while reducing costs. However, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is driving the future of healthcare for better outcomes, improving efficiency and making healthcare more affordable as caretakers are increasingly resorting to more self- care due to increased awareness.  To get there, healthcare providers must make use of technology in a more systematic way.  The Scope of IoT is getting bigger and better in:      Preventive healthcare: by use of wearables.     Patient tracking: in monitoring patient movement and health analysis.     Geriatric care: in tracking Senior citizens which is a large market for IoT, medical devices.     Real-time location: in tracking medical devices, people and asset movement.  Gartner believes that 30% of smart wearables will be unobtrusive to the eye by 2017. it is predicted that the revenue from smart wearable devices will generate $22.9 billion by 2020.  Experts from P&S Market research expect that the healthcare Internet of Things industry will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37.6 percent between 2015 and 2020.  The rising need for advanced healthcare combined with the requirements of Affordable Care Act (ACA), technology in the industry is expected to grow through 2020  Wearables for preventive health analysis  Imagine a wearable used for preventive health analysis.  The term wearable in health parlance should not be restricted to just fitness tracking devices worn in the wrist that are used to monitor personal health.  By and far, this term should go beyond tracking of physical activities; it could be used as a communication device or it could even be a device that interacts with other devices like an Apple watch, track patients‚Äô body conditions, sleep patterns or any other critical information which may require immediate care.  It could be a device in the body, on the body or near the body like a medical app that helps track personal health;  Some of the industry medical apps that are already disrupting the healthcare market are      Philips‚Äô Medication Dispensing Service     Airfinder     Boiron Medicine Finder App     Future Path Medical‚Äôs Urosense     Digital Hospitals making headway  Healthcare is increasingly leveraging modern technology and digital hospitals are making headway such as the Humber River Hospital in Toronto Canada and the Medical Center at Mission Bay San Francisco. Innovative approaches towards engaging robots in the radiology and other departments are also disrupting the way healthcare is delivered.  Deakin University Australia, in partnership with Telstra Australia, has developed haptics-enabled robots that can perform ultrasound diagnostics remotely. This means the patient need not be in the same place as the sonographer conducting the ultrasound.  IoMT for improved healthcare  There were 165,000 mobile healthcare apps as of November 2015 and the mobile app marketplace is expected to grow 15 times faster, according to a survey.  Another survey shows users expect digital healthcare services to be able to communicate with doctors via their smartphones, monitor health and collaborate with care givers with ease.  IoMT is slowly and steadily reducing human intervention and dependency to provide early diagnosis and contributing to improved healthcare in accordance with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which focus on certified EHR (Electronic Health Record) to enhance efficiency and quality of patient care.  Conclusion:  With the cost of Hardware coming down, software enabling devices to talk to multiple devices across platforms is going to redefine the way people take care of their health.  The biggest change is going to be in Preventive Healthcare, making it the biggest gamechanger.",https://github.com/TVSNEXT/Transforming-Healthcare-through-IoT,0

Life expectancy depends on various factors: Regional variations, Economic Circumstances, Sex Differences, Mental Illnesses, Physical Illnesses, Education, Year of their birth and other demographic factors.  The project relies on the accuracy of the data. The Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under the World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries. The datasets are made available to the public for the purpose of health data analysis. The data-set related to life expectancy, health factors for 193 countries have been collected from the same WHO data repository website and its corresponding economic data was collected from the United Nations website. Among all categories of health-related factors, only those critical factors were chosen which are more representative.  This problem statement provides a way to predict the average life expectancy of people living in a country when various factors such as year, GDP, education, alcohol intake of people in the country, expenditure on the healthcare system, and some specific disease-related deaths that happened in the country are given.

Machine learning methods are commonly used across engineering and sciences, from computer systems to physics. Moreover, commercial sites such as search engines, recommender systems (e.g., Netflix, Amazon), advertisers, and financial institutions employ machine learning algorithms for content recommendation, predicting customer behavior, compliance, or risk.  As a discipline, machine learning tries to design and understand computer programs that learn from experience for the purpose of prediction or control.  In this course, you will learn about principles and algorithms for turning training data into effective automated predictions. We will cover:  Representation, over-fitting, regularization, generalization, VC dimension;  Clustering, classification, recommender problems, probabilistic modeling, reinforcement learning;  On-line algorithms, support vector machines, and neural networks/deep learning.  You will be able to:  Understand principles behind machine learning problems such as classification, regression, clustering, and reinforcement learning  Implement and analyze models such as linear models, kernel machines, neural networks, and graphical models  Choose suitable models for different applications  Implement and organize machine learning projects, from training, validation, parameter tuning, to feature engineering  You will implement and experiment with the algorithms in several Python projects designed for different practical applications.  You will expand your statistical knowledge to not only include a list of methods, but also the mathematical principles that link these methods together, equipping you with the tools you need to develop new ones.",https://github.com/newking9088/MITx_6.86x_Machine_Learning_with_Python-From_Linear_Models_to_Deep_Learning_Fall_2020,0
65aac2e5c9f95b8ca84ee780,327797833,adfa2,"# David's Personal Roadmap to Learning Data Science #### Based on the article [Learn Data Science for free in 2021](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2021/01/learn-data-science-free-2021.html) from KDnuggets. Some additions have been made. ###### I'm new to data science and programming. Some areas of study in this roadmap may be researched to a point of redundancy while materials for other topics could be seriously lacking. As I progress through this learning path, I'll be able to gauge which areas need more (or less) focus and will add and remove resources as needed.  ## Schoolwork ##### Required readings for my Data Science classes. - [ ] [Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline](https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Data-Science-Straight-Frontline/dp/1449358659) by Cathy O'Neil & Rachel Schutt   - [ ] 1.

As the potential of IoT is vast, the government of Malaysia decided to encourage the IoT technologies across different industries. With strong support from the government, locally based enterprises would find it easier to adopt and develop IoT technologies in their productions and daily operations.  Firstly, as Malaysia is preparing to join the wave of countries currently immersed in Industry 4.0, especially in its manufacturing and heavy industry sector, the government is pushing for more budget allocation for Industry 4.0. Moreover, with the current strong support from the government, more enterprises, especially SMEs, will be encouraged to adopt IoT technologies in their production, such as remote monitoring or automation.  To create a national ecosystem to enable the proliferation of use and industrialization of IoT as a new source of economic growth. IoT has the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring interaction by human-to-human or human-to-computer and interrelated mechanical and digital machines, computing devices, objects, animals or people that are provided with sole identifiers. It creates the information and knowledge to boost human intelligence, and productivity to enhance the quality of life.  IoT technology in Malaysia is based on two major market trends market and technology. The effect of these trends will enhance productivity, optimize resources by implementing new technology while maintaining individual needs. The economic potential of IoT for Malaysia is expected to experience exponential growth beyond 2020. Technology opportunities can be created by IoT in Malaysia with forecast technology opportunities for application and services, and device producers.  Agriculture, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation are sectors that are identified to have the most potential for IoT deployment in Malaysia. National IoT Strategic Roadmap aimed at nurturing a national ecosystem, Malaysia has articulated plans to get in on the IoT game and make Malaysia a regional IoT development hub. The roadmap estimates that Malaysia has a strong base in giving the well-developed telecommunications infrastructure, vibrant electrical and electronics industry, policy incentives and frameworks for intellectual property and cybersecurity protection to spur IoT domestically.  With knowledge of IoT becoming a necessary skill set for data scientists in Malaysia, the IoT training in Malaysia is ideal for professionals and fresher‚Äôs looking to enter the field of automated products and communication interfaces. Focusing on data capture, storage and data analytics, embedded electronics and client-server architecture, the course guides students to be adept at carving practical applications for modern day industries.  In IoT training, participants will discuss the Internet of Things (IoT) framework for the digital transformation and IoT strategic leadership. With ExcelR, You will gain an intensive overview of IoT in this new evolution in the sensor, cloud, and big data.  In Internet of Things training, you will be able to design independent IoT devices for sectors like retail, manufacturing and construction, understand the advantages of cloud storage, understand IoT communication protocols, comprehend IoT architecture and modern microcontrollers for data capture and signal relaying, make hardware compatible MCUs, set up a HTTP server and able to deploy python modules for basic data analytics.  The Internet of Things training (IoT training) in Malaysia is suitable for the people with good exposure towards IoT technology will be the best catch for the Industry and the people who are business analysts, technical architects, software engineers, IT managers, executives, and entrepreneurs can do this IoT training.
